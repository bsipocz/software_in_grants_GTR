capture</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Fellowship</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/H03319X/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This project aims to bring together motion capture technology with established movement practices which cultivate attention on bodily awareness, and in particular Skinner Releasing Technique (SRT), to explore how sensorial awareness can be captured and what visualisations might emerge. SRT is a pioneering approach to dance which has evolved from the simple principle that when we are letting go of habitual holding patterns we can move more freely, articulately and powerfully. Joan Skinner, the American choreographer, dance improvisation pioneer and former dancer with the Martha Graham and Merce Cunningham companies, created the technique from early experiments in the 1960s. SRT utilizes image-guided floorwork to ease tension and promote an effortless kind of moving, integrated with alignment of the whole self. Tactile exercises (partner 'graphics') are used to give the imagery immediate kinaesthetic effect: spontaneous movement is evoked by imagery and guided movement studies. Motion capture is a generic name for the techniques which obtain motion data from human performers for a wide range of applications including biomechanics, sports science, ergonomics, advertising, TV and 3D computer games. Regarded as a significant component of the film and games industries, motion capture is also incorporated into arts events but it demands a level of expertise to use it effectively that is not readily achieved by artists.\n\nThe project will explore how the methods and principles which characterise the practice of SRT and related practices can 'translate' to the production of visualisations for virtual environments, to shed light on contemporary ideas of interface design and display methods, and to understand more about SRT as a movement discipline. The aim is to enhance the interaction experience for audiences to produce new art experiences which are intellectually and socially engaging and can, through a re-engagement with the complexity of the moving body, generate new understandings about our relationship with our own body within the world. The project is therefore unique in that it will map a specific dance practice, embed this mapping within a game engine and test a variety of avatar visualisations in real time allowing audiences to interact and be directly involved in the process. Finally this interaction will be augmented by using these findings to immerse the player/performer into the action to create new performance spaces and experiences.\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project will benefit a wide range of external users, organisations and industry experts. It builds on longstanding relationships with companies, venues, organisations, arts professionals and science experts: it is a particular strength of the proposal that it is actively supported by technology companies in the commercial private sector, as well as by arts organisations and HEIs. The project will develop these relationships; it will contribute to industry knowhow and profitability and enhance cultural and educational organisations' own public engagement and learning activities; and it is likely also to be of value to engineering, biomechanical and biomedical science. The project's outputs will thus have economic, social, cultural and educational impact in the UK and overseas, both within and beyond the academic community. \n Arts/museums and industry/technology partners have a stake - cultural, financial - in ensuring wide public take-up of the project's deliverables, whether through participation in the artistic work or by use/purchase of the technological applications. HEI partners, whose interest in immersive and 3D technologies ranges from visual/media/performing arts to games to biosurgery, also have an interest in testing and trialling research outputs with wider constituencies in their own fields. \n The project's cultural, social and educational impact will be delivered through a range of public events. With administrative and marketing support from Coventry University's Institute for Creative Enterprise (ICE) and the University's communications team, the project leader will work in close partnership with UK-based and international venues, individuals and organisations who will exhibit/show work in progress and completed work. Public engagement will be via the exhibition/installation/show itself and via associated events, planned with host organisations in response to their own outreach requirements and including talks, demonstrations and workshops which will give audiences 'hands on' experience of the new technologies. The work in the Dome/Planetarium, in particular, will attract audiences interested in 3D technologies who will encounter and experience dance in different ways, experience interactive art and provide the project with valuable information about user engagement in new environments. Materials generated through the project, particularly those relating to teaching ideas and software developments, will be disseminated as widely as possible in accessible and attractive ways to reach wide audiences.\n The technological, economic and educational impact of the project will be through knowledge exchange with partners who have committed resources (expert advice, equipment) to the research programme. Via seminars, workshops, conferences and publications the project will provide outputs to academic researchers across the cited disciplines. These outputs will also have considerable value for training providers, in both the formal education and the commercial sectors, which use animation, performance, programming and 3D immersive technologies. Importantly, the research will support the commercial partners' development of wider uses for data capture technologies and muscle-modelling software, for entertainment, gaming, medical and other applications; and will enable market expansion both in the UK and overseas. The project leader, supported by the University's Business Development Team, will explore both commercial and non-commercial exploitation opportunities in collaboration with partners and other Coventry University faculties and institutes including the Serious Games Institute and the Health Design Technology Institute.\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-05-17</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-05-18</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>296050</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Model Gardeners present a series of new works that subtly place the viewer in a somewhat neurotic state of calm.

Abstract 

'Capturing Stillness: Visualisations of dance through motion capture technologies' is a three year AHRC fellowship which places a microscope on the dance practice Skinner Releasing Technique ( SRT) aligned with motion capture and game engine technologies to explore how motion capture technology can 'map' SRT and related practices to test out how notions of embodiment are 'read', visualised and transmitted; to understand the limits and possible expansion possibilities of motion capture technology. The research explores the impact of the work on understanding the core values and characteristics of somatic movement practices such as SRT.



The research investigates how interactive virtual environments and avatar behaviour can unearth and expose awarenesses about stillness and first-person sensorial experience to increase kinaesthetic engagement. The development of new applications for motion capture investigate the user/viewer/ mover relationship in immersive environments to understand more about the moving and sensing body. 



Significance, Rigour and Originality of the Output 

'Capturing Stillness: Visualisations of dance through motion capture technologies' is highly original and the first study of it's kind to interrogate SRT dance practice in the field of motion capture and interactive virtual environments. Many exhibitions, conference contributions and various other events and public engagement activities make clear the outcomes as an important part of the research which are already having an impact across the sector and are likely to have considerable benefit to a wide range of practitioners and researchers, worldwide. A careful sensitive approach to the research together with effective methodologies have ensured that those involved in the research have been part of the discoveries through Gibson's novel approaches to dissemination.



Invitations to share the research both in the UK and overseas is a significant achievement and endorses the importance of the research. Gibson has created links with motion.lab Deakin University Australia, University of Auckland New Zealand, University of Toronto and OCADU in Canada as well as being awarded a Christie Digital Systems and CAFKA award in Canada to undertake further research into CAVE environment development and VR intelligent systems. Closer to home between the ICELab, C-DaRE and the Serious Games Institute at Coventry University including external partners to extend research in dance and motion capture technologies and its application in arts and non-arts environments.



Gibson's AHRC research has made a valuable contribution to research in this area and developed new insights and applications, which are likely to be of value to a wide range of artists,technologist and scholars, within the UK and internationally. Gibson has worked effectively to provide new insights to somatic practices, which provides new knowledge and a wide range of artistic outputs, all of which have proved to have impact on researchers and artists, technology providers and movement educators. Significant important practice -led research is having impact.



Gibson received a best papers award in 2011 at the EVA Conference -Electronic Visualisation and the Arts British Computer Arts Society, London. She will be delivering her paper 'Gestalt Grace' at PSI- Performance Studies International, conference 19 at Stanford University.

Abstract

'VISITOR' was inspired by Gibson &amp;amp; Martelli's travels to the snow-driven mountains of the Canadian Rockies and developed following research at The Banff Arts Centre in Canada. 'Vermilion Lake' comprises a full-scale replica of a trappers cabin housing an interactive virtual environment. A companion moving image piece, 'where the bears are sleeping', depicts monochromatic imagery of glaciers, forests and frozen lakes. In both works, either a friendly or malevolent force is suggested, evoking the hunter being hunted, the tracker being tracked. Employing techniques used in video games, bringing exterior virtual space into the physical gallery space the exhibition plays with our apprehension of different forms of reality.

Gibson consistently challenges the boundaries as a leading artist and researcher working with interactive computer graphics in contemporary art. The VISITOR project is no exception and with Martelli and igloo she pioneers an immersive approach with high quality production values.



Significance, Rigour and Originality of the Output 

'VISITOR' involved a wide range of practice -based research in order to develop a new and experimental multi-media project for public presentation. The requirement to research and experiment in order to keep pace with new technological opportunities led the team to evolve creative, distinctive and highly disciplined models for collaboration with a wide range of professionals supporting research and production of new work. 'VISITOR' was developed through significant research into the liminal screen at the Banff New Media Institute in Canada. This opportunity led to new discoveries and professional development into CAVE, stereoscopic and Human Computer interfaces with a number of specialists and scholars in the field. The underlying principle for these collaborations was to develop and maintain contacts with growing developments in visual media. Through this approach a strong platform of international contacts, a broad catalogue of productions and a technical knowledge base in design, music, performance, software programming and engineering were achieved for mutual benefit. The aim of the project was to give viewers unique experiences, heightening perceptions and bringing the exterior virtual space into the interior physical space. This conceptual shift moved Gibson's practice forward from a performance background into the 3D world and video enabling exploration of avenues which would not have been possible conventionally, repositioning traditional artistic activities into the new spaces of games and virtual worlds.



The VISITOR project received an Arts Council Grants for the Arts Award, a Henry Moore Foundation Commission and support from the Banff Arts Centre in Canada. 



The project toured Nationally in association with artsdepot and with it workshops were delivered in Unreal game engine technology and motion capture technologies. Lectures, seminars and presentations included an array of methodological processes and technical approaches required to deliver such an ambitious transmedia project. Bringing together sound artists, engineers, computer programmers, a skilled team creating a novel Human Computer Interface, a boat with oars developed as an haptic device to engage with the work.

 

'VISITOR' was presented to MP's at Westminster in November 2011 by Julie Lomax ( then Head of Visual Arts at Arts Council England) as an outstanding piece of work. Audience figures reached 35,000 visitors at 5 national venues.

Abstract 

'MocApp' allows you to view &amp;amp; sequence motion capture data in the .htr format. The app builds a simple stick figure from the joint structure of the take and was developed to allow easy viewing of mocap data without requiring users to have access to specialist software.__The motion capture app was developed through Gibson's AHRC Creative Fellowship at Coventry University School of Art &amp;amp; Design with the generous support of motion.lab, Deakin University, Australia. Her project Capturing Stillness: Visualisations of dance through motion capture is a unique exploration of the interface between motion capture technologies and Skinner Releasing Technique (SRT). Focussing on the poetic imagery cited in the pedagogy, dance interpretations are motion captured and new visualisations are generated from these to create immersive artworks with the view to enhance kinesthetic experience in 3D worlds. 

Acquiring knowledge from the AHRC research and collaborating internally &amp;amp; externally has helped create both the App and the content. The software development brings together Ruth Gibson &amp;amp; 16 international SRT dancers, Bruno Martelli (Gibson/Martelli -igloo), Dr Alex Woolner (SGI), Daniel Skovli (motion.lab) &amp;amp; Melbourne based programmer Scott Ashton - who previously worked with media art pioneer Jeffrey Shaw

._

Significance, Rigour and Originality of the Output 

MocApp was developed to incorporate new applications for motion capture into the investigation of user/viewer/mover relationships. Through these new applications Gibson extends her research into learning more about the moving and sensing body and with it exploring the interface between motion capture technology &amp;amp; movement practices opening up relationships between motion capture/movement tracking and the dancing body.

Gibson co-ordinated a group of 16 SRT dance practitioners from seven different countries to be captured in the studio to create a library of 3D motion captures. Seven periods of motion capture laboratories have been undertaken in the UK and Australia.These dance performances have been compiled to make a unique movement database which provides content for the research. Spin offs included new methodologies for capturing and motion capture workshops.

 

The enormous task of cleaning the data involved over 500 takes, approximately one minute each cumulated in over eight hours of material. This has been achieved by managing a small team of programmers. This process has involved Gibson co-ordinating the MocApp team and provisioning and managing the Appstore archaeology.



Gibson decided to make a motion capture viewer as part of her research process, conceptualising the mocap viewer as an iOs app 'MocApp' to allow performance students, choreographers and animators to easily look at and sequence mocap data, without having to access specialised software or high end PC's. The app can be distributed through the AppStore, the intention is that mocap providers or animators can quickly put takes onto the internet and users with the app can quickly download and view the results - and use in the rehearsal, planning &amp;amp; editing processes. The app also has an Augmented Reality (AR) function which was designed so that performances can be evaluated as a life sized overlay to the real world. 



The app has also been generalised in that the mocap file format which can be read is a general purpose and easy to create motion file format. 'MocApp' is a didactic tool which represents new IP and could be developed into a library &amp;amp; unique archive which may be a new business opportunity.



Gibson hopes that in the future revenue from sales of the app could allow for further development. This creative, innovative tool and new approach may be of interest to the Serious Games Institute at Coventry University and a variety of Motion Capture Providers. At the Games Developers Conference in March 2013 Gibson was approached by Animatrik a Vancouver based film and design company to develop a bespoke tailor made version for their Virtual Production services and Performance Capture studios.
