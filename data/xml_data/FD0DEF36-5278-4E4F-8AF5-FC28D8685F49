This has come in part from the discovery of prions in yeast and other fungi. Historically, prions have been intensively studied in relation to their ability to cause diseases such as 'Mad Cow Disease' and the human form, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD). However the discovery of prions in fungi that can potentially be of benefit to the host organism suggests that prions may actually represent an entirely new form of protein-based heredity. One such prion-based 'epigenetic' determinant in Baker's Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) will be studied in this project; the so-called [PSI+] prion. This prion can significantly alter the way that the yeast cell responds to certain toxic chemicals for example. The approach we are planning to take is a novel one, integrating biological experiments with mathematical modelling to study the behaviour of prions in a living yeast cell. This is an approach we first developed on a previous BBSRC-funded project and this new project builds on that, broadening the approach to model the process by which prions are replicated in an asymmetrically dividing yeast cell. Our long-term goal is to understand fully the molecular details of exactly how prions are so effectively generated and then passed on to other yeast cells. We already know that this requires cells to produce prion 'seeds' which can be passed from the mother cell to the daughter cell (a process we refer to as prion transmission). These seeds - which we refer to as propagons - are generated by breaking up much larger aggregated forms of the prion protein that are found in yeast cells. By employing a multidisciplinary approach we aim to establish the mechanism that operates in the growing yeast cell to ensure that new prion seeds are efficiently generated and transmitted to a new daughter cell. The research project will be built upon an iterative process of model improvement through biological experiments conducted to allow estimation of model parameters and then assessment of the adequacy of the new models that emerge. This approach will provide us, for example, with the ability to assess and ultimately predict the way in which changes in the cell's make up or function may impact on prion replication and/or transmission. The outcome will be a new understanding of how this important class of 'epigenetic' elements - some 20 of which have now been described - are replicated in the living cell, and how that process can be perturbed. The findings will guide future studies on the processes both in fungi and in mammals. A longer term outcome of the research will be identifying components of the cell that can be targeted by new drugs to block the generation and/or transmission of prion seeds.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The stable propagation of yeast prions requires the continued generation of new prion seeding molecular entities (propagons) and their efficient transmission to daughter cells at cell division. We have developed a novel, stochastic modelling approach to establishing the key molecular events in the propagation and transmission of the [PSI+] prion. Our current models provide an important phenomenological description of how the [PSI+] prion is eliminated in the absence of a mechanism to generate new propagons. In this new project we will develop new mechanistic models that not only take into account the kinetics of prion protein polymerisation but also polymer fragmentation in the growing yeast cell. To achieve this we will generate stochastic simulation models for yeast prion polymer kinetics and support this model building by experimentally establishing the values of the important model factors including the cellular levels of Sup35p and the key chaperone proteins Hsp104 and Sis1p, the number and sizes of Sup35p prion polymers and the rate of synthesis and turnover of Sup35p in its various cellular forms. To evaluate the emerging simulation models we will assess the in vivo consequences of modulating levels of Sup35p, Hsp104 and Sis1p all of which are essential for [PSI+] propagation. One crucial parameter in our models is pi, the proportion of propagons transmitted to the daughter cell. We will identify factors that lead to a change in pi, particularly in relation to the number and length of Sup35p polymers in the cell. Throughout the project we will carry out model sensitivity and validation studies in the light of experimental data obtained in order to generate a definitive stochastic simulation model for yeast prion polymer kinetics in the dividing cell. This project involves a close interplay between bioscience-led research and integrated mathematical modelling with the aim of shedding new light on how infectious amyloids are generated and transmitted in vivo.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>In terms of research findings: the primary beneficiaries will be researchers in the academic and pharmaceutical sectors who are exploring both the underlying molecular mechanism of amyloid formation and the resulting disease states. A further dimension of the impact of the research proposed comes from the realisation that yeast prions represent a completely novel class of epigenetic regulator are likely to exist in other organisms and have a major impact on cellular functions and development. Kent Innovation &amp;amp; Enterprise (KIE), the university's dedicated business development unit, will provide full support and guidance on any business opportunities that may arise from research findings made. In terms of staff training; the project will provide the two appointed PDRAs with an opportunity to develop multidisciplinary skills combining experimental biology and mathematical modeling techniques. Training will be provided for the PDRAs to develop these new skills through the project and its investigators, through courses available within the host Departments and also through the Faculty-run 'Researcher Skills Training' programmes at the University of Kent. The training of a new cohort of young scientists with a combination of biological and mathematical skills is important if we are to make effective use of mathematical models to describe complex biological systems, that is increasingly becoming the approach of choice. In terms of dissemination: in addition to the usual publication of methods and results in a range of academic, peer-reviewed journals (including top international journals for statistical methods as well as for novel developments in biology), a variety of strategies will be used to ensure that others have the opportunity to benefit from this research without the delays naturally arising from the peer-reviewed publication route. For example, as part of our previous BBSRC-funded project (96/E18382) we established a web site dedicated to our collaborative project, the methods developed and its scientific outputs, including computer software. As part of this new project we would continue to exploit this dissemination route but also increase the outreach component of the web material. These strategies will be coupled with a wide range of poster presentations and seminars at national and international conferences.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>589288</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Cafe Scientifique presentations</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>25E95A36-B0A9-4C25-A90E-AF1E525EAB9F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Tuite presented a talk in a local Caf&amp;eacute; Scientifique entitled &amp;quot;Senile yeast&amp;quot; in which he described the use of yeast to explore

This involved 2-3 days per person per year visiting the School and participating in activities such as laboratory classes. This ongoing novel project involves years 12 and 13 school students carrying out research into multiple sclerosis by expressing myelin basic protein in yeast and characterising the purified protein (see www.mbp-squared.org). In 2012 the project was rolled out nationally, again with Wellcome Trust support and badged as the 'Authentic Biology' project that now engages some 1000 year 12 and 13 students a year in a variety of research projects across the UK (see www.authenticbiology.org). Naeimi acted as a technical aid and teacher, demonstrating techniques at workshops and providing project support.

The Authentic Biology has a national profile, has generated in excess of &amp;pound;500,000 funding from the Wellcome Trust and the project has and continues to receive wide coverage over the last three years from the local and national press, the scientific press (e.g. a Nature podcast; www.nature.com/nature/podcast/index-2013-11-21.html) and TV and radio interviews. This project has had a significant impact on the Langton School resulting in a doubling of the number of years 12/13 studying biology.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5462143ad6c931.43565303</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.authenticbiology.org</gtr:url><gtr:year>2008,2009,2010,2011,2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The main outcome of our project has been a new understanding of how this emerging class of 'epigenetic' elements are so effectively replicated in the cell, but also what changes can lead to it being perturbed.

However, the discovery of prions in fungi that can potentially be of benefit to the host organism suggests that prions may actually represent an entirely new form of protein-based heredity. One such prion-based 'epigenetic' determinant in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was the focus of our project; the so-called [PSI+] prion. This prion can significantly alter the way that the yeast cell responds to certain toxic chemicals for example.

Our long-term goal was to unravel the complex mechanism by which this prion (and other yeast prions) is able to multiply in the growing cell. We already knew some of the major players in this, in particular proteins known as chaperones. Our approach was a novel one: to integrate biological experiments with mathematical modelling to interrogate the behaviour of prions in a living yeast cell. This is an approach we first developed in a previous collaboration (funded by the BBSRC: ref no. E18382) in which we explored the impact of inhibiting the ability of a cell to propagate the prion by preventing one of the chaperones (called Hsp104) from functioning as it should. By modelling this we were able to make a number of predictions that have subsequently been followed up by biochemical and genetic experiments. 

In this new project we built on this by broadening the approach to modelling the process by which prions are replicated in an asymmetrically dividing yeast cell. Key to this understanding was the recognition that we must understand fully the molecular details of exactly how prions are so effectively generated and then passed on to other yeast cells. We already knew these required cells to produce prion 'seeds' which can be passed from the mother cell to the daughter cell (a process we refer to as prion transmission). In this project we developed for the first time, analytical methods to identify and characterise these entities and found that they consist of a large number of molecules of the prion strung together. By employing a multidisciplinary approach we went on to gain new insights into the mechanism that operates in the growing yeast cell to ensure that new prion seeds are efficiently generated and transmitted to a new daughter cell. 

The research programme was built upon an iterative process of model improvement through biological experiments conducted to allow estimation of model parameters and then assessment of the adequacy of the new models that emerge. This approach provided us with the ability to assess and ultimately predict the way in which changes in the cell's make up or function impacted on prion replication and/or transmission. We also made a number of unexpected observations including the apparent dynamic behaviour of these aggregates when one modulates either the levels of key proteins such as chaperones, or when the cell is asked to grow in a different environment; for example using a different carbon source to glucose.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The main outcome of our project has been a new understanding of how this emerging class of 'epigenetic' elements are so effectively replicated in the cell, but also what changes can lead to it being perturbed.

The YeastSim++ library provides an abstract simulation environment which can be used to develop a variety of stochastic models in biology. It was used in the project to implement several different prion models from the recent literature. It was also used to simulate the well-known Lotka-
Volterra model of predator-prey dynamics, for which there are numerous existing implementations, allowing YeastSim++ to
be tested thoroughly.</gtr:description><gtr:id>918B1CEB-6126-4C76-8A36-46899353FE95</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None as yet but currently being exploited by the applicants with a view to generating second generation models of prion behaviour in dividing yeast cells.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54620df7d23417.20716118</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>YeastSim++</gtr:title><gtr:type>Software</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.kent.ac.uk/smsas/publications/2011techreps.html</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2011</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6AA71BAD-043A-4736-9CD0-E94015C93D43</gtr:id><gtr:title>Over-expression of the molecular chaperone Hsp104 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae results in the malpartition of [PSI] propagons.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Molecular microbiology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e209773093d6680f182f21c2d29c69c6"><gtr:id>e209773093d6680f182f21c2d29c69c6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ness F</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0950-382X</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58c6b1fe8ec510.68684004</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>07A63E9E-6211-440A-8982-AFE591402BCE</gtr:id><gtr:title>YeastSim++: UKC/SMSAS/11/016</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/fccbe866ab62c4c2381ef0fcd0c91b70"><gtr:id>fccbe866ab62c4c2381ef0fcd0c91b70</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Giagos V</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5462193310b398.76954610</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>EC0E0917-9861-4AFB-BC5C-C2DB3819289F</gtr:id><gtr:title>The life of [PSI].</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Current genetics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c9f29adc281998f6201874096ac71a77"><gtr:id>c9f29adc281998f6201874096ac71a77</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cox B</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0172-8083</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5aa6a7f9bd2309.40181068</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>18CC6166-DA89-4515-9626-73BB124D42A0</gtr:id><gtr:title>Models for the Prion dynamics in Yeast cells: a review: UKC/SMSAS/12/014</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/fccbe866ab62c4c2381ef0fcd0c91b70"><gtr:id>fccbe866ab62c4c2381ef0fcd0c91b70</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Giagos V</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>54621d0078eab5.71122098</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4A2380D9-3525-4C9C-915E-CA86A4628D8E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Fungal prions as epigenetic determinants</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Biochemist</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5a93621f310289adf1b12406831bcf82"><gtr:id>5a93621f310289adf1b12406831bcf82</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Naeimi WR</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>544651fd08c763.53643579</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F5235E46-7BE0-40D7-862A-D62C7A7C8E23</gtr:id><gtr:title>Kinetic models of guanidine hydrochloride-induced curing of the yeast [PSI+] prion.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of theoretical biology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b41c41a2f05f85d908dfca04cada4eba"><gtr:id>b41c41a2f05f85d908dfca04cada4eba</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Palmer KJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0022-5193</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>54621d29c20df2.30775079</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9D925685-F0B0-4FD2-BA14-5FF3E8BA7798</gtr:id><gtr:title>Human TorsinA can function in the yeast cytosol as a molecular chaperone.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Biochemical journal</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/95a76a051d957449717ccd378f50abd3"><gtr:id>95a76a051d957449717ccd378f50abd3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Adam I</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0264-6021</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a350f1914e058.59157884</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>087472C5-86DD-4092-896A-87189F423094</gtr:id><gtr:title>The prion hypothesis: from biological anomaly to basic regulatory mechanism.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nature reviews.
