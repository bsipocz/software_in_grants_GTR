In Chile and other Latin American countries specifically, existing educational systems need to be enhanced to provide better opportunities for the social mobility and personal development of young people. To contribute to the extant debates within policy, practice and theory, the proposed project aims at comparatively examining young people's access to educational and work opportunities in four different countries (UK, Chile, Germany and Finland), focusing hereby on their transitions firstly between school and university/higher education and secondly between university/higher education and the workplace. 
Findings of the planned multidisciplinary (education, sociology, psychology, management and organisation studies), cross-cultural research are expected to contribute to an enhanced understanding of the role higher education plays in the social structure in times of educational reforms in Chile, whilst also informing public policy and practice in the other three countries and further countries facing challenges relating to their educational system and equality, alongside the academic debate on life domain/stage transitions. The four specific countries have been identified as interesting cases for the research because they differ greatly on key dimensions (i.e., social equality, income, culture, educational systems) relating and/or relevant to the education, socialisation and work entry of young people. 
Following an initial systematic review of the extant literature, we will adopt a mixed methods design to examine young people's transitions at key points in their lives, triangulating findings from three sources of data. Specifically, we will carry out a quantitative survey, aiming to collect data from a mixed sample of 150 young people in each of the four countries. The survey will include questions focusing on individuals' experiences of transitions between secondary school and higher education, as well as between secondary school/higher education and work, in order to better understand the interplay of access to opportunities, as well as recruitment, selection and support mechanisms in universities and organisations. It will also investigate individuals' experiences of transitions in terms of psychological outcomes, such as their well-being. To deepen findings from the survey, and enhance understanding of the issues examined, we will further conduct 20 individual interviews per country with both policymakers, representatives of educational authorities and organisations, as well as individuals that have experienced already transitions between education and work or are going through such changes in their lives currently. Amongst others, we seek to explore individuals' life stories, public policy and organisational mechanisms through these interviews, aiming hereby to gain insight into the role played by inclusion/exclusion mechanisms and how individuals, governments and local agencies may grant or block equal access to opportunities. Secondary data, such as existing survey and statistical data, will be gathered from governments, think tank and other relevant bodies to supplement the primary data collected quantitatively and qualitatively. 
Aside from seeking to contribute to the improvement of individuals' access to higher education and job markets by providing a more evidence-based understanding of how educational organisations relate to social structures and opportunities to policy-makers and representatives of educational authorities, findings of the proposed project are further expected to contribute to existing academic debates: Not only will our study be the first to compare transitions between school, university and work across four very different countries, we will also examine specific transitional aspects that have been somewhat neglected by the research community.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Aside from targeting an academic audience, we also intend to reach local, national and international authorities and policy-makers, public and political campaigners and practitioners. Through this, we aim at impacting on wider societal audiences by providing insight and learning on the topics investigated in our project (i.e., links of education and social mobility, role of organisational assessment and selection mechanisms). 
Firstly, taking advantage of the current social and political climate in Chile, where educational knowledge is becoming increasingly demanded by different social actors, and educational and social changes are pursued, we will publish project briefings via social networks, thus aiming for the project to gain traction in everyday society and to what is already an involved audience. In addition, we will email (e.g., via a newsletter) these briefings to specific individuals (e.g., local and national authorities, policymakers, think tanks directors, student union presidents) that may have an interest in the topics researched. Finally, we plan to hold workshop in which our findings will be discussed and interpreted from a citizens' perspective, this also involving further relevant experts, practitioners and policymakers. Through the above, we seek to contribute with evidence-based ideas to the current social debates about the role of education and reforms. 
Our public engagement policy in Chile will also include a dedicated project website (in Spanish and English language), enabling different audiences (practitioners, authorities, campaigners, leaders and policy makers) to gain access to the plans and findings of our project. This website will be updated regularly to reflect the project's progress and will feature content written in laymen's language to facilitate wider understanding. In addition, we intend to write opinion columns in the local and national press in order to reach broader audiences. Whenever possible, and within the remit of our project, we will be available for talks and seminars organised by relevant stakeholder groups. This, we expect, will further contribute to a more informed social debate and more informed decision-making within Chile. 
Secondly, since our proposed project is intended to reach broader audiences at international levels, we will email project briefings to ministries of education and work in other Latin American and lower income countries. Briefings, data and results will further be available for sharing with international agencies, such as UNESCO, World Bank or the IMF, given that these bodies are very important for designing policies and they often act as advisors for reforms and assessment of educational outcomes. 
The aforementioned website will be an important platform for communicating ideas and findings of our project not only to a Chilean and Latin American audience, but much more widely, our aim being to attract visitors from around the world, who will be able to access simplified data and analysis throughout the lifespan of the project (as well as more complex and comprehensive data following project completion; please see Data Management Plan). The website will also provide summaries from and insights into any workshops and other activities we will organise and attend and will have a facility for website visitors to provide their thoughts and feedback, which we can take into account for future research and practice endeavours. Finally, by making data accessible not only to fellow researchers, but also to practitioners and students, we expect that the issues examined in our project could be discussed in broader social contexts. 
In the UK, we intend to hold two full-day workshop to stimulate knowledge exchange and discussion in regards to our own research and the wider societal debates relating to educational transitions and access to education; for these workshops, we aim to attract practitioners and representatives from local and national authorities.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>158798</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>42A89EF9-E844-47E6-9C72-638FABB4C10D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Transitions across life: Towards a multilevel model of the transitions between education and the workplace</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e9860b885ed854f8a7221fed1d0de71d"><gtr:id>e9860b885ed854f8a7221fed1d0de71d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hernandez, J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58b59457105330.92049900</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1F13589D-F4A7-42BA-9142-1FC7E71B3AAB</gtr:id><gtr:title>Great expectations?
