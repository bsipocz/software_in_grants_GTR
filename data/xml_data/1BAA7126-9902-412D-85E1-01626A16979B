The series of four seminars and two workshops created space to consider the extent to which ?interdependence? is or could be a powerful reference point in demanding both policy and public engagement in the issues. Participation included natural and social scientists, plus policy and communications professionals and artists. Yet they went further to explore the ethical implications of research as much as the work itself: What kinds of response/responsibilities are implied by new knowledge in these fields, not just for the policy community, but also for researchers? Environmental policy and political debates have drawn freely on a stock of environmentalist rhetoric regarding interconnections. The academic community, while more wary and often critical of this rhetoric, are nursing similar assumptions and commitments, albeit implicitly.&lt;br />&lt;br />The seminar series worked to reveal these and reflect upon their consequences. The series of seminars invited participants to work with both broad theoretical work and specific cases to probe the significance of notions of interdependence. The seminar series linked to, and fed, the communications and research project Interdependence Day. That project has resulted in a web and print 'ATLAS' publication, a popular multi author volume and two academic journal articles, as well as informing the design of ensuing projects including &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.open.ac.uk/creativeclimate&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>Creative Climate&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.open.ac.uk/researchcentres/osrc/research/themes/mediating-change&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>Mediating Change&lt;/a> &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>20522</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>New Maps for an Island Planet</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>06424211-6A37-43F3-BCBD-757706CD505C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>OU geographer Doreen Massey, architect and author of Hungry City, Carolyn Steel, and campaigner and writer Andrew Simms sketch out ways of navigating the complex challenges presented by global economic and ecological crises. Chaired by Quentin Cooper, and joined by poet Lemn Sissay, the panel were part of an event to launch ATLAS: Architecture, geography and change in an interdependent world, edited by Renata Tyszczuk, Joe Smith, Nigel Clark, Melissa Butcher (Black Dog, February 2012).



The production of the ATLAS was supported by the Frederick Soddy Trust which offers support for study which includes human geography: the social, economic and cultural life of specific regions within the United Kingdom, Ireland or elsewhere in the world.



ATLAS presents new work by the Open University OpenSpace Research Centre and its collaborators, including the University of Sheffield Department of Architecture. The panel discussion was followed by public 'doctors' surgeries', conversations in the company of a specialist to help diagnose the challenges we face. The event marked the fourth of the OU Open Space annual Doreen Massey Lectures and was co-organised by the Southbank Literary programme.

Over 1/3 of the audience (around 100 people) participated in small group discussions exploring specific chapters and themes with authors from the ATLAS, which itself represented a gathering together of many threads of the Interdependence Day project, which had been initiated with support from a seminar series funded by ESRC/NERC.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-1907806361.00825522b4542f8</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.open.ac.uk/researchcentres/osrc/events/doreen-massey-4-new-maps-for-an-island-planet</gtr:url><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The seminar series supported a number of findings, some theoretical, some more practical:



1. Global environmental change issues need to be communicated as more dynamic and plural than some of the dominant framings



2. Interdisciplinary working is rewarding but relies heavily on 'interdisciplinary people': event and publication design helps, but there is little replacement for engaged and open-minded people in permitting a culture of exchange 



3. A diverse but integrated programme of outputs can help to reach different audiences.



4. Interdependence is a potent but diffuse term: we found it a good word to gather around, but more difficult to then work with, and found ourselves pursuing more focused questions that spurred off it.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We know that the popular book 'Do Good Lives' has, for example, inspired the Good Museums project and been drawn on widely by people in the new economics and transition movements. With a bundle of outputs that have included podcasts, a popular edited book (translated into Catalan), a more academic/arts community book, two journal articles and a sellout event at the Southbank Centre's Purcell rooms we offered plenty of different ways for different kinds of audiences to engage with the work that was initiated in the seminar series.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>3F4EBCCC-6980-42B2-8DFF-48A6DF703334</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-3545283352.532687777512982</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Energy,Environment,Leisure Activities/ including Sports/ Recreation and Tourism,Government/ Democracy and Justice,Manufacturing/ including Industrial Biotechology,Culture/ Heritage/ Museums and Collections,Retail,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.open.ac.uk/socialsciences/interdependenceday/index.shtml</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E33051E4-118B-4AE3-AEB3-A5A6D1A95BA2</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Interdependence Day Project</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The International Journal of the Arts in Society: Annual Review</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d46dc28a53e3e7dbb98c412f1ff766a2"><gtr:id>d46dc28a53e3e7dbb98c412f1ff766a2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Smith J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>m_230763486113a689bc</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D3FB034C-5063-4546-8A58-84453F218A9E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Interdependence</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Geography Compass</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d46dc28a53e3e7dbb98c412f1ff766a2"><gtr:id>d46dc28a53e3e7dbb98c412f1ff766a2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Smith J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2007-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cfbbfbb6509f2b</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8A58FC01-7E78-41E4-91D0-483087AE67DE</gtr:id><gtr:title>Atlas: Geography, Architecture and Change in an Interdependent World</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/414d4f0044e31aee3aa33e4d958db1fe"><gtr:id>414d4f0044e31aee3aa33e4d958db1fe</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Tyszczuk, Renata; Smith, Joe; Clark, Nigel, Butcher, Melissa</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-907317-39-2</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>i_96716158143bb2f102</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">RES-496-25-4015</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-496-25-4015</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>B57EEFB7-602E-4F5D-92E4-A0C265266249</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Demography &amp; human geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
