The project will focus on how the presence or absence of routes, infrastructures and flows has been seen to affect the connectivity of communities, strengthen or weaken social, cultural, political, economic, spatial and temporal ties, and enable or constrain alternative connective relations. The project will assess research undertaken on the role of infrastructures in nation-state formation, transnational enterprises (e.g. European routes), imperial configurations, and practices of dissent and protest against these. The project will also comprise of a scoping study for a follow-on project on the role of transport infrastructures in uniting and dividing communities within a particular sub-state national territory: Wales. This will look at the perceived role of transport infrastructures in either strengthening Welsh national cohesiveness or in weakening its internal ties through closer links (conceived at the British national scale) with adjacent regions of England. As part of the research review a workshop will be organised with eleven world-leading experts working on themes of mobility, transport history and the networking of communities.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In addition to the academic beneficiaries, our research review of literatures on transport infrastructures, networking and communities, and our scoping exercise on Welsh /British transport infrastructures, is likely to be of interest to a wide-range of non-academic groups, and our communications plans are intended to target three sets of beneficiaries. 

Firstly, we will communicate our research findings to policy-makers working in government and political parties. Towards the end of the research project we will produce a policy summary statement which we will circulate to civil servants at the UK Department for Transport, Welsh Assembly Government Transport Department, members of the House of Commons Transport Select Committee, the transport and planning departments of Welsh county councils, and national political parties (Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, Green Party, Scottish National Party). 

Secondly, the findings of the research and scoping review will be communicated to a wide range of non-governmental organisations working on themes of transport, mobility, community and sustainability through a policy summary statement that is likely to be of interest to groups who are working towards more inclusive national, regional and local transport policies, including the Community Transport Association, Sustrans, the Campaign for Better Transport, and Welsh national organisations such as Menter a Busnes. The PI is a member of the Transport Network of the Welsh Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods, and he will use this network to communicate findings to nonacademic groups who have representation in the network, including the Community Transport Association, Sustrans Cymru, Passenger Focus and the Welsh Assembly Government. 

Thirdly, the project findings will be summarised in a press released which will be targeted at the national and local media (particularly the Welsh media, and Welsh language media). In doing this we will utilise the expertise of Aberystwyth University's press office and draw upon our own experiences of communicating our previous research findings through television, radio and popular magazines.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>25323</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project investigated how transport infrastructures and mobility practices network and connect communities at different scales in different geographical and historical contexts. The project investigated foundational questions about what qualify as communities, and it examined how communities are connected at different scales, i.e. what connects? and by implication, what divides communities? The final report is focussed around four key themes - infrastructures, technologies, materialities; mobile practices; scales; and politics. Subsequent sections outline: the key findings of a scoping exercise on a future project on Wales; the format of the international workshop; the recommendations for future research and action; the outputs achieved and planned; and a bibliography of key publications in the area.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Recommendations for future research and action
A number of key areas for future research and dissemination have emerged from the research review, scoping study, and international workshop. In particular, we have identified the following needs:
? To develop research projects which examine the specific ways in which transport infrastructures and mobility practices have either facilitated or hindered constructions of community in different cultural contexts and at different scales.
? To develop research projects which are sensitive to the banal and mundane ways in which transport infrastructures are enrolled into 'group-making' projects, whether by local communities or in the formation of regional or national identities.
? To develop research projects which examine the histories (as well as the geographies) of connectivity, and the ways in which changes in transport and communications have shaped communities.

In order to fulfil these recommendations we intend to undertake the following: 
? To develop a large-scale research project which examines the ways in which transport infrastructures and mobility practices have been positioned as central to both the maintenance and erosion of Welsh (and, in contrast, British) national cohesiveness and community. 
? To disseminate the findings of the historical scoping study on Wales to a range of academic and non-academic beneficiaries, including specific departments in the British and Welsh governments, non-governmental organisations concerned with transport, community, the environment and Welsh affairs, and the general public through the Welsh media. Dissemination to non-academic audiences will occur after the academic papers from the project are submitted for review.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A326387E-D07F-4093-A140-667887D80937</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56bc97539bf636.41336683</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/documents/project-reports-and-reviews/connected-communities/connecting-youth-with-geographic-communities/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>ACAD023A-9BDE-4B14-95A2-80ED07AC3F25</gtr:id><gtr:title>Nations, materialities and affects</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Progress in Human Geography</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/881ca800788bd59a57d13c95f4aa7c28"><gtr:id>881ca800788bd59a57d13c95f4aa7c28</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Merriman P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>589a5d7dc5b762.00875794</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F8563133-FB03-4800-A4A8-05BB9E8308B6</gtr:id><gtr:title>&amp;quot;Networking communities: mobility, nationalism and the historical geographies of connective infrastructures&amp;quot; (Report)</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c8475ac5f440c629407a35be63540442"><gtr:id>c8475ac5f440c629407a35be63540442</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Merriman, P.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56bc93900ff3a6.65542525</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>85C972B1-00F2-48FE-8B21-34D5CB752781</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Routledge Handbook of Mobilities</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/881ca800788bd59a57d13c95f4aa7c28"><gtr:id>881ca800788bd59a57d13c95f4aa7c28</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Merriman P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780415667715</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>589a64e666cd27.41250403</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4EB626F7-2C1C-489B-9761-7DF1DCC40DEE</gtr:id><gtr:title>Mobility: geographies, histories, sociologies</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Transfers: Interdisciplinary Journal of Mobility Studies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c8475ac5f440c629407a35be63540442"><gtr:id>c8475ac5f440c629407a35be63540442</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Merriman, P.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56bc9507b4fae8.55724945</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/J011207/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8990E5FE-B44F-4A5B-8FDE-0610A5BE98C4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
