Liverworts occupy the pivotal position in the land plant evolutionary tree with a wide variety of evidence supporting these non-vascular plants as the most basal terrestrial photosynthetic organisms and amongst the earliest colonizers of the land ca.475 Ma. Recent molecular genetic evidence supports the view that mycorrhiza-like associations in liverworts are a basal and ancestral trait, and land plants evolved from a single common ancestor that formed symbiotic associations with fungal partners before roots evolved. For at least the past 30 years, the prevailing paradigm has been that AM fungi are the ancestral form of all plant-fungal symbioses co-evolving with the earliest land plants. AM associations are the most common type of mycorrhiza, and are currently found in over 70% of land plant species including simple and complex thalloid liverworts. However, new evidence reported by members of the project team (MB, JGD, SP) has revealed that the most basal extant groups of liverworts, the Haplomitriopsida, exclusively form associations with the most basal group of plant-symbiotic fungi - the Endogonales. For the first time, we now have evidence pointing to the identity of the fungal group at the dawn of their nutritional symbiosis with land plants. This opens a remarkable new window for functional investigations into how the symbiosis facilitated the emergence of the terrestrial biosphere.
Our proposal exploits these findings by addressing three fundamental evolutionary questions relating to the initial phase of plants 'greening of the Earth': (1) Are the associations between liverworts and species of Endogone functionally equivalent to those formed with AM fungal partners? (2) Was the switching of fungal partners from facultatively saprotrophic Endogone to obligately biotrophic AM fungi through the evolutionary advance of basal liverworts driven by increasing mutualistic benefits to the plants and fungi? (3) Did the accumulation of soil organic matter favour obligately biotrophic AM fungi over facultatively saprotrophic Endogone in supplying mineral nutrients to the plants?
We have carefully selected 7 liverwort species with fungal associations that provide a powerful spectrum of model systems amenable to experimentation and quantitative functional analyses of C exchange, nutrient relationships and fungal specificity. All of our target organisms can all be cultured either from spores or gemmae to provide plants with and without fungal symbionts. This provides a robust approach for enabling quantification of fungal colonization on gametophyte growth, nutrition and reproductive output within a 3 yr project. Our experimental programme will be conducted on (1) mature field-collected populations and (2) symbiotic vs. asymbiotic plants grown from gemmae/spores. Field collected populations will be used for functional studies of C-allocation from liverworts to their fungal partners and reciprocal uptake of nutrients into the plants via the fungi. Populations from gemmae/spores will be used for investigating the net costs/benefits of the fungal symbionts on the growth and reproductive output of the liverworts and the biomass and extent of the fungal partners. Molecular identification and ultra-structural studies will be undertaken on both sets of plants to establish the identity of the fungal endosymbionts, the nature of the plant-fungal interfaces, and how these relate to function and host specificity. Overall, this project will contribute fundamental knowledge and understanding to the dawn of an ancient symbiosis between land plants and fungi that played a founding role in the evolution of terrestrial ecosystems - a topic closely aligned to NERC's Earth System Science Theme high-level challenge &amp;quot;improving current knowledge of the interaction between the evolution of life and the Earth&amp;quot;.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit beyond other academics ?

(1) 'Next generation of reseachers' in schools
(2) General public
(3) Key stakeholders from the industrial sector

We have identified 5 specific activities pathways for reaching these groups:

(1) Dedicated Website written in clear easily accessible language. The website will serve as a link to the institution websites of the PI (APS) and Co-Is (Kew Gardens and the Natural History Museum) and to other websites that discuss plant evolution. It will be regularly updated with postings describing new findings and forthcoming publications.
(2) Outreach activities in schools. We will engage the 'next generation' of researchers by undertaking visits to local schools in Sheffield and London and by hosting year 10 work experience placements. These visits will consist of talks and practical workshops to engage the students in discussions about symbiosis between organisms and its role in plant evolution throughout Earth's history.
(3) Summer Internships. We routinely host Sixth Form students in our labs to provide potential scientists with direct experience in the scientific approach and methodology, and to illustrate what it is like to work in a research environment. We propose to host two such students (3 weeks each) over the duration of the project in Sheffield, Kew and the Natural History Museum, London. 
(4) Outreach activities to the general public. The Natural History Museum and Royal Botanic Gardens-Kew (RBG) in London are world-leaders in public engagement in science. The NHM, which includes the &amp;pound;78 million landmark development of the Darwin Centre 2 (DC2), offers a unique and ideal platform for engaging with the public in a variety of ways. These include its Internet presence and opportunities to give talks to visitors in the David Attenborough Studio (within DC2), as part of the 'Nature Live Events'. We plan to include a specific 'Nature Live Event' on &amp;quot;A 400-million year-old symbiotic relationship: plants and fugi&amp;quot;. RBG-Kew has an Evolution house with &amp;gt;1 million visitors a year. We are in discussions with key people to set-up a semi-permanent display for visitors there about the role of symbiotic fungi in land plant evolution. We plan to exploit these facilities further to communicate our science to the public by giving special lectures at 'Greening of the Earth' Road shows in addition to key museums and botanical gardens in England, Scotland and Wales. At each event, the PDRA will deliver an engaging talk highlighting the 'big science' question being addressed by the project and its wider relevance to society.
The PDRA and 1 PI/CoI will then participate in pre-arranged open discussion sessions. Flyers describing the aims and 'big science' question of the project will be distributed. We will liaise with the following organizations to organize the associated lecture and other activities. Key personnel from each organization have been contacted and are excited about the possibility of hosting these events.
(5) Industry forum. We will demonstrate the potential applications of our data and materials archives via an open day at Sheffield aimed at industry representatives. The PI/Co-I's have been involved in the highly successful 'Multi Functional Landscapes forum' held in Sheffield in 2010 with aimed to engage key stakeholders from industry policy. We will use our extensive network of industrial collaborators to invite key stakeholders (e.g. Corus-TATA steel, RAGT Seeds, Lindham Turf, Bonningale Nurseries) to the forum.

Milestones and measures of success. Key milestones will be: 1) public understanding of science engagement events (schools/Museums); 2) staging of an industry forum event in the final year; 3) creation of an interactive website. Components (1) and (2) will be evaluated via post-presentation feedback. Component (3) will be assessed by counting website hits.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>62579</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Natural History Museum</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Parasites and Vectors</gtr:department><gtr:description>Bio-strategies of mineral nutrient extraction from silicates by selected microorganisms; Horizon 2020</gtr:description><gtr:id>9358C1E4-851A-4633-AD16-9BE00B02557E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Oral presentation 'EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION OF MINERAL CONTROL ON THE MICROBIAL MODE OF ATTACK ON MINERAL SURFACES FOR THE OBTENTION OF INORGANIC NUTRIENTS' at the International Clay Conference, Spain, 2017</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c28549140a99.33556365-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The outcomes of this project will increase understanding of plant, microbes and mineral interactions, which is highly pertinent to my research on the origin and evolution of plant-fungus associations</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Trained MC Research Fellow in in-vitro cultivation of bryophytes and fungi</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Natural History Museum</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>The evolution of fungal associations in land plants</gtr:description><gtr:id>E8B84D9D-78F7-40B6-97D9-C994CB6757A3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Journal article: Fungal associations in Horneophyton ligneri from the Rhynie Chert (c. 407 million year old) closely resemble those in extant lower land plants: novel insights into ancestral plant-fungus symbioses</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>b9db9584b9db9598-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>S Pressel and JG Duckett provided comprehensive data on the extant plants</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Our extensive morphological work as part of this grant, on both extant lower land plants and their associated fungi led to a reappraisal of the nature of fungal associations in Devonian fossil plants.

We have developed for the first time robust protocols for the isolation and in vitro cultivation of symbiotic Mucoromycotina fungi and at the same time established in vitro stocks of the host liverworts. Using these we have fulfilled Koch's postulates. Our comparative cytological studies (light microscopy, transmission and scanning electron microscopy) have revealed profound fungus-induced morphogenetic changes in the liverwort host. Isotope tracer experiments under ambient and elevated CO2 regimes have shown for the first time that these associations are mutualistic but differ functionally from those with Glomeromycota fungi. These key findings indicate that the ancestral land plant-fungus associations were far more diverse than hitherto assumed and involved more than one group of fungi. Extensive sequencing studies are now revealing that Mucoromycotina associations are widespread in both simple and complex thalloid liverworts, hornworts and also lycopods and ferns. In many cases Mucoromycotina form dual partnerships involving also members of the Glomeromycota. We have also shown the existence of dual partnerships in Devonian vascular plants.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The ability to form symbiotic associations with fungi - whereby the fungus provides the plant host with water and nutrients in exchange for photosynthate, is considered one of the key innovations of land plants that drove plant terrestrialization some 490MA. Approximately 90% of extant land plants, including many important crop species, form associations with fungi. Understanding the evolution of these important symbioses and how these associations involving different fungi might shift, because more beneficial to the host, under different atmospheric [CO2] scenarios can have, in the longer term, major agricultural and horticultural implications e.g. introducing different fungal symbionts in crop plants which are more beneficial to the host under a particular environmental scenario. Latest key evidence by members of the project team showing that 1) Mucoromycotina associations differ in their responses to CO2 concentrations from those with Glomeromycota; 2) earliest divergent lineages of vascular plants, the lycopods, also harbour Mucoromycotina fungi; 3) a wide range of lower land plants form dual symbioses with both Mucoromycotina and Glomeromycota; 4) dual symbioses occurred in primitive land plants e.g. the Devonian plant Horneophyton ligneri - now invite future functional, molecular and structural studies. These will determine the nature and ecological significance of dual symbioses, why Mucoromycotina appear to be rare in derived vascular plant lineages and how these early land plant-fungus symbioses respond to climatic change. Thus, members of the research team together with prospective future collaborators are planning further grant applications to carry out these studies plus investigations into the mechanistics of nutrient exchanges and their genetic basis.
