environmentally unfriendly and expensive heavy metal oxidants. An alternative that is often used on gram-scale is to use
ozone, although the risks inherent with scaling up such a process (thermal instability of the reaction intermediates leading
to highly exothermic decomposition) have rendered this approach unscalable. This project will deliver a safe, scalable, lowinventory
method of performing kilo-scale ozonolysis in a continuous manner, and demonstrate its utility via application to
an existing drug compound. Additionally, by using a fully sustainable starting material (ozone is generated in-situ from
oxygen in the air), we will demonstrate a sustainable approach with significant reductions in carbon dioxide emissions.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-12-24</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-06-24</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>95044</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The main objective was to undertake a number of theoretical-computational studies with the ultimate aim to understand fundamentally the interplay between hydrodynamics, reaction and heat-mass transport in micro-reactor and micro-separator devices. So far we have been looking at a simple prototype for such devices, a microchannel with an air-liquid meniscus advancing into it. This problem is being modelled using a simple diffuse interface/Cahn-Hilliard model. More complicated scenarios, e.g. flows in strongly perforated domains will be addressed using the effective macroscopic Canh-Hilliard equations we have obtained in another project.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>As mentioned earlier this is fundamental research, however, there are potential applications as the flows considered in the project are often encountered in a wide variety of technological applications and natural phenomena, e.g. flows in packed-bed reactors, part of the general class of flows in porous media, which in turn are relevant to a wide variety of natural settings, from underground reservoirs to the human body.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0FEE7131-5710-4700-9DCF-765DEFBE9233</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545b983d15d8f5.39315769</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.imperial.ac.uk/complex-multiscale-systems</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The research facilitated by this project has formed the precursor for the development of state-of-the-art rigorous numerical methodologies with the capability of providing accurate and reliable multiscale simulations of complex reactive fluid flows in a wide variety of settings.

As already noted, the research facilitated by this project formed the basis for the development of state-of-the-art rigorous numerical methodologies with the capability of providing accurate and reliable multiscale simulations of complex reactive fluid flows in a wide variety of settings. These computational tools should be of benefit to the control and optimisation of microscale industrial processes and devices that exploit microscale flows of complex fluids as they would allow their rapid design and also designer surfaces for targeted microfluidic applications. High-quality software is a pre-requisite to economic impact and invaluable platform to interact with end users, even at the basic research stage.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c1228b9c3fe7.60013074</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Developme of numerical methodologies for multiphase flows in microengineered devices (MED)</gtr:title><gtr:type>Computer model/algorithm</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.imperial.ac.uk/complex-multiscale-systems</gtr:url></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>We considered as a simple model system a typical MED which can be found in a micro-scale fluid separation system.
