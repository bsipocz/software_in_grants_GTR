These result in a variety of ecological, social, cultural, political and economic changes which affect the ability of food systems to grow food sustainably and distribute it fairly. These challenges have been discussed in a range of scholarly fields and have also been addressed by a range of policy frameworks, political institutions, civil society organisations, corporations and popular social movements. However, there is very little consensus on what sustainable agriculture entails and how to design just and resilient food systems. Three key bodies of academic literature, however, are converging around the idea that sustainability, justice and resilience are, first, interlinked and, second, that they all emerge from democratic food systems in which producers and consumers can exercise autonomy over the choices they make. Our series of workshops will bring together academics, policymakers and representatives of the private and third sectors, along with input from members of the general public, to advance understanding of what sustainable, resilient and just agri-food systems look like in the UK, Brazil and India, which together represent important exemplars of food-system challenges.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The workshop series will benefit a range of non-academic audiences, including policy-makers, public and third sector organisations and the wider public.

Beneficiaries within the sphere of policy and decision-making will include international, regional and national bodies. These include the World Bank, the World Health Organisation, the Food and Agriculture Organisation, UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights to Food, the World Economic Forum, the United Nations Environment Programme and the United Nations Development Programme. In the UK, the work of the proposed network would inform the interests of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Department of Health, the Food Standards Agency and the Department of International Development. In Brazil, beneficiaries include the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Food Supply; the Ministry of Agrarian Development, the Ministry of Social Development and Combating Hunger and the Ministry of Environment. In India, governmental beneficiaries would include the Government's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, the Indian Council of Agricultural Research and the Department of Agriculture and Cooperation. 

A number of public and third-sector organisations in each country would also benefit. In the UK, these would include, amongst others, the Transition Research Network and specifically its interests in alternative food systems, the UK Food Sovereignty Movement, the Research Council UK's Global Food Security programme, the World Development Movement, Friends of the Earth, Nourish Scotland, the Plunkett Foundation, Sustain, the Soil Association, the National Farmers Union and the Campaign to Protect Rural England. In Brazil, beneficiaries would include the FIAN Brazil, National Agriculture Confederation, the National Federation of Workers in Family Agriculture, the National Agroecology Articulation, the Sustainable Agriculture Network, the Brazilian Agroecology Association, the Association of National Agriculture Producers (Sao Paolo), the Ecology Centre (Rio Grande do Sul) and the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Embrapa). In India, beneficiary organisations include, among others, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture, the Centre for Rural Operations Programmes Society, FIAN India and the Centre for Environment and Society.

Outside these institutional settings, the issues of food security, food justice and sustainable agri-food systems are of direct concern to members of the general public on both opposite ends of the food chain - i.e., farmers and consumers. While these beneficiaries will be reached through the above-named civil society organisations, we are also committed to reaching them in their capacity as individual stakeholders. To do so, we will initiate and actively facilitate a two-way communication with the most direct stakeholders in sustainable, just and resilient agri-food systems. 

How will they benefit? 
The above-named beneficiaries and groups of academic and non-academic beneficiaries will benefit from the series in a number of ways. The series will offer a forum in which to deliberate on the key contradictions and tensions within the academic and grey literature on agri-food systems. This will bring substantial clarity by offering us a chance to map the theoretical field on agri-food system sustainability and justice, identify overlaps and gaps and contribute to the development of a synthetic understanding of what just, resilient and productive agri-food systems look like. The series will build a forum in which mixed and conflicting agendas for productivity, resilience and justice can be deliberated in an open way.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>30267</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>We recorded presentations and presentation materials, and shared them on our website.</gtr:description><gtr:id>FF6D7C82-9949-40CD-BC5C-8355C703931F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>These video recordings and slides provided legacy for the seminar series and improved its impact on both academic and non-academic audience.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e169b99f5876.14424448</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Video Recordings and Slides - ESRC Seminar #3</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://foodresearch.org.uk/the-politics-of-food-and-nutrition/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>We created a website to share seminar videos and presentation slides as well as the seminar programme and related information.</gtr:description><gtr:id>7DF578F7-05A9-46AF-A3A0-A2CF3861D105</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This website provided legacy for the seminar series and improved its impact on both academic and non-academic audience.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e167bd46d564.94137689</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Website</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artefact (including digital)</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://foodresearch.org.uk/the-future-of-our-food/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>We recorded presentations and panel discussion session and shared them on our website.</gtr:description><gtr:id>4DBC7F8B-D9C8-4D56-A16E-4FB4CAD53A7C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>These video recordings provided legacy for the seminar series and improved its impact on both academic and non-academic audience.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e168a724b043.11128911</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Video recordings - ESRC Seminar #1</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://foodresearch.org.uk/the-fruits-of-our-labour/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>We recorded presentations, panel discussion and presentation materials, and shared them on our website.</gtr:description><gtr:id>D16BE01B-08D8-49A5-82B9-2645690FB015</gtr:id><gtr:impact>These video recordings and slides provided legacy for the seminar series and improved its impact on both academic and non-academic audience.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e16a513fa324.33461845</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Video Recordings and Slides - ESRC Seminar #4</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://foodresearch.org.uk/food-and-corporations/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>ESRC Seminar #2: Sustainable Places for Food Security</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B09085CC-7B9C-4781-A235-6684BA81B335</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This seminar brought together academics and civil society organisations to explore how different places shape food systems, and how they have sought to meet current challenges.

It also sought to understand new forms of labour and labour structures that are emerging as a response to the problems faced by the agri-food system and how far they might go towards addressing them. A keynote speaker from Brazil was presented, who delivered a very insightful presentation on the realities of fruit production in the northeast of Brazil.

Civil society organisations (CSOs) spend much time and energy trying to influence and sometimes confront huge corporations which dominate the UK, EU and global food systems. Support from academics to CSOs in this work is patchy. On some issues - obesity, food products, safety - there is a tradition of academic-NGO liaison, but on wages or conditions, there is less. This seminar was a chance to consider what is going on in the corporate food world and the nature of food corporate power. A range of policymakers, food practitioners, academics and CSO representatives presented their views on the role of corporate power in the global food system, also engaging in alternative food governance systems.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e147e113aec2.83537974</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://foodresearch.org.uk/food-and-corporations/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>We partnered with the Food Research Collaboration (FRC, http://foodresearch.org.uk/) to enhance long-lasting impact of the project on non-academic stakeholders.

Benefiting from the experiences of international academics from India and Brazil, the seminar series provided an international context for the UK and global food system. The following main events were organised: 

Workshop for Collaboration on &amp;quot;Future of our Food&amp;quot;, 28 April 2014 , City University London, involving 27 Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) and 20 academics working on food related issues in the UK

&amp;quot;The Fruits of Our Labour: Work, labour and the political economy of our food system&amp;quot;, 29 October 2014, University of Essex, 8 presented papers, 25 academic and non-academic participants. 

&amp;quot;Sustainable Places for Food Security: Critical Reflections and International Comparisons&amp;quot;, 19 November 2014, Cardiff University, 7 presented papers, 30 academic and non-academic participants. 

&amp;quot;The Politics of Food and Nutrition: Resilience, Security and Justice in a Global Context&amp;quot;, 4 February 2015, University of Edinburgh, 9 presented papers, 40 academic and non-academic participants. 

&amp;quot;Food and Corporations&amp;quot;, 30 March 2015, City University London, 11 presented papers, 50 academic and non-academic participants. 

Core Achievements

We partnered with the Food Research Collaboration (FRC) initiative to enhance long-lasting impact of the project on non-academic stakeholders. The FRC is an inter-disciplinary, inter-University, inter-civil society collaboration that facilitates joint working by academics and non-academics to improve the UK food system, to encourage research that meets civil society needs, to share food evidence and thinking to improve coherence and &amp;quot;voice&amp;quot;, to encourage longer-lasting collaborations between and within academic and non-academic collaborators, including civil society organisations, policymakers and practitioners.

The project has led to some specific academic outputs. First, some of the research papers presented during the seminar series were submitted to and accepted by the journal Organization for a special issue on 'Work and Labour issues in the Global Food System'. Additionally, short articles and policy briefs that aim particularly non-academic audience are in the process of being issued. Finally, further research funding was obtained for the project &amp;quot;Agroecological Business&amp;quot;, comprising key participants in this ESRC seminar series.

Another important achievement of the project is its contribution to the understanding and highlighting potentials and problems of the food system in the UK in a global context. By inviting international academics from Brazil and India to the seminar series and discussing, comparing, examining and exploring the UK food system within its global context, the project not only improved its long-lasting impact but also brought missing insights from the realities of global food supply chains into focus.

Finally, to provide legacy for the seminar series and to improve its impact on both academic and non-academic audience, the project utilised various online platforms. The presentations during the seminar sessions were recorded and shared both on the FRC's website and a dedicated YouTube channel. Additionally, the presentation slides were also captured and visually shared on the website.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This seminar series has involved a large number of academic (about 100) and non-academic (about 50) users and participants. By collaborating with the Food Research Collaboration, we contributed to setting up a lasting platform for civil society actors, policymakers, practitioners as well as academics active in the food system to collaborate with each other. 

On the FRC's website we have made all presentations available for anybody to use free of charge. This provides an accessible legacy of the seminar series which will be of use to academic and non-academic users working not only in the food system but also in public health, policy, environment, democracy and justice. 

We are currently preparing a range of policy briefs and short articles in The Conversation, which will further enhance the impact of the seminar series. Some 10 key participants have volunteered to write these short reports and articles, engaging with a variety of issues to do with the global realities of the food system, which will be published during 2016. 

Given the accessibility of our material on the internet, we expect a global reach of our findings, particularly in Brazil and India, which were focal points of our collaboration.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>F0B3DF47-B51F-49FE-B446-7F4EEE9D463B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e127538952a2.73760860</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Environment,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice,Retail</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://foodresearch.org.uk/the-future-of-our-food/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/L001594/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5B25B6A3-B218-4F11-8A9D-661236DF455C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agri-environmental science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Climate &amp; Climate Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>794345CD-A1D5-4984-ADDD-088BCF41822F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agricultural systems</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Climate &amp; Climate Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6BFE597D-D128-481A-A949-5847F619966F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environment</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F6DEB3C9-18A0-4A06-87C5-8C347DF98C60</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environmental Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>78369800-A95E-49BC-94E7-8659E5C2EFEF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Geography and Development</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
