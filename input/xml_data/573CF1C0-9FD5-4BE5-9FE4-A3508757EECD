The remit of the project was to cover the whole island of Ireland, not simply what became Northern Ireland after 1921, and to produce at least one story for each of the 32 counties in Ireland. The academic contribution consisted of (1) suggesting and researching stories (2) recording on selected programmes (3) checking the factual content of programmes and recommending strategies for re-editing or contextual elaboration where required (4) contributing to and checking the BBC website accompanying text. The academic contributors were also concerned to ensure Ireland's distinctive presence (as it was a part of the UK in 1914-18) in the overall 'World War One at Home' project, but also to uncover and highlight the particular political tensions concerning Irish involvement both before and after the 1916 Easter Rising, tensions which differentiate the Irish experience from that of other parts of the UK. The creation of a database of stories about WWI in Ireland has also been informed by the specific social resonances of commemoration in the context of Northern Irish recent history, and with recognition that the 1914-18 centenary should be handled with a sensitivity towards diversity of cultural expression and experience. The partnership between Brearton (PI) and Coleman (CI) was also unique in the 'WWI at Home' context, in being a collaboration between a historian and literary critic, thereby shaping in distinctive ways the stories suggested across Irish cultural, political and military history.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Arklow: The Kynoch Explosives factory</gtr:description><gtr:form>A broadcast e.g. TV/radio/film/podcast (other than news/press)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CD93E8B9-20A6-4E67-AF65-E3162821FF32</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Archival research for and suggested editorial changes to a story to correct potential factual errors in a radio documentary for BBC Radio Ulster on the causes of an explosion at the Kynoch munitions factory in Arklow during the First World War.

As well as providing research material for stories, Brearton and Coleman worked with in-house BBC researchers advising them on how to locate appropriate sources for the broadcast material and to develop new areas of exploration. Michael Tumelty - Editor, Factual, of BBC Radio Ulster highlighted the importance of the AHRC-funded researchers saying they 'have been indispensable to ensuring the success and rigour of this flagship BBC project' (see AHRC annual impact report 2014-15 p.36).
The broadcasts, in turn, shape and/or revise understanding of the events of the Great War, particularly as they affected Irish people and places. The political complexities of Irish involvement in the Great War have posed particular challenges for the project in Northern Ireland and memory of the First World War remains a politically sensitive issue. The stories generated have explored often divisive aspects of what is nevertheless a shared history. By focussing on individual lives and local places the broadcasts serve to develop, for a wide audience, knowledge of the past, and to build cross-community understanding - to the political, cultural and educational enrichment of society. and in keeping with the NI Executive strategy, which recognises that 'the events of our past will inevitably have economic and social impacts for us now and the way in which these events are marked will also have a significant influence on our continued journey towards a united community'.</gtr:description><gtr:id>98FEF483-0036-4A57-8C12-CC3DA5B10242</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d5afcdd39380.31482076</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Broadcasts by BBC Radio Ulster archived in perpetuity on the BBC World War One at Home website.</gtr:description><gtr:id>BE1D7FE6-6889-4600-8F09-820698AC7E58</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The broadcasts provide an educational resource for future study of the First World War in Ireland as well as serving to inform the general public about aspects of a contested history.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dd63f6e99bd3.84407272</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>BBC Radio Ulster WWI at Home website</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01p33l4</gtr:url></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/M504051/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
