The aim of this project is to elucidate the molecular structure and mechanism of the family of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, which are amongst the most important GPCRs found in the brain, being important in both memory and cognition. We are developing a detailed understanding of how the receptors are activated, and of how drugs interact with them to block or promote signalling. We are using structural insights to develop novel pharmaceuticals targetted at muscarinic subtypes. These may be of value in treating cognitive disorders, and psychoses arising from diseases, such as Alzheimers, which are characterised by reduced levels of acetylcholine in the brain.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>G- protein-coupled 7-transmembrane receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family of transmembrane signalling proteins in the mammalian genome. The aim of this project is to elucidate the molecular structure and mechanism of the family of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs), which are amongst the most important GPCRs found in the brain, and are the target of the peripheral parasympathetic actions of acetylcholine. There are 5 genetic subtypes of mAChRs, each having a characteristic distribution. Between them, they alter the activity of a large proportion of the neurons in the central nervous system, producing effects which are important in both memory and cognition, as well as regulating smooth muscle contraction, glandular secretion, and the heart rate. We aim to understand, in atomic detail, how the mAChRs are activated, and how drugs interact with them to block or promote signalling. There are two objectives of the research. The first is to determine the three-dimensional structure of the major subtype of mAChRs found in the brain, the M1 mAChR, and to define the important contacts of the receptor molecule with agonists, antagonists, and G-proteins. The second is to translate these structural insights into the development of novel pharmacological agents targetted at individual muscarinic subtypes. We are taking two complementary approaches to the stuctural questions. The first is to undertake determination of the three-dimensional structure of the receptor by electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography. Using techniques of molecular biology and protein engineering, we have isolated milligramme quantities of M1 mAChRs. We are attempting to crystallize the receptor protein (with Dr. Lesley Haire, Division of Molecular Structure, NIMR). We are also actively investigating the ability of the M1 mAChR to form dimeric and higher oligomeric structures that may influence its ability to signal. The second approach involves the construction of point mutants of the receptor, which are then expressed in a mammalian cell lines, and analysed by in-vitro radioligand binding studies, and the measurement of signal transduction. Combining the resulting data enables us to determine the effects of particular mutations on ligand binding affinity, and signalling efficacy. We have identified the amino acids which are important for the binding of acetylcholine, as well as certain high-affinity muscarinic antagonists. In addition, we have identified networks of intramolecular contacts which participate in the activation of the receptor. These results have been incorporated into a molecular model of the M1 mAChR, based on the recently-solved structure of the photoreceptor, rhodopsin. The library of mutants which we have constructed is proving to be an important resource for the analysis of novel receptor interactions, and we have initiated a collaboration with GlaxoSmith-Kline to use them to define the binding site(s) of novel compounds that activate the M1 mAChR from a site distinct from the acetylcholine binding pocket.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>1974-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1836505</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Global</gtr:country><gtr:description>GSK:NIMR 1 year collaborative research agreement</gtr:description><gtr:id>FC58379C-68AC-4B77-AA65-8294A5110606</gtr:id><gtr:impact>1 year collaboration agreement to fund post-doctoral research assistant to investigate mode of action of novel selective agonists of M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. The agreement terminated in December 2007 but analysis and discussion of the results and writing of the manuscript extended into 2008. This work had a successful outcome in defining a novel mode of binding for the agonists that were studied, different from that of acetylcholine. A full paper based on the non-confidential parts of the work was published in February 2009 (PMID 19001633). This work has relevance for the design of selective muscarinic agonists for the treatment of Alzheimers and schizophrenia, and for the determination of the structure of muscarinic receptor-agonist complexes. This project required collaboration between experimental pharmacologists and molecular modellers.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>F652D3028D4-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Discussing and agreeing the amino acids in the M1 mAChR that were targeted in the two phases of the project.

After funding was agreed, I planned the project in detail with colleagues at GSK, specifically Dr. Chris Langmead. After advertising the post, I carried out an initial candidate selection. Following interviews, Dr. Langmead and I recruited a suitable candidate, Dr. Lebon. Dr. Lebon was trained in the necessary techniques in my laboratory, and I supervised all of the experimental research programme. I set up regular presentation meetings with Dr. Langmead and other colleagues at GSK, analysed data, ensured the writing of reports, and wrote and submitted the published manuscript in collaboration with Dr. Lebon, and my colleagues at GSK.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2006-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Heptares Therapeutics Ltd</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Stabilization of M1 muscarinic receptors</gtr:description><gtr:id>9A5F436B-A59D-41B3-AF2F-23E5922078F6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The expertise of Heptares is in the production of mutagenically- stabilised G-protein coupled receptors for structural studies, particularly X-ray crystallography. This approach was mainly developed by my collaborators at LMB, with whom I have had a long-standing relationship because of their pioneering work on GPCR structure. I have continued to work in this field, on the over-expression, purification and stabilisation of M1 muscarinic receptors and their complexes. The M1 mAChR is an important therapeutic target and this work is directly relevant to the programme of Heptares. So far information from my project has contributed to a patent published by Heptares entitled &amp;quot;Mutant proteins and methods for selecting them: In-situ destabilisation (2009)&amp;quot;. It has become apparent that stabilised receptors (StaRs) have multiple uses in mapping ligand binding sites (Biophysical MappingTM), fragment screening and drug screening programmes, and as antigens for potentially therapeutic antibodies. Information provided by the company has complemented my own project, and information provided by my work has helped to facilitate their progress. Heptares scientists have have now used StaR technology to determine crystal structures for several GPCRs that are validated clinical targets. They include the A2A adenosine (Parkinsons), orexin 1 (addiction), CRF-1 (the first family B GPCR; depression and anxiety), mGluR5 transmembrane domain (the first family C GPCR; autism and dyskinesia) and the M1 mAChR complexed with novel selective agonists (cognitive defects in Alzheimers and Schizophrenia), the latter based on and extending the mutagenic mapping study published by my laboratory in 2009. A particular outcome has been the development of a first in class selective M1 muscarinic agonist. This has now completed phase 1 clinical trials. A back-up molecule is also undergoing Phase 1 clinical trials. M4 and M1/M4 agonists are also under development (psychosis and cognitive impairment in Schizophrenia. These and other Heptares drug development programs have the potential to make a very significant contribution to the UK economy.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>E8F39251595-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Exchange of information influencing work on M1 mAChRs in my laboratory and at Heptares. Mutagenesis, receptor expression and crystallographic structure determination.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Heptares Therapeutics is a company started by MRC scientists at LMB and NIMR which aims to determine the structures and exploit the biophysical properties of G protein-coupled receptors to facilitate drug discovery, through the exploitation of its proprietary StaR receptor stabilisation technology. The MRC was a significant shareholder in Heptares, which in turn has first claim on any IP generated by MRC scientists in the field of GPCR structure and stabilisation. My signature of the consultancy agreement in 2007 was instrumental in allowing Heptares to obtain seed funding of ca. &amp;pound;1,000,000 which enabled it to start up on the MRCT site at Mill Hill. Information provided my laboratory has contributed to patents held by Heptares. This helped the company to obtain &amp;pound;21,000,000 series A equity funding from international venture capital firms in February 2009. This enabled it to move its operation to the BioPark in Welwyn Garden City, where it now deploys a full range of receptor structural techniques, and has ca. 65 full time employees. Heptares has established collaborations with Shire Pharmaceuticals, Takeda, the Novartis Option Fund, AstraZeneca, Medimmune, Morphosys, TEVA, Pfizer, Medimmune and Cubist Pharmaceticals, with a potential worth of up to $670,000,000. My project was directly relevant to the aims of the company, and our interests are complementary. I was a member of the SAB of Heptares from 2007 to 2014 and provided regular advice about directions. My expertise in the field of muscarinic receptors was regarded as valuable to Heptares, and the work that my group has done, including my collaboration with GSK, has been of direct relevance in developing their programme. I provided direct advice to the team developing selective muscarinic agonists.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2007-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>60000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>Global</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>GSK:NIMR Collaborative research award</gtr:description><gtr:end>2007-12-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>D815FFAE-085C-4745-8855-42AC8DEE929B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>9A269E7F2FE0</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2006-12-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput><gtr:description>A method for the assessment of the stability of a native or mutant receptor protein in its native environment by the addition of a calibrated concentration of a destabilising agent.</gtr:description><gtr:grantRef>MC_U117532184</gtr:grantRef><gtr:id>DEE87B97-3B92-40D9-95E0-938D8CDFA9A9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This method enables the application of Heptares Therapeutics StaRTM technology to GPCRs and other receptors and drug targets whose initial stability is too low to permit their full solubilisation during the selection of stabilised mutants.

In 2011, structures of the A2A adenosine receptor both complexed with antagonists, and, for the first time for any GPCR, with the endogenous agonist were also solved, the latter by my ex post-doc, Guillaume Lebon. Arising from the A2A work, a best-in-class selective antagonist has been developed that has been licensed to Shire pharmaceuticals. StarTM technology has so far proved to be generically applicable to GPCRs, and is causing much excitement within the pharmaceutical industry and the wider GPCR community. More than 7 other GPCRs are in the StaR pipeline. Successful applications of StarTM technology in 2012-2015 have included the Orexin-1 receptor, the M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor complexed with novel selective agonists, the corticotrophin releasing factor 1 receptor and the transmembrane domain of the mGluR5 receptor. Heptares scientists have confirmed the novel mode of interaction of selective agonists of the M1 muscarinic receptor first proposed as a result of work in my laboratory. These structures are feeding into the development of novel drug candidates directed at these and related receptors for a number of important clinical situations including type 2 diabetes, migraine, addiction and compulsive disorders, chronic insomnia, anxiety and depression, autism and cognitive enhancement. In February 2016, Heptares reported a successful phase 1b clinical trial of a first-in-class selective M1 mAChR agonist designed to enhance cognition in dementia and schizophrenia, devoid of parasympathetic side effects.
