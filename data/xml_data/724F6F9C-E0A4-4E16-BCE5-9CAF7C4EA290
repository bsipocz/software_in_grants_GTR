In particular, SRAM-based FPGAs, are extremely suitable for high-performance image processing as they can implement complex algorithms as parallel structures and can in this way speed up significantly their execution. The output of this feasibility study will be a prototype of a crop management image processing hardware accelerator which will be implemented as a plug-in module to a laptop in the form of a USB-enabled printed circuit board, containing an FPGA-based processing system and interface components. The module will be controlled through a user interface on the laptop screen. The ultimate aim beyond the feasibility study is to develop a handheld product which can be supplied as part of a contract to farmers and agronomists. 

The key activities for the feasibility study will be (i) to identify the most appropriate source of FPGA which is adaptable to the requirements (ii) to develop programmes that are adaptable to a range of satellite images and other data. The product will need to be designed to process all types of satellite imagery using standard algorithms such as NDVI and also indexes and algorithms based on validated research. SPOT imagery at 5-10 m (multispectral data) is typically the basis for recommendations made by Precise Crop Nutrition at present. Other satellite data, including Radar, which can help to overcome limitations due to cloud cover will be tested as part of the feasibility study. This will include historic satellite data held by NERC and other facilities to demonstrate management zone mapping where there is a relationship to soil types. (iii) To evaluate the practicality of the selected prototype system in the field compared with centrally provided data as used currently (iv)To establish the acceptability of the system with agronomists and farmers. This will involve obtaining feedback from existing users of the N-Map service and those less familiar with variable N. (v) Preparing a full report on the outcome of the feasibility study with recommendations for further development.
Steps (i) and (ii) will be executed by Leicester University - over quarters one and two (with input from Precise Crop Nutrition, on the selection of satellite images and input of required field data. Step (iii) will be carried out by Precise Crop Nutrition , quarter two and three. Step (iv) will be carried out by Precise Crop Nutrition, quarter three and four. The whole group will contribute to step (v), quarter four.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The successful development of the system will be the launch pad for a viable, stand-alone business offering economic growth and employment. Farmer users have already demonstrated the economic benefits (yield or reduced N input) from the application of the N-Map service. The application of the handheld system on farm will transform the uptake bringing the benefits to a much wider national customer base including, eventually, other agronomy companies.

Variable crop management requires knowledge and training to analyse data and determine management practice. Current systems largely leave control in the hands of the suppliers. The proposed service will offer a wide group of farmers and agronomists, not just the technically orientated few, much more inclusion in the process and through this they will gain confidence in the adoption of future applications. It will mean that independent agronomists and others will not need to have specialist remote sensing knowledge to offer a service using satellite data and they can develop their own knowledge in the product on a farm by farm basis without relying on other companies or sharing their expert knowledge. This is important to the agronomist who relies on his individual expertise to maintain his standing with his clients.

The main benefit will be through greater efficiency in the use of fertiliser leading to reduction in the environmental impacts of food production. The production of nitrogen fertiliser is energetically intensive, consequently production needs to be optimised in order to minimise the emission of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide. If over-applied in parts of a field where it is not needed this can lead to pollution of water courses. Similarly variable application of agrochemicals, such that chemicals are only applied where needed, will reduce water pollution and excessive impact on soil organisms.
This project represents a great training opportunity for the RA and the students who will be involved in this research project as it is multi-disciplinary in nature with skills in design for hardware/software, real time operating systems, satellite image processing, connectivity, decision making. This rich set of knowledge and experience will increase their employment prospects in multiple sectors such as automotive, space, medical robotics, reliable embedded systems, etc.. Training the RA and students in this key multidisciplinary area will provide highly skilled man power to the UK industry.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>48316</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/P008909/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5B25B6A3-B218-4F11-8A9D-661236DF455C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>5</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agri-environmental science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>60</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
