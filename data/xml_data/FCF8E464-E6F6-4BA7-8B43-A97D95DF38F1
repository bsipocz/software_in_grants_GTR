However, we are rapidly approaching fundamental limits of silicon technology and new materials are required to enable future advances. Considerable research has been carried out on developing metal oxides based on materials such as hafnium (Hf) and rare-earth (RE. Such as Gd, La, Nd &amp;amp; Pr) elements, these oxides could be used to replace the native silicon oxide currently used in microelectronics, allowing further device scaling. In contrast to these oxides, little work has been reported about their nitride counterparts, which is perhaps partly due to the challenge associated with their production using conventional-chemistry or thin-film techniques. However, Hf- and RE- nitrides display a wide range of useful electronic and magnetic properties, which are potentially exploitable in a variety of electronic, spintronic and optoelectronic devices. In conventional electronic integrated circuits, nitrides could be used alongside their oxide counterparts, acting as diffusion barriers, nucleation layers or electrical contacts. While in advanced spintronic devices, their magnetic properties could be exploited to enable the production of transistors that operate using the quantum properties of electrons; opening up a new era in computing. In this project, Hf and RE -nitrides will be investigated, using atomic layer deposition (ALD) to produce nitride thin films, and a range of advanced characterisation techniques to study their structural and electrical properties. The ALD process involves exposing a heated surface (usually silicon) to alternating pulses of two complementary precursor gases; one of these is a metal-containing molecule and the other a reactant (such as water or ammonia for oxide or nitride deposition respectively). The precursors are absorbed onto the surface and undergo chemical reactions with the previously absorbed surface molecules, by-products of the reactions are carried away from the surface by a vacuum system leaving a pure oxide, nitride or metal film on the surface. To avoid gas phase reactions between the active gases, inert gas purges are introduced between exposures. As the deposition surface can only accommodate a limited number or precursor molecules, ALD growth is self-limiting, which means that each pair of precursor pulses deposits about one layer of atoms. As a result, ALD allows a very high level of control over films thickness and also produces extremely uniform films (even on high-aspect ratio etched structures), which are essential for advanced microelectronic devices. A number of transition metal-nitrides, most notably titanium and tungsten, have been successfully deposited by ALD. In the first part of this project we will investigate the ALD and properties of Hf-nitride, this material is of technological significance as it complements Hf-oxide, which is expected to be a key material in the production of integrated circuits in the near future. In the second part of this project, we will investigate a number of RE-nitrides, these are expected to have a wide and continuous range of useful electronic and magnetic properties. This ambitious multidisciplinary project will seek to develop a reliable thin film deposition method, which is readily scalable to mass production manufacturing. It will also seek to gain a greater understanding of the physical and electronic properties of these unusual materials.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>208072</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Singapore, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with IMRE, A*Star, Singapore</gtr:description><gtr:id>183D9E5C-9903-4F73-9BF4-B933D9BA9AD3</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b9d3bddcb9d3bdf0-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>This research resulted in a new collaboration with the Institute of Materials Research and Engineering (IMRE), which is part of A*Star in Singapore.

ALD is a self limiting growth process, which is extremely well suited to the manufacturing of products, such as transistors, that require thin film coatings with sub-nanometre control of thickness, uniformity &amp;amp; conformality on high aspect ratio structures. 



Nitride deposition by ALD is extremely challenging as unwanted oxidation reactions readily compete with nitridation resulting in the formation of oxy-nitrides or even oxides. Sources of oxygen contamination were identified in our proposal and significant effort was invested to eliminate these, despite this, initial Hf-nitride studies were unsuccessful. An unforeseen benefit of this development was the formation of a close collaboration with Oxford Instruments as we jointly developed reactor technology for nitride ALD. The grant was extended by six months to mitigate for the extended development phase &amp;amp; project aims were reviewed. The target for Hf-nitride was replaced with Ta-nitride following this review &amp;amp; consultation with our industrial partner, SAFC Hitech. 



Ta-nitride is of significant interest for a number of applications including CMOS devices: TaN is highly conductive, has good diffusion barrier properties &amp;amp; can be used as a workfunction tuning layer, while Ta3N5 is insulating &amp;amp; has excellent diffusion barrier properties. We have demonstrated ALD of both forms of Ta-nitride using pentakis(dimethylamino)Ta with either ammonia (NH3) to produce TaN, or monomethylhydrazine (MMH) to produce Ta3N5. This is the first time that a thermal ALD process with NH3 has successfully produced highly conductive TaN without the need for an additional reductant. Both processes are self limiting &amp;amp; the transamination-like reactions have been elucidated using quartz crystal microbalance measurements in conjunction with medium energy ion scattering. We presented this work as an invited talk at ALD2010 &amp;amp; a journal article comparing the processes has been published.



A major aim of this project was the growth of lanthanide (Ln) nitrides &amp;amp; Gadolinium (Gd) was selected as an initial target due to its technological potential. GdN is a ferromagnetic semiconductor, which is of interest for injection of spin-polarized carriers in spintronic devices. Ln-nitrides are extremely air sensitive &amp;amp; will readily oxidise in air at room temperature. In the current project, thin cap layers of Ta-nitride were used to protect the films. Thermal ALD was carried out using Tris(methylcyclopentadienyl)Gd with either NH3 or MMH, but this failed to produce GdN due to poor reaction kinetics. To overcome this, plasma-enhanced-ALD was carried out and we successfully deposit GdN films with a Gd:N ratio close to 1:1. By optimising growth conditions, we obtain GdN films with only trace amount of oxygen &amp;amp; carbon incorporation. This study represents the first successful deposition of GdN by ALD. We presented part of this work at Fall MRS2010 &amp;amp; a journal article has been published. 



Further studies were carried out using tris(silylamide)Gd with NH3 &amp;amp; MMH in an attempt to develop a thermal ALD process for GdN. Amide based precursor can react with NH3 or hydrazines via transamination-like reactions &amp;amp; hence, this precursor is more suitable for thermal ALD. The MMH process successfully produced films proving that the reaction kinetics are favourable, however, the resulting films were found to be oxides. The oxygen is believed to originate from tetrahydrofuran used in the precursor synthesis. Further work to purify the precursor could provide a route to GaN. 



In the latter stage of the project, we returned to the Hf-nitride synthesis, which was successfully deposited using both thermal &amp;amp; plasma-enhanced ALD processes. This work was presented at ALD2010.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This research is potentially exploitable by the microelectronics industry for the development of next generation microelectronics. It also has potential applications to the broader manufacturing sector where thin films of transition metal nitrides are of interest for applications such as anti-corrosion, ware-resistance and decorative coatings. The Tantalum nitride ALD research carried out during this project is currently being exploited in developing specialist laser targets and next generation GaN-on-silicon power field effect transistors.
