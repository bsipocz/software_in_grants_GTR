&lt;p>The project uses a mixed methods approach is to improve our understanding of how social capital, economic, and individual factors interact to enhance the wellbeing of older people living in the slums of Nairobi, Kenya. It combines in-depth qualitative research with quantitative analysis of unique panel data of 2,000 older people aged 50 and over living in two Nairobi slums who have been followed over time.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The study seeks to better understand resilience among older people in coping with stresses and shocks, and how some people are able to adapt and to emerge with better health and socio-economic outcomes and overall wellbeing relative to other older people in these communities. It is envisaged that the findings from this study will inform policies and programmes seeking to alleviate poverty and improve the lives of poor people by enhancing their capabilities and resourcefulness in drawing upon existing capital.&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The non-academic audiences who will benefit from this research are international, bilateral and intergovernmental agencies and civil society groups that seek to improve the wellbeing of poor people. The research will also be directly beneficial to government ministries and departments providing social and health services. The findings from this research will inform third sector organizations that are primarily involved with vulnerable and marginalised populations such as slum dwellers and older people by providing evidence-based recommendation to inform their policies and interventions. One such key stakeholder particularly relevant to this study is HelpAge International, whose primary mandate is advocating for the rights of older people nationally and internationally as well as service delivery to improve the wellbeing of older people. HelpAge works directly with older people through targeted initiatives seeking to help older people overcome poverty and improve their wellbeing. It is envisaged that the findings from this study will inform their programs that seek to empower and improve the capacities of older people. This research will raise the profile of older people living in urban areas as a group in need of attention.

At the national level, one of the government agencies targeted as a beneficiary for this research is the National Coordinating Agency for Population and Development of Kenya (NCAPD) whose mandate is to 'provide leadership in formulating, coordinating and implementing appropriate population policies and programmes for sustainable development'. This agency has facilitated a number of social and health programs aimed at targeting the poor and the most vulnerable in society. Therefore, findings from the proposed study would be particularly relevant to NCAPD as it would provide the agency with strategic methodology for classification of the vulnerable people in society and highlight areas to be targeted for interventions in order to strengthen the capacity of individuals to utilize available opportunities and increase their abilities. Another initiative that will benefit directly from findings from this research is the newly introduced cash transfer scheme. The government of Kenya through the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Development has allocated funds in the fiscal budget to be dispersed to destitute older people. Findings from the study will therefore be beneficial to the government of Kenya in the identification of older people who are potentially vulnerable and in highlighting this segment of older people living in urban areas given that the current focus for the cash transfer scheme are older people living in rural areas.

The non-academic beneficiaries mentioned above will be involved throughout the phase of the project and concerted efforts will be put in place to engage with them through various forums. The research findings will be disseminated through a number of channels including consultative meetings with the stakeholders at key stages of the projects. In order to improve on the likelihood of the findings of this research being absorbed by the intended beneficiaries, the stakeholders' communication channels will be utilised. This includes using the existing newsletters and other Information, Education and Communication (IEC) materials which have an already established circulation to disseminate the research findings. Electronic publications of the research findings in the investigators and partners' websites will facilitate easy retrieval by the wider public through popular search engines.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>297763</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Resilence in Later Life in Low Resource Settings, Policy Dissemination Forum, Hilton Hotel, Nairobi, 28 July 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>95D9982F-8DF8-414F-AF6C-0920D3E3CAA1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>On 28 July 2015, a high-level dissemination forum was held at the Hilton Hotel, Nairobi, bringing together around 80 national- and county-level policy makers from relevant sectors, and key representatives from civil society and academia.

Subsequent to the dissemination forum, members of the research team have held a number of meetings with the Kenyan Ministry of Labour, Social Services and Security. The project findings have resulted in a new collaborative research project between the research team and the Kenyan Ministry of Labour, Social Services and Security to investigate the role that old age social pension may play in reducing pension poverty and also in either ameliorating or augmenting intergenerational tensions and divides within families and communities. This ESRC-DFID funded project starts in September 2016 (ES/N014510/1).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>644DE527-F1F3-484D-8AEA-A54CD1BDC1F5</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56e07dc1064e81.27888960</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This study uses a mixed methods approach to better understand resilience among older people. It combines in-depth qualitative research with quantitative analysis of unique longitudinal data of 2,000 older people aged 50 and over living in two Nairobi slums.
The project has generated new knowledge on the nature and experience of resilience in older age on two broad levels. First by providing rare emic (from the perspectives of older persons themselves) understandings of the issue. Second by providing novel insights from non-Western low resource stings, specifically sub-Saharan African. 
The most important specific new empirical insights generated by the study are:
 (i) The major 'adversity' faced by older slum dwellers centres not on the 'multiple losses' (to health, function, social roles and relationships through bereavement) that are considered as key in the Western debate, but rather on three interlinked domains that are not captured in the extant literature, namely a) a perceived inability to meet basic needs at present and to secure their future, b) a perceived lack of prospects for their offspring and c) resultant anxiety and stress.
(ii) A resilience 'resource' for older adults commonly considered key in the Western debate - namely close, supportive friendships and family ties and attendant emotional social support - plays little or no role in supporting the 'coping' of older slum dwellers. Qualitative research highlighted that social relationships are marked by a generalised lack of trust; frequently in the case of spouses or close younger generation kin, by conflict and strain; and a broad lack of rapport with youth within the community. However, older slum residents do draw on other forms of engagement with the social network as key coping resources. This was confirmed in the quantitative analysis, which demonstrated that maintaining or increasing formal local networks reduced the detrimental effects of the post-election violence for older people's wellbeing, whilst household environment and informal local and non-local networks did not influence the relationship.
(iii) Mobility is a pivotal determinant of the extent to which older individuals can pursue such a coping strategy. A further determinant is the extent to which their peers engage in the same coping strategies, highlighting the interdependence of resilience within the slum-dwelling older population
(iv) In a low resource, subsistence setting, older people's level of access to material resources and economic opportunities play a central role in shaping both the level of adversity they experience, and the level of 'coping' they are able to attain. Women have poorer health and socio-economic status and contrasting social networks to men, underscoring the importance of structural inequalities in resilience. 
The findings have opened up important new research questions about what appropriate, effective and gender sensitive policy responses could be designed to enhance older slum dwellers' resilience. In particular, what will:
i) enhance mobility among this population? 
ii) address and bridge intergenerational tensions and divides within families and communities?
iii) enhance the effectiveness and inclusivity of savings groups for older adults?
iv) enhance the scope and reach of old age social protection provision?</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Findings from the study will be beneficial to national and international agencies which seek to reduce vulnerability through improved understanding of both income and non-income components of poverty among the poorest in society. 
During the project, new connections have been forged with key policy role players at national and sub-national levels, who are seeking to build on the findings in advancing their respective strategic agendas. National-level partners include the Kenya Ministry of Health and the Kenya Ministry of Labour, Social Services and Security who are working, respectively, on finalising a national strategy on ageing and health and on the implementation of the Kenya national policy on older persons and ageing. At the sub-national level, the Nairobi county government departments of education, youth and social services are utilising the findings to inform policy design and practice.
In addition, the findings will inform academic scholarship in the field of resilience. The study has highlighted that existing conceptions of later life 'adversity' and 'resilience' in the literature, which are derived overwhelmingly from empirical work in the Global North, are highly context dependent and the nature of salient 'adversities' and resilience resources in such SSA settings is not captured in existing constructs.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>053CDE34-A7A0-4C95-A4AC-B9277309E76C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>565317d202ae36.09551038</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BE02A256-DB0A-4820-97EC-E3F7518449B4</gtr:id><gtr:title>Entry and re-entry into informal care-giving over a 3-year prospective study among older people in Nairobi slums, Kenya.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Health &amp;
