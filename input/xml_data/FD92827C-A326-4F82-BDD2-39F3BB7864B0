Institutionalist and political economy approaches to democratic governance increasingly emphasise the interdependence of ?state? and ?society,? but the reality of these cities requires a more radical theoretical move.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This research programme develops a political sociology of these social and inter-organisational networks, how they constitute local governance, and their impact on the access the urban poor have to critical public services. The research program aims to develop a new set of analytic and methodological tools to move away from the notions of state and society, and of coherent and well-bounded public and private actors, and towards a focus on relational networks that cut across these dichotomies and that have systemic effects distinct from, and likely greater than, that of any set of actors or institutions. This theory building will be informed by fieldwork in the cities of S&amp;atilde;o Paulo and Delhi that traces the evolution of the networks in social assistance and their variability in inclusiveness over time.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The programme has policy implications that are of substantial interest to a range of policy actors, and in particular those concerned with how to increase the responsiveness and accountability of public services, how to improve the coordination between public agencies, providers, and other stakeholders, and how to strengthen citizen participation or the influence of agents of the poor over service delivery. The Impact Plan targets three groups of policy actors.

The first are stakeholders in the research in Brazil and India - the members of the inter-organisational and social networks the fieldwork will interview. The research will identify the most influential members of these different stakeholder groups and, through the interviews, establish a relationship with them. The interviewees are of great strategic value because they are agenda setters and can lead the uptake of new ideas and lessons by the respective networks. Policy actors from other service areas, such as health, will also be interested and access the material through their ties to the above network members. The applicant will publish a policy-training booklet for these stakeholders and also disseminate it through the websites of national research centres and an event at the host research centres in S&amp;atilde;o Paulo and Delhi. The training material is modelled on one developed in previous work in S&amp;atilde;o Paulo, which is being used by Ministry of Social Development in Brazil to train tens of thousands of Bolsa Familia participatory councils members (acclaimed conditional cash transfer programme). The material has spread to a surprisingly wide array of advocacy NGO and think tanks, and is being used in university courses at the prestigious Funda&amp;ccedil;&amp;atilde;o Getulio Vargas.

The second group are professionals in international development, based at bi-lateral and multi-lateral organisations and international NGOs, who support, design, and sometimes manage projects of state reform or civil society strengthening. The ImpStrategy is demand and supply-led. The applicant and his IDS colleagues are frequently asked by organisations such as UK's DFID and the World Bank to provide advisory services, conduct evaluations, participate in seminars or conferences, or run training workshops. The applicant will introduce and support the uptake of the programme's content through these activities. On the supply side, the policy-training publication will be distributed through the up-to-date and specialised contact list of the former Development Research Centre for the Future State - the Centre terminated its 10-year life cycle in 2010 but its contact list has become a live dissemination tool for the IDS Governance Team to which the applicant belongs. The applicant will also introduce the programme's content in to the IDS MA programmes, which train staff for a range of development organisations. Finally, the IDS is a global leader in on-line dissemination of research and the applicant will work with its Communication Team to select which of its services are best suited.

The third group are a large universe of scholars who serve as advisors to elected officials, government agencies, civil society campaigns, and other policy actors; contribute directly to the design of policy or evaluation; and/or write for policy audiences and participate in public debate. The applicant will produce academic articles of high quality but that are accessible to a cross-disciplinary audience, and present at social science conferences and seminars. For the scholars in Brazil and Indian the applicant will support the local project consultants in writing articles for national journals such as Novos Estudos in Brazil and Economic and Political Weekly in India, and in presenting at the host research institutes.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-03-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>200258</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/J005894/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>ACFABADE-E54A-4FC7-B9F5-259A19D97CDB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Work</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>32A0976A-B577-4829-A940-9AB6B148F977</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Area &amp; Development Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F7EEE6CD-E283-4BAB-BA5E-70B4B0F1F1A6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACFABADE-E54A-4FC7-B9F5-259A19D97CDB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Work</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
