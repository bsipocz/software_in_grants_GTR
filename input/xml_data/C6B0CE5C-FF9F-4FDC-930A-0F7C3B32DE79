However, there is a glaring disparity in the amount of UK based theoretical work on the development and analysis of cell signalling models. Now is the time to take up the challenge of developing a body of theoretical work that can complement and enhance this area of UK research excellence. We propose to hold a one day workshop that will bring together predominantly UK based researchers who are working to understand the dynamics of cellular calcium signals. This will be complemented by the invitation of other mainland European and US experts, and the timely arrival in the UK of one the worlds leading mathematical biologists, Prof Jim Keener (Utah). The mathematical tools to be discussed will include the traditional tools of mathematical biology (such as nonlinear dynamical systems theory) but also powerful new techniques from non-equilibrium statistical physics, which are needed to address the inherently stochastic nature of calcium release from cells.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2006-08-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-04-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>3581</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Mathematical modelling of cellular calcium signals</gtr:description><gtr:form>Scientific meeting (conference/symposium etc.)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BE056849-EACD-48F3-81E8-0D6E1E860DE8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A one-day workshop on the mathematical modelling of cellular calcium signals organised by Dr Stephen Coombes was held at the University of Nottingham on 28 April 2006. The goal of the meeting was to bring together leading experts in the field of experimental and theoretical analysis of cellular calcium dynamics and to provide a stimulating exchange among scientists working on various aspects of the cellular calcium toolbox.

Prof Jim Keener (Mathematics, Utah) opened the meeting with a solid introduction about the true nature of cellular calcium dynamics. He discussed the widespread deterministic approaches and opposed them to newly emerging stochastic methods. Prof Keener proposed a mathematical model for the generation of the fundamental building blocks of intracellular calcium dynamics, i.e. calcium sparks or puffs, and showed how the transition from sparks to waves can be understood in terms of a stochastic fire-diffuse-fire model. Dr Thomas H&amp;ouml;fer (Theoretical Biophysics, Berlin) spoke next on modeling molecular steps of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) induced calcium release. He demonstrated how positive and negative feedback of calcium on IP3 production shape the intracellular calcium patterns. He pointed out that such feedbacks may play a central role in frequency encoding. Focussing again on the stochastic character of intracellular calcium dynamics, Prof Gregory D. Smith (Applied Math, College of William and Mary) gave first an excellent overview of the impact of buffers on calcium concentration profiles. He then incorporated them into a stochastic automata network description for a single IP3 receptor cluster and showed the effect of time scale separation between channel dynamics and calcium dynamics on calcium oscillations. Dr Martin Bootman (Molecular Signalling, Babraham institute) addressed the role of calcium in excitation-contraction coupling and presented inspiring experimental findings for atrial myocytes. He brought home that the interplay between cellular components as e.g. calcium channels, mitochondria and SERCA pumps as well as their spatial arrangement are of pivotal relevance for understanding excitation-contraction coupling in atrial myocytes. Dr Martin Falcke (Hahn-Meitner Institut, Berlin) continued Prof Keener's discussion on the stochastic nature of intracellular calcium dynamics and presented thoroughly mathematical arguments on the absence of calcium oscillations in deterministic approaches. He supported these ideas with new experimental results in different cell types and presented a novel method to compute calcium puff frequencies. The meeting concluded with a talk by Dr Alex Webb (Plant Sciences, Cambridge) who gave fabulous insights into the role of calcium in plant circadian rhythm. His experimental data shed new light on the molecular network of the circadian clock and helped to identify new components in this network.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-4879004587.3066450b887f04</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:presentationType>workshop facilitator</gtr:presentationType><gtr:primaryAudience>Participants in your research and patient groups</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.maths.nottingham.ac.uk/personal/sc/calcium/index.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2006</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>A one-day workshop on the mathematical modelling of cellular calcium signals organised by Dr Stephen Coombes was held at the University of Nottingham on 28 April 2006.
