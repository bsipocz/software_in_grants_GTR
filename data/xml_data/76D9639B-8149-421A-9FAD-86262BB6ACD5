Yet the way in which biodiversity affects different services is poorly understood scientifically, especially when considering the real world rather than small-scale studies. Lowland agricultural landscapes are particular 'crunch' points, where food security needs to be balanced with the provision of other ecosystem services against the backdrop of a changing climate. Many of these services are in conflict, such as crop production, climate regulation and cultural services. Already, agricultural landscapes show signs of degradation, with consequences for their biodiversity and the provisioning and resilience of services.

The 'Wessex-BESS' project will address the fundamental challenge of the BESS program in linking biodiversity change with the delivery of ecosystem services across landscapes and into the future. We will do this by integrating experiments with large-scale biodiversity and environmental gradients existing in the Wessex Chalk landscape. This contains arable, grassland and riverine ecosystems, and offers a unique opportunity to exploit large-scale 'natural experiments'. Specifically, Salisbury Plain contains large areas of unfragmented semi-natural habitat and shares the topography and deeper chalk soils of surrounding intensive farmland, making comparisons possible. Furthermore, the area contains many ecological restoration programmes that we will use as experimental platforms for large-scale biodiversity manipulations. To allow the broad characterisation of biodiversity-ecosystem service relationships, and a framework for other researchers to exploit, research will encompass: a wide range of ecosystems from terrestrial to freshwater; taxonomic groups from bacteria to birds; multiple biodiversity measures from genetic and species diversity to landscape heterogeneity; and regulating, provisioning and cultural services. Collaboration with other initiatives using this landscape (incl. NERC 'Macronutrients Cycle', Defra 'Test Catchments', Natural England 'Nature Improvement Areas') will add scientific value and impact, and partnership with a large number of conservation and land/water management organisations will ensure the research and findings have applied and policy relevance.

We have a consortium comprising international leaders in biodiversity and ecosystem service research. Project partners will ensure that scientific outcomes influence best practice and policy. The collaborative approach (with partners involved in ecosystem service provision) represents a cost-effective way to understand the scaling of biodiversity-service relationships. The Wessex Chalk Area is an excellent test bed for possible futures as it faces imminent threats from both climate and land use change (e.g. agricultural intensification), which are already being addressed using large-scale restoration. We will focus on the contrasting services of crop production, climate regulation, water quality, and cultural services.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Today, ca. 80% of the Earth's land surface shows evidence of human intervention. Radical action is needed to sustain well-functioning ecosystems and biodiversity, which together assure the delivery of ecosystem services at the level needed for a healthy planet and thus our own existence. These ecosystem services are benefits humans obtain from nature, and they underpin human well-being, by providing such essential goods as clean water, climate regulation, improved crop yield, hazard prevention, and a pleasant environment. By examining the provision of services for a particular landscape - the Wessex Chalk -and the underpinning role of biodiversity, this project will benefit society as a whole by demonstrating essential ecosystem services in the UK and by determining mechanisms to maintain services in a changing environment. 

To consider more specific benefits. Local to the Wessex Chalk landscape, we have engaged with a wide range of end-users from the conception of the proposed research. They have actively helped to develop the proposal and guide the research by identifying their individual needs. The social science research in the project will broaden out form these specific contacts to consider benefits and involvement of a wider range of members of society, involving individuals as well as organisations. Thus, the research will provide real benefits and utility to local people and organisations. More broadly, the research will underpin policy efforts to focus activities on maintaining and enhancing ecosystem services. International activities include: Council of Europe - 2010 'A headline target of halting the loss of biodiversity and the degradation of ecosystem services in the EU by 2020&amp;quot;; the Nagoya 2010 new CBD 2020 targets including resilience of ecosystem services; the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020, including Aichi Biodiversity Targets; the Inter-governmental Science-Policy Platform for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) ; and TEEB (the ecology and economics of biodiversity). UK activities include: the UKNEA aiming to enhance understanding of the state of ecosystem services; Lawton review 'Making Space for Nature' and the linked Environment White Paper. These efforts are against a background of the need for increased food security, climate change and other major drovers of change. By linking mechanistic research with a detailed analysis of policy and societal needs, we will provide scientific evidence to inform future decisions</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-02-04</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>400775</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Stakeholder Workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1433746C-8AD7-43A3-B00C-5A6D95079547</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Of the three primary drivers of land use change (agriculture, urbanisation and catchment management) we have decided to first focus on agricultural land use change and urbanisation
 
For agriculture- we will primarily consider potential shifts in farming from pasture towards arable crops, balanced with an increase in land set aside as ecological focus areas under the CAP reform. Spatial allocation will be based on clusters of neighbouring farms and potential agricultural value of land.
 
For urbanisation- we will consider local authority development plans, balanced with biodiversity offsetting through habitat creation. This offsetting will either be focussed on increasing connectivity of landscapes for threatened biodiversity (e.g. Lawton review/ NEWP vision), or aimed at increasing other ecosystem services (e.g. pollination, pest control and recreation).
 
In the next year we will produce a large number of maps, each a different permutation of these scenarios. These maps will be used to assess the expected changes in delivery of ecosystem services of pollination, pest control, water quality (N and P eutrophication) and recreation. We will forward on summary results as they arrive, and just let us know if you would like to use the raw scenario maps generated.

The roadshow took place in 3 events - the FLS Community Open Day, a special adult-only event at the Manchester Museum and a one day exhibition at the Jodrell Bank Observatory is Cheshire. The open day saw over 850 people come to the University where they got to learn about the exciting life of plants.

For the one day exhibition the team were based at the Jodrell Discover Centre. The family friendly event saw cockroaches running up children's arms, earthworms moving through soil and hands on experiences with carnivorous plants. The adults at the centre were taught about food security, radioactive contamination and soil ecology.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cc5a6be7f787.30682772</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ls.manchester.ac.uk/news/categories/research/articles/?id=A-Summer-of-Science---a-Celebration-of-Environmental-Research</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The findings of our work have been presented to stakeholders in a talk entitled &amp;quot;Biodiversity aids resistance to environmental extremes in grasslands&amp;quot; at the Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services and Sustainability (BESS) stakeholder meeting, Royal Society, London, January 2017.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2017</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>015F8936-7CDA-476E-8EC5-4B14654FA83F</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5460fb14cb3a58.05472991</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project is still ongoing, but key activities so far are: 

1. In February 2013 two sites were chosen on Salisbury Plain for establishment of field manipulative experiments. They were required to have low nutrient soils, with no history of chemical inputs, with a low weed load, preferably on land going into HLS agreements. These sites were intended to constitute a plant removal study from a high diversity grassland, and a plant addition study on an area of bare ground. The removal site was on Parsonage Down NNR near Winterbourne Stoke (OS SU 05636 41684), an area of high plant diversity. The addition site was at Winklebury Hill near Berwick St John (OS ST 94756 19924). 

2. A functional diversity classification was created in order to divide local chalk grassland species into three groups based on carbon capture and nutrient retention characteristics. These included root type (tap root, fibrous roots etc), longevity and specific leaf area. The classification divided the species into plants that were hypothesised to capture and retain a lot of carbon, with poorly decomposable litter (conservative strategy), plants that would grow fast and rapidly capture and metabolise nutrients and water (exploitative strategy), and plants that were somewhere in between the two strategies. 

3. The species classification was applied to the species rich site using a mixture of hand weeding and selective spot-spraying of herbicides in both 2013 and 2014. The addition site had species mixtures seeded in in May 2013. Each site had all seven combinations of the three groups in a randomised plot design. 

4. At the end of the growing season in 2014 the plants at the addition site were well established, although the removal study site was more resistant to perturbation. Significant treatment effects on respiration and photosynthesis were evident in the addition study, where higher gas flux rates were apparent in the group where the species had more shallow, fibrous roots. The lowest rates of photosynthesis were seen in groups where the plants had thick taproots and short stature. 

5. In June 2014 a gradient study was carried out to compare ecosystem service provision across land use types (Arable, Intensive, Reverting and Species Rich) across Salisbury Plain Training Area. Higher stability was observed in the species rich grasslands, and very high process rates such as gas fluxes and N mineralisation were observed in the intensive grassland. 

6. In 2015 rain shelters were added to plots in the addition site for six weeks, mimicking a drought event that is projected to occur once in a century (IPCC AR5 scenario A2; 2014). We observed that the calcareous assemblages were highly significantly susceptible to summer drought, and that across a range of response variables including dissolved organic N, the groups with shallow fibrous roots were significantly more resistant than the tap rooted species. 

7. In 2016 the shelters were replaced on the plots to looks for legacy effects on ecosystem functioning in the grasslands. The same measures were repeated as previously. 

8. The soil and vegetation measures were supplemented in 2016 with a collaboration with the University of Exeter; an MSc student collected data on nectar provisioning and visitation rates of pollinators before and after the shelters are up. Furthermore, a PhD student from Queens University Belfast collected soil samples at the same time points to determine community diversity and richness of soil microarthropods and nematodes, and microbial community analyses have been undertaken by CEH.
