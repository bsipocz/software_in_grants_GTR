The theory of associative learning asserts that the mental representations of co-occurring events become linked, such that presentation of one can elicit the thought of the other. This is probably the most elaborated theory of learning in the field, and has considerable explanatory power. For example, the rules governing the conditions under which associations may be formed explains the sensitivity of animals to correlations between environmental events, and hence their ability to learn selectively about events that are causally related, rather than those that co-occur by chance. However, there are some phenomena that are at present outside the scope of associative learning models. For example, in a standard associative learning task an event, which is usually of fixed duration, is followed by an outcome, and the animal will learn not only that the event will be followed by the outcome (conditioning) but when - an effect called timing. Yet despite the intimate relation between these two types of learning, theories of conditioning and of timing have developed independently. Given the fact that timing and conditioning arise alongside each other in the same learning tasks, one might argue that this theoretical framework is fundamentally misconceived, and in more recent years information processing theories of timing have been developed that seek to account for both phenomena. This approach is parsimonious in theory - but in practice, the ability of these such theories to explain conditioning is limited, and much of the explanatory power of associative theory is lost. The alternative approach, to explain timing within the framework of conditioning theory, has been relatively neglected. This proposal aims to test a version of associative theory that has been specifically developed to explain timing effects, with the ultimate objective of developing a unified associative account of conditioning and timing. The predictions of the modified associative theory will be compared with those of an information processing account that has been adapted to explain conditioning. This will be achieved in part by examining the effects of temporal manipulations on a series of associative learning tasks. We will also use lesion techniques. The associative theory we have adapted to explain timing also provides an explanation of some of the impairments in cognition produced by damage to the hippocampus, and applying it results in some specific predictions about the conditions under which timing and related deficits will be found in hippocampal animals. Another set of experiments will test these predictions as a means of evaluating our version of this associative theory. This work has implications at a number of levels. Theoretically, by evaluating the modified associative theory, we will assess the extent to which an associative account of timing effects is feasible. Practically, the work on timing has significant clinical implications, insofar as timing abnormalities are heavily implicated in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), as well as in schizophrenia and depression. As the work described in this proposal aims at a complete understanding of the nature of timing, this will aid interpretation of such abnormalities, and so directly inform attempts to identify their neural basis. In addition the section looking at hippocampal function will increase our understanding of the psychological role of this structure, which is heavily implicated in mediating conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. Thus our work will have therapeutic implications in a number of areas. Finally, the study of learning in artificial agents uses models very similar to those used in psychology. The data generated by the experiments we propose should thus be of use in helping to develop theories of machine learning.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>We propose to evaluate an associative model we have modified to explain timing effects, by comparing its predictions to those of an information processing explanation of timing. We will use standard behavioural techniques in normal and lesioned animals to compare predictions of the two theories in a set of standard behavioural tasks. The first section examines the observation that conditioned response rates increase with intertrial interval, and decrease with CS duration. Information processing and associative approaches have fundamentally different explanations for this, and we aim to examine their predictions about the effect of the C/T ratio on conditioning and on timing, in order to discriminate between them. The second section deals with the trace conditioning deficit. Associative models view this as being due to lack of CS-US contiguity, whereas the information processing approach sees it as an instance of a situation in which there are two potential time markers for the US, CS onset and CS offset. These experiments will establish the effects of temporal manipulations on trace conditioning, and compare the ability of the two accounts to explain them. The third section deals with cue competition. Associative theory has a comprehensive account of how learning occurs in cue competition, whereas current information processing theories need to invoke special additional principles to do so. These experiments will compare the predictions of associative and information processing theories with regard to the effects of temporal manipulations on overshadowing and blocking. The associative account we have adapted to explain timing can also explain some of the cognitive deficits produced by hippocampal damage. Applying this theoretical framework leads to some unique predictions about the conditions under which some known effects of hippocampal damage will be observed, and predicts some new ones; the final set of experiments tests some of these predictions.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-07-12</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-07-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>410539</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Associative Learning Symposium</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>13D9BC7F-F07F-4334-8B09-B61279E82E9E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Disseminated results to academics</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5449500db07304.21555055</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Participants in your research and patient groups</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2008,2009,2010,2011,2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited talk to school of Psychiatry, University of Nottingham</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6275A0BB-9B29-4D44-86BC-F9CAAEE8EB4A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>To disseminate information to academics</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54495242b150f1.80206464</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Participants in your research and patient groups</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2011</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited talk to the Pavlovian Society, New York City</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>35675A27-003E-4F10-85E3-849C83456E15</gtr:id><gtr:impact>To disseminate information to academics</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54495155d97837.81600848</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Participants in your research and patient groups</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited talk to Institute of Mental Health, University of Nottingham</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CE5EA642-E305-4367-AEA6-04D32224F986</gtr:id><gtr:impact>To disseminate information to academics</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>544951c4815761.01158407</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Participants in your research and patient groups</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited talk in Department of Basic Psychology, University of Granada</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B14A01FC-7959-4D83-B473-DDA85D65A18B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>To disseminate information to academics</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5449528d7d7de2.10611771</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Participants in your research and patient groups</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Spanish Comparative Psychology Society</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DDA7224D-5842-4531-972C-541E5DF2BD34</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Disseminate results to academics</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>544950cc9cfe89.33064685</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Participants in your research and patient groups</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2009,2011,2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Understanding learning is a central issue in psychology, and has been extensively studied, especially in animal subjects.
