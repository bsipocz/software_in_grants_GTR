&lt;p>The proposed research will further our understanding of the mechanisms underlying DCD and thereby assist in planning more effective interventions to support motor learning.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research?
In the long term it is envisaged that both individuals with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) and clinicians working with these individuals will benefit from this research through the development of intervention protocols. The UK prevalence of DCD is 2% of school-aged children; problems often persist into adulthood and continue to have a severe negative impact on everyday life. Currently, the most common intervention strategies in the treatment of DCD lack scientific rigour. There is a real need for the development of successful and cost-effective intervention programmes. The development of such programmes can only be borne out of a greater understanding of the precise nature of the movement problems in DCD. In other populations, e.g. the elderly, a better understanding of the disorder and its impact on gait has led to the development of effective intervention programmes. Movement deficits are vastly different between traumatic brain injury and DCD; however, this example illustrates how a greater understanding of a disorder can lead to effective interventions. 

How will they benefit from this research?
A greater understanding of locomotor behaviour in individuals with DCD and how this sits within the typical developmental trajectory will have a positive impact in three ways. Firstly, it will be of direct benefit to researchers in the field, aiding conceptualisation and understanding of the disorder. Secondly, a comparison between TD individuals and individuals with DCD will allow observations of the similarities and differences between these groups, i.e. the aspects of movement in individuals with DCD which are not deficient. A thorough understanding of the motor difficulties and motor strengths is needed in order to plan appropriate support. It is hoped that this research will aid future work by providing an understanding of exactly where the focus of future remedial help should be. Finally, the proposed research may enable the identification and quantification of movement problems. Traditionally coarse motor assessments are used in both clinical and research settings to quantify movement ability. It has long been recognised that these measurements can only provide an overview of coordination ability. Performance on aspects of locomotor behaviour, like those described in this proposal, should give researchers a more precise quantification of movement problems and an alternative way in which the motor ability of both typical and atypical children can be described. In turn, this could also provide clinicians with a much clearer quantification of movement weaknesses that cannot be picked up through observation alone. 

What will be done to ensure they benefit from this research?
A range of different communication and engagement plans are proposed which will help to meet the various positive benefits proposed above. The findings of this research project will be disseminated at several academic conferences: Developmental Section of the British Psychological Society conference, the International and National DCD conferences and the European Society of Movement Analysis in Children conference. These conferences are attended by academics and clinicians working in the arena of developmental psychology and DCD. In addition, publication of results in peer reviewed academic journals (such as Developmental Child Neurology and Gait and Posture) will target an academic audience and publication in the professional journal of the Dyspraxia Foundation will target a clinical audience. Locally, results will be disseminated to all parents of participants, the local Dyspraxia Foundation Group and Occupational Therapists known to the PI.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>280261</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Visit to Brunel University to talk to occupational therapy students about DCD</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A355EC22-4D33-4D84-887C-6E27B5F3D397</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The occupational therapy course at Brunel University asked me to attend to discuss DCD from a research perspective with their UG students (i.e. the occupational therapists of the future).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>589dbb19da80e8.00182492</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Undergraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Our findings have been disseminated at local, national and international level in a variety of ways In the short term, our findings have already had impact in terms of enhancing quality of life for individuals and increasing the effectiveness of public services and policy. The knowledge gained from our work will continue to have impact in the medium and longer term. 

Informing the individual: The individual reports we provided to our participants with DCD following the diagnostic assessment have helped these to better understand their condition and, in some cases to obtain extra support in their educational setting as a result of this, thus enhancing their quality of life. 

Informing practice: Our findings have also been presented at local level through a meeting of the Oxford Dyspraxia Foundation Group hosted by Oxford Brookes University. This was attended by individuals with DCD, their parents and families, educational, health and allied health professionals (Occupational Therapists and Physiotherapists), students and other interested persons. For those in educational or health service provision, this provided them with information to inform their practice in working with children and adults with DCD. We plan to host further similar events in the future to extend the reach of our impact. Beyond the local level, we have used our findings to provide specific training for future Allied Health Professionals (students in Occupational Therapy) at Brunel University, London. Occupational Therapists commonly work with children with DCD and a better understanding of their locomotor and navigational abilities helps to inform their general understanding of DCD and their intervention practices. We plan to repeat this training to reach other students during the course of their studies. 

Informing future guidelines: Our findings focusing on adults with DCD have had and continue to have a special impact. Our approach to the assessment of DCD in adulthood has been adopted by others working in this field and is recommended on the Movement Matters website (www.movementmattersuk.org) for those working with adults. This work has also enabled us to contribute to the first set of European guidelines produced for those working with adults with DCD along with the specific findings being included in the first scoping review of the motor difficulties in adults with DCD. This is due to be presented to researchers, practitioners, parents and individuals with DCD at the 12th International Conference on DCD in Fremantle, Australia in July 2017. Our assessment methods and findings will also be featured in a pre-conference international workshop for adults with DCD, parents, educators, clinicians, researchers, service providers and commissioners of services. In this way, our findings will contribute to gaining an international perspective on how nations can best support adults with DCD.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>9358FA36-6FFA-4141-9E9D-5959F8237BD5</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>544fbd69de9d84.11792643</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The main aim of this project was to investigate the locomotor abilities of children and adults with and without Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD). The objectives of the grant were met and the project has generated three peer-reviewed publications in academic journals (with a further two under review and one in preparation).

We focused on four key aspects of locomotor ability:

(1) Walking patterns: although we saw no differences between individuals with and without DCD in step length and step width measures, we found a lack of consistency in the movements made by individuals with DCD. Furthermore, the adults with DCD showed a greater forward-backward acceleration compared to their peers while the children with DCD showed a greater side-to-side acceleration. 

(2) Negotiating obstacles: individuals with DCD and their parents often report a tendency to bump into obstacles. Is this because they have a difficulty using their vision to judge whether they can fit through a narrow gap or because they cannot adjust their movements appropriately? When looking at gaps individuals with DCD underestimated the space they would need to fit through compared to their peers. In contrast, when they actually walked through the gap, both children and adults with DCD over-estimated how much space they needed, turning their shoulders more than their peers. This suggests an adaptive strategy taking account of their movement difficulties. None of our participants actually bumped into the obstacles, suggesting that in this laboratory environment individuals with DCD have time to check their initial visual judgement, eventually turning more than necessary. It may be that in a more cluttered/distracting environment individuals do not check their initial judgement which results in a collision. 

(3) Negotiating unexpected obstacles: preliminary analyses show that all of our participants adapt their walking to prepare for the possibility of an obstacle appearing. However, once the obstacle does appear individuals with DCD slow earlier in their movement and leave a greater safety margin around the obstacle. This again suggests an adaptive strategy. We also saw that children with and without DCD made larger but fewer adjustments in their steps to avoid the obstacle. Further analyses of this dataset are required. 

(4) Changes with Age: we included a wide age range of participants allowing us to consider the developmental trajectory of DCD. Our data demonstrated that some aspects of locomotor control do change with age in both typical and atypical development. However, on the whole, where we saw a difference between children with and without DCD, this still remained in adulthood. This important finding demonstrates that individuals with DCD do develop locomotor control but this does not allow them to 'catch-up' to their peers.

Overall we have demonstrated many similarities in the way individuals with DCD control their locomotion compared to their peers. However, we have also identified some key differences which help explain the everyday difficulties experienced by these individuals and their strategies for adapting to these. Although this remains a descriptive study it provides an important insight into better understanding the condition.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The results of this research demonstrate the way in which locomotion is controlled both typically and atypically. This topic has a range of important applications, from developing our understanding of the nature of DCD to informing the development of successful interventions in the future. Key findings have been presented: to academics and clinicians through five conference presentations and (to date) two peer-reviewed publications; to trainee clinicians through one invited talk and; to service users through two hosted meetings of the Dyspraxia Foundation. The interest generated by these events has highlighted ways in which this research may be taken forward:
1) By academics: This work could be extended by considering locomotion in more naturalistic environment, thus demonstrating differences between locomotor control in the lab versus the outside world. Furthermore, our work on the negotiation of an unexpected obstacle is the first of its kind in a child population; therefore, the method of analysis we have established here could be used by other researchers. 
2) By communities and healthcare professionals: This work demonstrates differences in the way in which children and adults with DCD avoid obstacles in their pathway. This knowledge may help individuals with DCD to adopt strategies to avoid collision.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5A252587-FFF1-4E59-8C55-24098D626138</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544fbcf547b6e3.08990086</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social
