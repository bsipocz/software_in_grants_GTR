Knowledge, understandings and identities within different communities need recognition if cross-community engagement and development work is to be undertaken; those who themselves cross communities or identify with multiple health and social care communities may be valuable 'connectors', in either formal or informal roles. In contrast to predominant theories in organisational studies (e.g. functionalist; social learning), humanities offers the lens of virtue ethics with which to examine connectedness in communities and change over time. Workshop activity found that whilst policy can be disruptive of pre-existing communities in health and social care, communities can respond, to affirm their purpose and seek joint understandings of purpose with others. Future research should explore how communities in health and social care respond to changing circumstances, and what factors influence whether community forms and capacity are enabled or threatened by policy and practice developments.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>32403</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Birmingham</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>School of Education</gtr:department><gtr:description>Collaboration between Health Services Management Centre and Department of Social Policy and Social Work at University of Birmingham</gtr:description><gtr:id>BE3C3039-5C2C-436B-B106-D68D75D88C3F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Conroy, M, Clarke, H. &amp;amp; Wilson, L.

were central to discussion. The value of the &amp;quot;reticulist&amp;quot; (who can carry knowledge and
understanding between communities) was posited, recognising that knowledge and
cultures in different sites requires acknowledgement and understanding. Change over
time and increased barriers around communities (e.g. practice-based; service-user
group) were identified as linked to resources and competition. Concerns included
marginalisation and restriction of engagement through top-down definitions of
community. 

Top-down versus citizen-led approaches to community building were discussed:
health/patient-focused ascriptions of community membership were viewed as having a
narrower &amp;quot;vulnerability&amp;quot; focus and individualising impact, whilst a wider community
development remit was seen as more empowering, encompassing more citizens, and
involving wider influencers on well-being (e.g. housing). Whilst community building
with/by citizens in the health and social care arena was viewed positively as a balance
against consumer-based engagement, there was concern that individuals in communities
who can mobilise themselves will fare better, risking strengthening inequalities.
Individuals who belong to local communities acting as &amp;quot;connectors&amp;quot; between structures
and citizens were seen as a potentially inclusive model: this was explored in the
literature following the workshop, and reflects developing &amp;quot;community navigator&amp;quot; practice
in the UK (e.g. Care Navigators: Turning Point, 2010; Bruce et al 2011). 

In order to apply the theoretical lens afforded by MacIntyre it becomes important to
understand the notion of virtue as a mean growing out of engagement with that practice,
not predefined. Any community needs rules or an ethos to hold it together: Aristotle in
Nichomachean Ethics (1958) suggests a set of virtue continuums (Courage, Generosity,
Magnificence, Pride, Anger, Truth and Indignation). MacIntyre was careful to avoid such
definitions, and we therefore allowed the accounts from our workshop practitioners to
define the virtues of connectedness in H&amp;amp;SCCs. Using a virtue continuum lens we
mapped stories of connected communities from our workshop participants (Figure 1 in the report at the URL).

Within the workshop we heard examples of practice which countered policy and practice
impositions perceived as potentially disruptive of communities by pre-defining the terms
of engagement: the focus was the incremental development of working relationships 
within and across communities, engaging with the learning in communities and seeking
to develop a common purpose.

The seminar suggested that the above theorising was helpful to participants in
understanding connectedness as a set of continuums. Participants talked about &amp;quot;moving
from the orange to the blue&amp;quot; (see figure 1 in the report at the URL) and vice versa. It seemed to give them a way of expressing
their social reality of connectedness when working in H&amp;amp;SCCs. Notable by their absence,
both in the workshop and feedback seminar, were accounts of sacred/profane or
moral/immoral continuums which is arguably consistent with MacIntyre&amp;quot;s thesis that the
resources to maintain such ethical debates have become disrupted. 

The ways that communities transmit their practice ethics (MacIntyre, 1985) and support
membership generativity (i.e. their contribution to future generations of their material
creations, knowledge and culture: Imada, 2004) require research, policy and practice
attention, particularly when models of delivery are experiencing rapid change. By way of
example, the recent white paper (Department of Health 2010) issued under the Coalition
government presents a solution to the challenge of cost savings which is inherently
structural functional: removing layers of &amp;quot;bureaucracy&amp;quot; (SHAs and PCTs) and handing
responsibility for the commissioning of healthcare to new structures (GP Consortia). A
CoP lens shows the potential for shared learning and knowledge bonds being lost.
MacIntyre&amp;quot;s lens presents an even more disturbing loss, of practice ethics that build over
time in any community: the generational handing down of practice knowledge and ethics 
is highly likely to be disrupted as we have seen previously, in mental health services
(Conroy, 2010).

Future research should explore how organisational, practice and user/citizen
communities which engage in health and social care respond to change, and what factors
influence whether community forms and capacity are enabled or threatened by policy
and practice developments.

Further research should contribute to our understanding of how health and social care
policy implementation impacts on communities&amp;quot; lived-experience, health and well being.

Navigators and 'reticulists'
Research should identify opportunities for and barriers to community development,
foregrounding people&amp;quot;s lived conceptions of community. Multiple community
memberships, cross-community engagement, and the experience of managing different
identities in different communities (incorporating lay, political or professional health and
social care perspectives) should be priorities in future research. The developing research
focus on community/care navigators in the UK should be expanded to incorporate citizen
navigators (engaging with multiple H&amp;amp;SCCs in a personal capacity), formal (paid and
voluntary) navigators (engaged to link people of their own personal communities with
services), and professional navigators (&amp;quot;reticulists&amp;quot; who are able to enter different health
and social care policy/service realms and engage positively in different structural and
cultural environments).
Policy for generative health and social care communities?
The ways that communities transmit their practice ethics (MacIntyre, 1985) and support
membership generativity (i.e. their contribution to future generations of their material
creations, knowledge and culture: Imada, 2004) require research, policy and practice
attention, particularly when models of delivery are experiencing rapid change. By way of
example, the recent white paper (Department of Health 2010) issued under the Coalition

Virtue (1985) contain very strong arguments of what we have lost in our understanding
of community and societal connections. That loss is of shared virtues which operate
through practice in service of wellbeing for all in society. In MacIntyre&amp;quot;s virtues-goodspractices-institution
schema (Moore and Beadle 2006) practice excellence offers rewards
for practitioners and citizens (internal goods), binds practitioners in one practice group
together, binds different practice groups together across institutional boundaries and
further still binds people across sectors in any given community. The theory
encompasses dynamic development of community connections by members who are
continually clarifying their personal aims by meshing with collective aims in a way that
serves the wellbeing of all in society. VE can be viewed as building on SF and social
learning theories to encompass the ethical connections between all practitioners in any
given society regardless of discipline. 

The way MacIntyre envisages the collective relationship of practices, the narrative of the
institution and their potential disruption is summarised by McCann and Brownsberger
(1990) who stress the centrality of telos (purpose) to human life. Disruption may involve
loss of a shared sense of telos and a corresponding lack of agreement concerning social
practices and the virtues that underpin them. For MacIntyre (1985) disruption and
corruption derive more often than not from an (individual or collective) bias in focus on
external goods (money, status and power) rather than on internal goods.
Workshop illustration: virtue as a mean
In order to apply the theoretical lens afforded by MacIntyre it becomes important to
understand the notion of virtue as a mean growing out of engagement with that practice,
not predefined. Any community needs rules or an ethos to hold it together: Aristotle in
Nichomachean Ethics (1958) suggests a set of virtue continuums (Courage, Generosity,
Magnificence, Pride, Anger, Truth and Indignation). MacIntyre was careful to avoid such
definitions, and we therefore allowed the accounts from our workshop practitioners to
define the virtues of connectedness in H&amp;amp;SCCs. Using a virtue continuum lens we
mapped stories of connected communities from our workshop participants (Figure 1 - see the URL).

Within the workshop we heard examples of practice which countered policy and practice
impositions perceived as potentially disruptive of communities by pre-defining the terms
of engagement: the focus was the incremental development of working relationships 
within and across communities, engaging with the learning in communities and seeking
to develop a common purpose.

mapped stories of connected communities from our workshop participants (Figure 1 - see the URL report).

Within the workshop we heard examples of practice which countered policy and practice
impositions perceived as potentially disruptive of communities by pre-defining the terms
of engagement: the focus was the incremental development of working relationships 
within and across communities, engaging with the learning in communities and seeking
to develop a common purpose.


The methods used were:
Literature review: examining knowledge and debate concerning &amp;quot;communities&amp;quot; in
health and social care.
Networking/Collaborative Activity:
1. Workshop learning event to identify key communities in the lived experience
of participants to inform the literature review.
2. A seminar event with invited participants to present findings and identify
future directions in &amp;quot;health and social care communities&amp;quot; research.</gtr:description><gtr:id>1C6E477C-0027-4350-91BF-BA48E02CDA89</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The seminar suggested that the theorising (virtue continuum model) was helpful to participants in
understanding connectedness as a set of continuums. Participants talked about &amp;quot;moving
from the orange to the blue&amp;quot; and vice versa. It seemed to give them a way of expressing
their social reality of connectedness when working in H&amp;amp;SCCs. Notable by their absence,
both in the workshop and feedback seminar, were accounts of sacred/profane or
moral/immoral continuums which is arguably consistent with MacIntyre's thesis that the
resources to maintain such ethical debates have become disrupted.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58baf3f7ed08a9.33004134</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Scoping Review, workshop and feedback seminar using 'Virtue Continuum Model' developed as part of the research</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/documents/project-reports-and-reviews/connected-communities/connected-health-and-social-care-communities/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>71286198-78BA-4D23-814A-506670A0AD95</gtr:id><gtr:title>Connected Health and Social Care Communities</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/28284e82d223fc9175e91ae1c2ef9d1d"><gtr:id>28284e82d223fc9175e91ae1c2ef9d1d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Conroy, M.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58bae086aabaa5.44723554</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/J500069/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
