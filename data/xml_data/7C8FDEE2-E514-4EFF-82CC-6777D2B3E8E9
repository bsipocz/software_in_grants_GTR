 &lt;li>assess the role of different configurations of disability within the households of older people; looking at couples where one or both have a disability and how that relates to the receipt of benefits/care services.&lt;/li>

The more immediate impact will be felt through better-informed policy making. We aim to deliver evidence that can be taken into account in national policy development and its local implementation. The principal users of this evidence will be national policy makers (Government Ministers and their officials, MPs in both Houses of Parliament), the devolved administrations of the constituent countries of the UK, local government, voluntary organisations (e.g. those representing older people) and commercial enterprises (e.g. insurance companies and care providers) who seek to influence debate in this area. Our findings will be relevant to the work of the Department of Health, the Department of Work and Pensions and HM Treasury. While the main geographical focus of our study is the UK, our research questions are relevant to policy makers in all countries undergoing population ageing. 

Beneficial to these users will be evidence on:

- the extent to which the well-being of an older person is affected by the disability of his/her partner or other members of the household and the likely consequences for their wellbeing of taking account of a partner's disability in determining entitlement to publicly-funded care services and disability benefits;
- whether equivalent-value care services and disability benefits mitigate the impact of disability on wellbeing to the same or differing extents; 
- the responsiveness of the current systems of care and disability benefits to changes in older people's needs for care and whether any delays in the system affect their wellbeing;
- the likely effect on the wellbeing of different groups of disabled older people (older/younger, poor/rich, single people/couples etc.) of potential changes in the balance of public funding for care services and disability benefits, for example increasing the levels of one and decreasing those of the other, or extending the eligibility criteria for one and decreasing it for the other.

Such evidence, if acted upon, has the potential to increase the effectiveness of public services and policy in this area and enhance the quality of life of older people. This is a live area of policy debate and evidence is likely to be immediately beneficial to policy makers with benefits to older disabled people and tax payers flowing as soon as any policy reforms are implemented.

We expect our experience of dealing with the survey measurement issues relating to disability and wellbeing to have impact among survey designers and managers, including those at ONS and Understanding Society and other organisations involved in primary survey research. This impact will ultimately take the form of improvements in the quality of future surveys.

Staff working on the project will enhance their analytical and communication skills in ways which could be applied in many employment sectors.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>152120</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seminar for the Department for Work and Pensions: Target efficiency of public support for older disabled people in Great Britain</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DBD7F2E2-7BCE-4FCE-B215-A38F896E20C3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The presentation generated questions and discussions on both methodological and policy aspects of the findings

Key pathways to impact have included: oral presentation of findings to the Department of Work and Pensions (November 2014), to attendees from a wide range of sectors at a House of Lords seminar hosted by Baroness Campbell (June 2015), and at the Department of Health seminar (October 2015) which included also officials from the Department of Work and Pensions and from HM Treasury; submission of written evidence to the Health Select Committee (published November 2014) and an on-line contribution to 'Hard Evidence' (September 2015). Following the seminar at the Department of Health, officials asked us to scrutinise some related analysis they had undertaken. We produced a detailed note for them in which we demonstrated that their own analysis was potentially very misleading in terms of its policy implications.

Debate about the target efficiency of disability benefits for older people continues, with reform of these benefits remaining on the political agenda. As a result of our impact generating activities, officials in key Government Departments are now aware that any reform of disability benefits should recognise that the existing system, despite being largely non means-tested, is quite well targeted by both income and disability but leaves a substantial proportion of those facing the highest personal costs of disability in deep poverty. They are aware of our findings that tailoring rates of disability benefits more closely to levels of disability and hence to personal disability costs, combined with ensuring that more of the most disabled older people receive these benefits, could alleviate deep poverty amongst the most disabled older people. It is too soon to know whether the Government will pursue reforms along these lines.

In addition to the impact generating activities described above (and in more detail elsewhere on Researchfish), the research team are nearing completion of a non-technical report for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF), drawing on the project's findings, which will be used by them as part of their anti-poverty strategy. We expect this to result in a high profile for our work in policy circles and hence to be a very important pathway to impact.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>1D03241D-E32D-4A86-8596-B974303B47B7</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56337e731c33f4.60740721</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project has generated important messages for the design of systems of public support for older people with disabilities. In the UK, this system has two parts: nationally-administered cash disability benefits, overseen by the central government through the Department for Work and Pensions; and social care which is administered by Local Authorities. Disability benefits (notably the Attendance Allowance (AA) and Disability Living Allowance (DLA) programmes) are largely non-means tested, while the Local Authority social care system is strongly means tested. We found that:

? Later life socio-economic inequalities in disability have increased among successive birth cohorts and this trend could increase the share of later life care costs borne by the state in the future (source: analysis of ten years of the UK Family Resources Survey).
? If anything, receipt of disability benefits by older people is more strongly (negatively) related to income than social care, despite public support for social care being subject to greater means testing (source: analysis of the 2012 English Longitudinal Study of Ageing). That many more older people receive these non means-tested cash benefits (around 13%) than receive means-tested social care (2.5%), does not, therefore, necessarily mean that cash benefits are less well-targeted than social care, contrary to what has been suggested by some. 
? Receipt of both types of support is strongly (positively) related to disability, with the effect of disability level being somewhat larger for social care (source: analysis of the 2012 English Longitudinal Study of Ageing). That a much smaller proportion of older people receive social care than receive disability benefits thus appears to be due to Local Authorities concentrating their resources on those with the most severe disabilities rather than to means testing.
? Receipt of AA/DLA and receipt of Local Authority funded social care services overlap only partially (just 55% of those reporting receipt of social care report receiving disability benefits). Moreover, fewer than a half of the 20% of older people with the highest levels of disability, receive either disability benefits or Local Authority-funded social care (source: analysis of the 2012 English Longitudinal Study of Ageing)
? It is crucial to allow for the personal costs that disabilities bring, when comparing the disposable incomes of older people with and without disabilities and when analysing how their incomes would be affected by reforms to the public system of support for older disabled people. However, our work has shown that estimates of these personal costs are sensitive to technical issues involved in the choice of measurement technique (source: analysis of various Family Resources Surveys). Further work on these methodological issues is needed, and is continuing. 
? Reforming disability benefits so they reach more of the most disabled people and are set at levels which are more closely related to disability costs, can reduce deep poverty. Similar effects can be achieved with or without more means testing, although results are sensitive to assumptions on take-up of benefits (source: analysis of various Family Resources Surveys). More research is needed on what determines the reach of non means-tested disability benefits.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our work could be used to reform cash disability benefits and/or refine the balance between cash disability benefits and social care for older people. We held an event in the House of Lords in June 2015 to publicise the findings and discuss the policy implications with MPs, policy makers etc.. We have had extensive contact with relevant officials in the Department of Work and Pensions and the Department of Health and are in touch with them about further ways to ensure the policy messages of our findings are widely understood.
