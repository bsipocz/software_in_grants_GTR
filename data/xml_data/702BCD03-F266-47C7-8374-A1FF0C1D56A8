We need freshwater for agriculture, industry and human existence. Access to good quality water is essential for sustainable socio-economic growth. Freshwater ecosystems are finite and globally threatened by increasing environmental degradation caused by destructive land-use and water-management practices and increasing industrialization. The scale of socio-economic activities, urbanisation, industrial operations and agricultural practices in India has reached the point where watersheds across India are being severely impacted. For example, gross organic pollution in India's freshwater resources are common place, resulting in severe toxic burdens, depletion of dissolved oxygen levels and severe pathogenic contamination. Eutrophication, arising from enrichment with nutrients caused by sewage and agro-industrial effluents and agricultural run-off, greatly impact on lakes and impounded rivers. Groundwater bodies are susceptible to leaching from waste dumps, mining and industrial discharges. Finally, despite their potential threat, the distribution, scale and levels of newly emerging water contaminants, e.g. endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), are largely unknown. We must address the consequences of both present and future contaminant threats to water catchments if we are to provide action that provide solutions at all levels. The implementation of sensors for monitoring important biological and chemical parameters, through time and space, is the indispensable basis for accurate assessments whilst the deployment of state-of-the-art water treatment technologies for the removal of pollutants will enhance water protection and security.

The Proposition: 
Firstly; improve our ability to determine the presence of pollution in water courses and the development of novel sensing approaches to help reduce or prevent pollution at source. We will do this via; 

The deployment and implementation of new in situ fluorescence sensors that have been developed by UWE, Bristol and Chelsea Technology Group (CTG) as part of a current NERC Grant (NE/K007572/1) 

The development of a novel bacterial bio-sensor using bio-reporter strains that was first conceived in India (Bose Institute), for the detection of endocrine disrupting chemicals in water bodies and effluents. 

Secondly; develop novel approaches to reduce or prevent pollution detected above at the source via; 

The development of novel off-grid treatment technologies, for rural and urban areas, to remove pollutants (sensed above) based on ultrafiltration membrane technology and bacterial remediation using bio-reactors.

Longer-term Impact: To understand the impact of sewage contamination and the bacterial quality of freshwater catchments in India. To quantify changes in sewage contamination levels through time and space and to understand how these changes are affected by land use and effluent discharges. Our fluorescence sensor will be used to identify, monitor and detect bacterial contamination from sewage discharges entering waters at a catchment scale, including urbanised areas. To develop a bacterial sensor, using bio-reporter strains, for the detection of endocrine disrupting chemicals in discharges and freshwaters. We will also assess the feasibility of the catabolic potential of these biosensor strains for bioreactor-based remediation of EDCs and implement an off-grid UF membrane technology platform for the treatment of bacterial contamination. This UK/India partnership will involve the deployment of UK developed technologies in India and the subsequent development of Indian inspired sensors and treatment approaches in the UK.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Impact will be maximised at a community, economic and academic level. It is ultimately envisaged that the outcomes from the project will be provide solutions to water quality issues to local authorities, policy makers, stakeholder and local communities. Project partners will be fully engaged will work closely with community leaders and members who will play a key role in promoting engagement with the project from design to implementation. Monthly community workshops will raise awareness about water quality and the needs/benefits of good catchment management with a view to promoting water security awareness and importance. Our work with local communities, with the support of Frank Water, will work and liaise with small farmers.

Research partners will hold various workshops in both the UK (Bristol) and India (Kolkata) to engage stakeholders and community members for the design of our monitoring strategy, treatment technologies and future sensor development. Both Bose Institute (BI) and University of the West of England, Bristol (UWE) will produce marketing and educational material for local communities, schools and councils. We will also make short YouTube videos (educational and awareness) raising issues such as water quality monitoring and the technologies for water treatment, all of this will link to issues relating to nutrient recovery, wastewater recycling, water savings and water security. 

UWE will organise a project specific stakeholders' kick-off meeting in Bristol to bring together the research teams from India and the UK to openly discuss and disseminate progress and project outcomes. This workshop will be in addition to the national workshops that are planned as part of the Newton Bhahba funding scheme. International impact will occur through dissemination of our work at specialist international conferences and workshops, specifically, at relevant IWA, International Sustainable Development, Faecal Management Sludge, and International Development conferences. We will publish (open access) via international peer reviewed journals such as Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology, Water Research, Environmental Science and Technology. 
A website for the research will be developed by the BI and UWE teams (hosted at UWE) where all details relating to our research will be uploaded for widespread dissemination. Progress reports, updates on pilot case studies and events will be shared via this website. This website will be made available to relevant stakeholders in India via the Bose Institute. Additional virtual tools will aid international dissemination via our partners which represent academia, charities, business and research institutes. Bose Institute UCL support, will engage with Brazilian media (newspapers, magazine and local television stations) and local media agencies will be invited to participate in project workshops/stakeholder consultation activities. 

Regular updates of our project will be circulated to all partner institutions inviting for participation in project activities and outcomes where appropriate. This will support synergies and development of joint research at both BI and UWE. UWE and BI will disseminate key findings and influence scientists through existing postgraduate and undergraduate programmes (e.g. MSc in Biosensing Technology (University of Bristol and UWE).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-01-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-01-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>348956</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/R003106/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C9A78518-54CF-4145-A680-F2BDCFB3913B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>80</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pollution, waste &amp; resources</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>99E0B904-CAB5-4511-AFB3-AA6D2B171F97</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Process engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DC6B2467-35B6-4997-9582-1BF957B82697</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>80</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pollution</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8AD167A0-777B-4F91-B5B9-F13843B235F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Separation processes</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
