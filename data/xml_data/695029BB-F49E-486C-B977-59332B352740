We walk automatically without the need for conscious attention. However, this seemingly simple task requires very complex control between our body segments, joints and muscles, working together to provide highly adaptable and energy efficient forward movement. What are the basic mechanisms underlying human walking? What are the fundamental control strategies governing human walking. There are still many unsolved questions toward the fundamental understanding of human walking. Most of experimental studies have been descriptive in nature as they are based on measurements, and by its very nature tell us what happens but not why it happens. While mathematical models, which can predict human walking without the need of measurement data, has the capacity to tell us why it happens because the reasons for particular model behaviours can be examined.The aim of this study is to develop a novel computer model to predict human walking using an advanced computational approach, which has great potential for the simulation of large-scale system and has not yet been fully explored. Differing from previous studies, all the body motions and forces exerted on the body during walking will be predicted by only defining walking speed and distance travelled in a stride without the need of measurement data. We will also conduct walking measurements on the same person used for the model construction to thoroughly validate the prediction results of the model. This will go far beyond previous attempts at human walking prediction, creating a highly novel and very computationally efficient model to predict human walking with minimal measurement inputs. A thoroughly validated predictive model would help to answer very fundamental questions underlying human walking and lead to deeper insight into the mechanisms underlying human walking. The predictive walking model would have many important practical applications. For example, for people with movement disorders, e.g. cerebral palsy, the predictive model could be used to fully understand how the change of their body structures affects their walking pattern and therefore will allow clinicians to develop better treatment plans for their patients. Current techniques for assessing artificial limb (prosthetic) design for people those lost their legs are largely based on experimental observations and subjective user feedback. The predictive model could be used as part of a novel computer aided design process for predicting the effects of new prosthetic components on the human walking performance. This would be a significant step toward a more systematic and objective design process, which would help reduce the reliance on the costly and time-consuming process using physical models and human testing. Similarly, this technique can also be used in many manufacturing and military companies who need novel computer aided techniques based on advanced computer model of human walking to reduce expensive physical testing and human evaluation of their products, e.g. sports products, personal load carriage system etc.Our novel computational model will provide a powerful analysis framework for understanding of the fundamental mechanisms underlying human walking and also provide the basis for future computer aided design technique. With its strong links to clinical applications it will also build a new foundation to broadly benefit health and welfare.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Outcomes of this project have the potential to deliver scientific and technological advances that will strengthen the UK's competitiveness in digital human modelling, gait analysis and many other related areas, thereby contribute to the people's quality of life and wellbeing of the UK. Therefore, potential beneficiaries of this project include: 1. Normal People and Patients It has been reported that sustained walking for a period of thirty to sixty minutes a day, five days a week, with the correct walking posture, reduces health risks and has various overall health benefits, such as reducing the chances of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, cancer, anxiety and depression. An advanced human walking model would greatly enhance our understanding of the fundamental biomechanical and physiological mechanisms underlying our walking activities. For normal people, this knowledge would increase the effectiveness and enjoyment of walking as an excise to reduce the health risks, a means of transportation, or even a hobby. For patients with movement disorders (e.g. cerebral palsy) or musculoskeletal disabilities (e.g. amputee), a good understanding of walking biomechanics have the potential to improve clinical diagnostic and management procedures, intervention and treatment programmes, and hence improve their quality of life. 2. NHS Service Providers The potential of the developed methodology to healthcare providers is significant. By integrated with a 3D motion analysis system, it could improve the accuracy, consistency and robustness of the existing gait analysis services, thus assisting clinicians to design more effective treatment strategies. Additionally, it could greatly reduce the requirement of equipments by reconstructing non-measured motions and forces, which is particularly useful for some special patient populations or in a very limited space. 3. Industries In the design of orthotic and prosthetic devices, it is not generally possible to evaluate impact of novel design without subjective assessments using method of human measurements. Computational walking models with predictive capacities have great potential to forecast the effect of prosthetic or orthotic components on the walking pattern, which provides a robust and quantitative alternative to the costly and time-consuming method of using gait measurements. In robotics industry, advanced knowledge of bipedal walking is always useful to improve the current designs to develop humanoid robots that can move as naturally, elegantly and cost-effectively as human beings. There are also rapidly increasing desires from the sports and military industrials recently, to seek a novel computer aided design technique based on predictive digital human models to forestall the expensive physical prototyping and human testing of their products. 4. Other Beneficiaries Many people walk as a hobby, and it is often enjoyed as one of the best forms of exercise. Therefore, the outcomes of this project may be also of great interest to the general public and school children. Additionally, the RA and PI will benefit from the research and professional skills developed from the implementation of the research project. The RA and the PI will collaboratively work on model development, system-level simulation, and project management. The research and professional skills developed could be applied throughout their academic careers.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-01-05</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-03-26</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>99995</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Since early of 2013, we have been collaborating with the clinicians at NHS hospitals at London and Northwest UK and also academics at Salford University, Liverpool University and UCL to explore the clinical applications of the developed computational framework for ankle-foot orthotics and lower limb prosthetic design.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>DD921DA9-7583-4367-B040-9347A3A00EEC</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54524663168cc0.57155628</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>In this project, we have conducted three-dimensional motion analysis measurements of whole-body walking at different speeds. The simultaneous three-dimensional joint rotations, body motions and ground reaction forces and moments were recorded. A large-scale predictive computational human model was constructed with 18 body segments and 23 degrees of freedom to simulate human walking. By validating against the measurement data, the simulation results suggests that the predictive model is capable of representing the joint kinematics and kinetics reasonably well and minimising energy consumption is a key criteria for human neural control during normal walking.
