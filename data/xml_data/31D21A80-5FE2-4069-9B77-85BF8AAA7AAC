It was first articulated by ICISS in its 2001 report. It was adopted by states at the 2005 World Summit and it has been developed by the UN Secretary General in annual reports beginning in 2009. It informed the state response to the Libya crisis of 2011. The value and relevance of the norm has been challenged by international society's failure to establish peace and security in Libya following the 2011 intervention, as well as the failure to prevent atrocity crimes since then, most notably in Syria.
 
In many respects, the UN Security Council's failure in protecting Syria's population can be linked to international society's post-war failures in Libya. For instance, the failure to adequately plan for the post-Gaddafi situation and the failure to commit to a rebuilding programme, contributed to a vacuum that was occupied by political extremists and terrorists. This tainted western leadership, divided the Security Council and contributed to international society's failure to protect the Syrian population.

This critique of western intervention in Libya demonstrates the existence, at least at a discursive level, of a responsibility to rebuild (R2R). R2R is, however, only implicit in the discourse. Indeed attempts by norm entrepreneurs like ICISS to make R2R explicit by identifying it as a requirement of R2P have been rejected by international society. Where the ICISS report understood R2P in terms of three responsibilities - prevention, reaction and rebuilding -, the rebuilding element disappeared from the World Summit Outcome Document (WSOD). This has influenced the direction of R2P scholarship too. Academic work on R2P has been dominated by analysis of the responsibilities to prevent and react. R2R is very much under-researched. Given the how the failures to rebuild have impacted on the support for R2P and for humanitarian intervention more generally, this oversight is not without consequence. 

The aim here to address this gap in our knowledge of R2R. The research will explain why R2R has been marginalised in policy and academic discourse on R2P. It will help us understand the normative and practical implications of that process. The research will involve process and discourse tracing to explain R2R's normative significance. Furthermore, it will analyse those processes against the backdrop of norm-life cycle theory and in a political context where the establishment of a new norm (R2P) necessitated compromises. Finally, it will consider the appropriateness of those compromises. 

To the extent R2P was adopted by states, one might conclude that the rhetorical marginalisation of R2R was appropriate. However, to the extent R2P interventions like Libya have been judged a failure because they failed to properly prepare for the post-war phase, one might counter-argue that the marginalisation of R2R is unwarranted and inappropriate.

In this way, the research will contribute to theories of norm development, as well as to normative arguments that enable the assessment of state practice and foreign policy recommendations.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>While western governments celebrated the overthrow of the Gaddafi regime, they failed to adequately prepare for the post-intervention phase of their involvement. Libya's descent into civil war challenges the narrative of a successful intervention. The outgoing US President Barack Obama for example openly criticised the failure of the key architects of the Libyan intervention, the UK and France, to follow through on their responsibilities (the Atlantic, April 2016). The UK Foreign Affairs Committee (FAC) echoed Obama's criticism, concluding that 'UK policy in Libya before and since the intervention of March 2011 was founded on erroneous assumptions and an incomplete understanding of the country and the situation'. Extending this reasoning, this criticism reflects badly on the R2P norm to the extent it legitimised an intervention by states who seemingly failed to take the responsibility to rebuild seriously. More to the point, the criticism demonstrates the political significance of this research question and the interest policymakers and UK politicians have in understanding the place R2R has in R2P and broader UK strategy. 
 
Different pathways to impact have been identified to ensure that the research from the project informs policy-making. Two different aspects of the policy community will be targeted: policymakers and advocacy groups. Both these groups will be invited to join academics at a workshop on the University of Leeds campus, where the findings of project will be discussed and further pathways to impact developed, including the publication and dissemination of a policy brief. This is addition to a PhD student conference that will deepen these existing networks and encourage a sustainable research agenda in this area. 
 
In terms of the UK policy-making community, I will submit evidence to relevant FAC inquiries, attend the Parliamentary Outreach Service's networking events to raise my profile as a scholar and build contacts with the members of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on the United Nations (focusing on the prevention and resolution of deadly conflicts) by attending the group's activities. This strategy will draw on the experience of researchers at the University of Leeds, including Professor Ralph (whose research was cited in the 2014 FAC report on US-UK relations) and Dr. Gallagher (whose research was cited in 2016 report on the Libya intervention). To reach wider, European policy audiences, I will build on ECR2P's links with the EU External Action Service and respond to consultations. I will build links with the EU-CIVCAP expert network that contributes to the EU Commission's policy-making work by producing analysis and evaluation of the EU's peacebuilding and conflict prevention activities. As an EU-funded project, EU-CIVCAP provides a good opportunity to influence EU policy. 

In addition to benefiting policy-makers, the research can also inform the work of various R2P advocacy groups. The main research users in this regard are organisations such as the Global Centre for R2P, a US-based advocacy group that has briefed the UN General Assembly on the issue and the International Coalition for the Responsibility to Protect, an INGO-based organisation seeking to promote the R2P norm. Working under the umbrella of the European Centre for R2P at the University of Leeds facilitates access to these and its other partner institutions, including the Asia-Pacific Centre for the Responsibility to Protect (University of Queensland) the Budapest Centre for the Prevention of Mass Atrocity, The Hague Institute for Global Justice, and the London-based advocacy group Protection Approaches. 

Successful realization of the above impact strategies is manifested in invitations to speak at events organised by government department or non-governmental organisations, to give advice to policy-makers and civil servants and in references to my research in policy briefs or other documents issued.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>200929</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/P011756/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AB8E72DD-E988-47DA-B01A-BE9012CC89A9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Conflict/War Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EC0E734E-D9A1-463E-AB7A-CCB02E877E10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>International Law</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>28E947B7-D5E4-4F18-9608-1A8534D290F2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Peace Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
