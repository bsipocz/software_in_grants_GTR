Future</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Fellowship</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/P004229/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Through this Fellowship, I aim to develop fundamental scientific methods for the design, optimisation and control of next generation resilient water supply networks that dynamically adapt their connectivity (topology), hydraulic conditions and operational objectives. A dynamically adaptive water supply network can modify its state in response to changes in the operational conditions, performance objectives, an increase in demand and a failure. This is a new category of engineering (cyber-physical) systems that combine physical processes with computational control in a holistic way in order to achieve dynamic adaptability, resilience, efficiency and sustainability.
 Water utilities are facing an increasing demand for potable water as a result of population growth and urbanisation. Cities are reaching unprecedented scale and complexity and the reliable provision of safe water is a global environmental security challenge. New technologies and knowledge are urgently needed to meet environmental, regulatory and financial pressures. Recent advances in sensor and control technologies, wireless communication and data management allow us to gain extraordinary insights into the operation of complex water supply networks and their control. Novel simulation and optimisation methods are required to make use of the new knowledge about the dynamics of large-scale water supply systems and the ability to control their operation in order to improve resource and asset utilisation.
 In the course of pioneering and leading an extensive programme of applied research in dynamically adaptive water supply networks, I have identified fundamental mathematical and engineering challenges of how such complex systems should be designed, retrofitted, modelled and managed in order to address multiple operational applications either simultaneously or sequentially. For example, the network management can be optimised to reduce leakage, improve water quality and enhance incident response. Furthermore, developing a robustly scalable simulation and control system is extremely challenging due to the complexity of the computational tasks for medium to large-scale water supply systems. This research programme will investigate, develop and validate a novel analytical and robust computational framework for the concurrent design, operation and control of adaptive water supply networks that dynamically configure their connectivity (topology), hydraulic conditions and operational objectives. The proposed framework should simultaneously optimise the design (e.g. placements of advanced network controllers and monitoring devices) and the operational control (e.g. the optimal selection of functions and settings for the valves and pumps). This co-design approach also considers the hydraulic dynamics, uncertainties, environmental changes and the development of mathematical optimisation methods for network operability and controllability in order to manage the operation of complex water supply systems efficiently, intelligently and sustainably. 
 This is an ambitious and transformative research programme that requires solving numerous problems spanning several disciplines in water systems engineering, applied mathematics, control engineering, cyber-physical systems and sensors research. The Fellowship will provide me with a unique opportunity to dedicate most of my time to develop, validate and champion into practice the design and control methods for dynamically adaptive, resilient and sustainable water supply networks.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research:
(i) Water utilities (UK and internationally).
(ii) The general public.
(iii) Technology companies.
(iv) All regulatory agencies who interact with the water industry: the Water Services Regulation Authority (Ofwat), the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), the Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI) and the Environment Agency (EA). 
(v) Urban infrastructure systems operators. 

How will they benefit: 
 The water companies will use the developed robust modelling and advanced control solutions to provide unprecedented operational intelligence and system resilience through dynamic adaptability. The resulting knowledge and methods will be applied to: (a) increase the resilience and reliability of supply and respond to regulatory requirements; (b) reduce leakage and bursts; (c) significantly improve efficiency, resource utilisation, water quality and incident response, and consequently sustainability. In addition, this optimal management will extend the life cycle of network assets, reduce total expenditure costs (TOTEX) and save expenditure on new infrastructure. It will also enhance the ability of water utilities to respond to weather extremes such as the flooding in the UK in December 2015 that revealed the urgent need for adaptability and resilience of supply critical infrastructures. 
 The general public (water users) should benefit from the improved quality of service by the increased resilience, reliability and water quality in the supply of potable water. The improved efficiency and resource utilisation should keep bills at current level of affordability. Furthermore, the UK Government forecasts predict an ageing population. This could mean more customers for whom continuity and quality of water supply are becoming increasingly important for their health and well-being.
 Technology companies: The control of dynamically adaptive water supply networks challenges conventional wisdom and may lead to transformative research and radical changes in the operation of water supply systems and the enabling sensing, modelling and control technologies. The smart water systems market is expected to grow from $7.3 billion in 2015 to $18.3 billion by 2020. Consequently, the UK water tech industry will be well equipped to lead the world in the design and control of this new generation of smarter water supply networks.
 The Ofwat Chief Executive has recently called on the UK water companies to think creatively, innovate and be flexible, and also urging them to &amp;quot;think services, think systems; and really understand and manage risk.&amp;quot; A task force was established as part of Ofwat's new strategy and following the introduction of a new primary duty on resilience. In December, 2015, Ofwat released a series of recommendations and activities related to the provision of resilient water and wastewater services that will be carried out over the next five years. Main questions: (a) what do water utilities need to consider in order to provide resilient water and wastewater services?; (b) what does Ofwat need to consider in order to best regulate the water and wastewater service providers, while having regard to its statutory duties and including its new duty on resilience? The proposed research will facilitate evidence-informed regulation based on technological and scientific advances when answering these questions. 
 Urban infrastructure operators: Leaks and bursts have a major impact on the deterioration and cascading failure of urban infrastructure. Urban roads are conduits for water, gas, electricity and communication. Leaks and bursts cause traffic disruptions and costly interruptions for critical services. The operational intelligence, adaptability and resilience that this project would deliver are going to be particularly relevant for urban infrastructure system operators.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1163364</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>88F8DC58-10CF-421D-A5A5-257E9A8E7C5C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Impact of network sectorisation on water quality management</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Hydroinformatics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9435803427e21723a755702bfabeaae1"><gtr:id>9435803427e21723a755702bfabeaae1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Armand H</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5aa8e56b4f5ad5.42503669</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5D45FABC-4572-4513-AF66-69BB56723967</gtr:id><gtr:title>Investigating trade-offs between the operating cost and green house gas emissions from water distribution systems</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Sustainable Energy Technologies and Assessments</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d038fccd9446e616e991388447243e0e"><gtr:id>d038fccd9446e616e991388447243e0e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Menke R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5aa8e5b27f68a3.44469067</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9472184B-4D38-4DF1-B684-BC5E211C1A68</gtr:id><gtr:title>Extending the Envelope of Demand Response Provision though Variable Speed Pumps</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Procedia Engineering</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d038fccd9446e616e991388447243e0e"><gtr:id>d038fccd9446e616e991388447243e0e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Menke R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5aa8e6759a0bd4.98640531</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C6807C70-4F54-4310-A046-7819B2C3E15E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Decreasing the Discoloration Risk of Drinking Water Distribution Systems through Optimized Topological Changes and Optimal Flow Velocity Control</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Water Resources Planning and Management</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/663eaffa6127612ca496238b4cb15af9"><gtr:id>663eaffa6127612ca496238b4cb15af9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Abraham E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5aa8e4e6e2a129.59490246</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B568592D-C45C-4FA4-8CCE-DAD1D5ED331A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Quadratic head loss approximations for optimisation problems in water supply networks</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Hydroinformatics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/110877bde79090f56a0df196628eef2b"><gtr:id>110877bde79090f56a0df196628eef2b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pecci F</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5aa8e613371fe4.98164038</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P004229/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
