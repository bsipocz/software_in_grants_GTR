(NCDs), such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease, are emerging as major health problems in sub-Saharan Africa, including Uganda. To help inform future prevention and treatment for NCDs in these populations, it will be important to identify and understand the risk factors that may influence the development of NCDs in African populations. The overall aim of the study is to assess the patterns and distributions of these risk factors, and their interrelation with infectious factors, in Ugandan populations. Our objectives are to characterise the variation in circulating blood risk factors such as cholesterol, glucose, genetic markers and obesity in up to 15,000 people from urban and rural areas of Uganda. 

The study will help provide a greater understanding of diseases in African populations, informing potential therapies. Importantly, the study will provide estimates of the prevalence of NCDs, such as type 2 diabetes. This information will provide the the basis for health policy and public health programmes aimed at addressing the rise of NCDs in Uganda. It may also inform public health strategies in other African countries.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are emerging as a major health problem in sub-Saharan Africa. Currently, one of the major obstacles in developing appropriate preventative strategies at the national level is a lack of reliable data on disease burden and associated risk factors. The overall aim of the proposal is to assess the epidemiology of metabolic risk factors, and their interrelation with infectious factors, in Ugandan populations.

We will measure metabolic biomarkers and infectious factors in up to 10,000 participants from the General Population Cohort (GPC) study, a rural population-based cohort of around 18,000 people who are followed up annually through demographic socio-medical and serological surveys. Measurements of anthropometric factors and blood pressure will be done as part of the usual survey rounds for the GPC study. We will also measure selected metabolic risk factors in up to 5,000 participants from a national cross sectional study that is broadly representative of the Ugandan population?the AIDS Indicator Survey 2004/2005. This approach will provide the opportunity to compare potential differences between urban and rural study participants for the distribution and prevalence of metabolic risk factors. Given the marked differences in metabolic risk factors among ethnic groups, and using customised genome-wide chip arrays, we will also use genetic epidemiological approaches to provide greater insight into the biological mechanisms underlying the variation in metabolic risk factors in African populations.

This proposal will help provide a unique framework to build on a large scale prospective cohort study to examine a wide range of health indices in an African population?providing the groundwork for long-term study. It will also provide potential aetiological insights into potential determinants of the variation in metabolic and infectious risk factors using both population genetic and epidemiological approaches; estimates of the prevalence of metabolic disorders (T2D, dyslipidaemia and liver dysfunction) in these populations; and the basis for health policy and public health programmes aimed at addressing the rise of NCDs in Uganda, which may also inform public health strategies in other African countries.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>597061</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Oxford</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Genetic Diversity in Africa Project (GDAP)</gtr:description><gtr:id>DA3BF14B-DFED-4E2B-A488-84860870031F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This is a recent collaboration and there is no tangible putput yet however our scientific objectives are to:

Understanding this genetic variation can provide insights into our human origins and the evolutionary processes that shape both human adaptation and variation in disease.[1 2] In these contexts, Africa represents the ancestral birthplace of modern humans.[3] Populations from Africa have the highest levels of genetic diversity.[4 5] This characteristic, in addition to historical genetic admixture, can lead to complexities in the design of studies assessing the genetic determinants of disease and human variation. However, such studies of African populations are also likely to provide new opportunities to discover novel disease susceptibility loci and variants and refine gene-disease association signals.[3] A systematic assessment of genetic diversity within Africa would facilitate genomic epidemiological studies in the region.

The Genome Diversity in Africa Project (GDAP) will importantly extend previous efforts to characterise population genetic diversity in Africa-informing population history and movement, evolutionary adaptation and disease susceptibility across Africa. Importantly, the GDAP will also help develop local resources and research capacity for public health and genomic epidemiological research, including approaches to strengthen research capacity, training, and collaboration across the region. Using a sequencing-based approach, GDAP aims to significantly advance the comprehensive catalogue of human genetic variation in Africa started by the African Genome Variation (AGV) project (African Genome Variation), including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), structural variants, and haplotypes. 

My research team will sequence at low and high depth the whole genome of around 100 individuals from each ethnolinguistic group, and complement these data with 2.5M Illumina array data from distinct regions within Africa. In total, we will aim to sequence up to 2,000 genomes. This resource will extend our understanding of our human origins, population history, and patterns of genetic diversity within and among populations in Africa. Furthermore, it will provide a global resource to help design, implement and interpret genomic studies in Africa populations and studies comprising globally diverse populations, thus complementing existing genomic resources.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>InfCare Swedish Cohort</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Sweden, Kingdom of</gtr:country><gtr:description>EuroCoord Network of Excellence</gtr:description><gtr:id>3620548C-215D-4C4E-8C02-D14C8C0FF239</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We have already collated most samples for the project and analyses are underway.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5464b13b7f8a45.22524440-11</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>EuroCoord partners are grouped into:

My research team genotyped 100 unrelated individuals from each of several ethnic or ethno-linguistic groups on the 2.5 million SNP Illumina HumanOmni chip. To corroborate our analyses we also included whole genome sequences for three of these groups. This work will inform genomic epidemiological studies in SSA by providing a reference for allelic, haplotype and linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure for common variants in populations not covered by the HapMap project. This project has been designed to provide a currently unavailable genome-wide view of common variation and a framework for statistically imputing genetic variants for genome wide association studies in anticipation of future larger-scale whole-genome sequencing endeavours in relevant populations.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>National Institute for Medical Research, Tanzania</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Tanzania, United Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Mwanza Intervention Trials Unit (MITU)</gtr:department><gtr:description>African Partnership for Chronic Disease Research</gtr:description><gtr:id>AF82458D-73C7-4F87-9C14-03D7689B3573</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Two successful grant application have resulted so far from this partnership:

My research team will sequence at low and high depth the whole genome of around 100 individuals from each ethnolinguistic group, and complement these data with 2.5M Illumina array data from distinct regions within Africa. In total, we will aim to sequence up to 2,000 genomes. This resource will extend our understanding of our human origins, population history, and patterns of genetic diversity within and among populations in Africa. Furthermore, it will provide a global resource to help design, implement and interpret genomic studies in Africa populations and studies comprising globally diverse populations, thus complementing existing genomic resources.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Conakry</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Guinea, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>African Partnership for Chronic Disease Research</gtr:description><gtr:id>D5F47313-6B0E-46CD-8D9F-4A9710700781</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Two successful grant application have resulted so far from this partnership:

1. To conduct a pilot study to identify host and viral genetic variants that contribute to control of HIV infection.
2. To develop a research framework for large scale studies in HIV genomics.
3. To replicate findings from the study within the proposed collaboration.
4. To use fine mapping techniques to identify causal variants.
5. To develop a generic research framework to study genetic determinants of other infectious diseases.

This pilot study has been completed and the data are being analysed in the context of other larger collaborations (HIV Eurocord, International HIV Acquisition Consortium (IHAC)).

My research team genotyped 100 unrelated individuals from each of several ethnic or ethno-linguistic groups on the 2.5 million SNP Illumina HumanOmni chip. To corroborate our analyses we also included whole genome sequences for three of these groups. This work will inform genomic epidemiological studies in SSA by providing a reference for allelic, haplotype and linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure for common variants in populations not covered by the HapMap project. This project has been designed to provide a currently unavailable genome-wide view of common variation and a framework for statistically imputing genetic variants for genome wide association studies in anticipation of future larger-scale whole-genome sequencing endeavours in relevant populations.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:department>National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)</gtr:department><gtr:description>HIV Genomics Consortium (HGC)</gtr:description><gtr:id>1DB4CCB4-2E21-4A40-BEA4-D2CC1A70D082</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The specific objectives of 'The HIV Exome Sequencing Study' were as follows:

Understanding this genetic variation can provide insights into our human origins and the evolutionary processes that shape both human adaptation and variation in disease.[1 2] In these contexts, Africa represents the ancestral birthplace of modern humans.[3] Populations from Africa have the highest levels of genetic diversity.[4 5] This characteristic, in addition to historical genetic admixture, can lead to complexities in the design of studies assessing the genetic determinants of disease and human variation. However, such studies of African populations are also likely to provide new opportunities to discover novel disease susceptibility loci and variants and refine gene-disease association signals.[3] A systematic assessment of genetic diversity within Africa would facilitate genomic epidemiological studies in the region.

The Genome Diversity in Africa Project (GDAP) will importantly extend previous efforts to characterise population genetic diversity in Africa-informing population history and movement, evolutionary adaptation and disease susceptibility across Africa. Importantly, the GDAP will also help develop local resources and research capacity for public health and genomic epidemiological research, including approaches to strengthen research capacity, training, and collaboration across the region. Using a sequencing-based approach, GDAP aims to significantly advance the comprehensive catalogue of human genetic variation in Africa started by the African Genome Variation (AGV) project (African Genome Variation), including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), structural variants, and haplotypes. 

My research team will sequence at low and high depth the whole genome of around 100 individuals from each ethnolinguistic group, and complement these data with 2.5M Illumina array data from distinct regions within Africa. In total, we will aim to sequence up to 2,000 genomes. This resource will extend our understanding of our human origins, population history, and patterns of genetic diversity within and among populations in Africa. Furthermore, it will provide a global resource to help design, implement and interpret genomic studies in Africa populations and studies comprising globally diverse populations, thus complementing existing genomic resources.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>HIV Genomics Consortium (HGC)</gtr:description><gtr:id>5B560B38-8518-4578-B45A-BCBDF0E867BC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The specific objectives of 'The HIV Exome Sequencing Study' were as follows:

Understanding this genetic variation can provide insights into our human origins and the evolutionary processes that shape both human adaptation and variation in disease.[1 2] In these contexts, Africa represents the ancestral birthplace of modern humans.[3] Populations from Africa have the highest levels of genetic diversity.[4 5] This characteristic, in addition to historical genetic admixture, can lead to complexities in the design of studies assessing the genetic determinants of disease and human variation. However, such studies of African populations are also likely to provide new opportunities to discover novel disease susceptibility loci and variants and refine gene-disease association signals.[3] A systematic assessment of genetic diversity within Africa would facilitate genomic epidemiological studies in the region.

The Genome Diversity in Africa Project (GDAP) will importantly extend previous efforts to characterise population genetic diversity in Africa-informing population history and movement, evolutionary adaptation and disease susceptibility across Africa. Importantly, the GDAP will also help develop local resources and research capacity for public health and genomic epidemiological research, including approaches to strengthen research capacity, training, and collaboration across the region. Using a sequencing-based approach, GDAP aims to significantly advance the comprehensive catalogue of human genetic variation in Africa started by the African Genome Variation (AGV) project (African Genome Variation), including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), structural variants, and haplotypes. 

My research team will sequence at low and high depth the whole genome of around 100 individuals from each ethnolinguistic group, and complement these data with 2.5M Illumina array data from distinct regions within Africa. In total, we will aim to sequence up to 2,000 genomes. This resource will extend our understanding of our human origins, population history, and patterns of genetic diversity within and among populations in Africa. Furthermore, it will provide a global resource to help design, implement and interpret genomic studies in Africa populations and studies comprising globally diverse populations, thus complementing existing genomic resources.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Oxford</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics</gtr:department><gtr:description>HIV Genomics Consortium (HGC)</gtr:description><gtr:id>8DB9836A-1207-4A88-89AF-95E08A177E03</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The specific objectives of 'The HIV Exome Sequencing Study' were as follows:

1. To conduct a pilot study to identify host and viral genetic variants that contribute to control of HIV infection.
2. To develop a research framework for large scale studies in HIV genomics.
3. To replicate findings from the study within the proposed collaboration.
4. To use fine mapping techniques to identify causal variants.
5. To develop a generic research framework to study genetic determinants of other infectious diseases.

This pilot study has been completed and the data are being analysed in the context of other larger collaborations (HIV Eurocord, International HIV Acquisition Consortium (IHAC)).
