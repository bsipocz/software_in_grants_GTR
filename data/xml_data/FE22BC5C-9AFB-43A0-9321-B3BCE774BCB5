Innovative ways of using your senses to make sense of the Universe</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Fellowship</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ST/L000865/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Cosmology and astrophysics address some of the most fundamental and universally fascinating questions in the whole of science: Where did the Universe come from? What is it made of? What will its ultimate fate be? The public at large are actively engaging with these questions, driven by the curiosity of discovery, and the fascination for the intellectual adventures that our discipline entails. 

As scientists, we are fortunate to be able to tap into such enthusiasm. Astrophysics provides us with an exciting, engaging way to talk about science -- and in particular STFC science -- and its importance for society. 

Interest for astronomy and astrophysics is also one of the most-often cited reasons by students taking up Physics at undergraduate level. The study of the Universe is inspiring, humbling and in short one of the greatest scientific challenges of humankind. 

But by its nature the cosmos is also far removed from our everyday experience. This is part of its mystery and fascination, but it can also become a hurdle when trying to engage the public in a genuine, two-way dialogue. The aim of this fellowship is to create and deliver innovative methods of transcending the old model of top-down communication of science. Better awareness, more genuine engagement and reaching out to a much wider and diverse cross-section of society will be the resulting benefits. 

&amp;quot;The Hands-on Universe&amp;quot; will link the big questions in cosmology and astrophysics with everyday experiences, metaphorically, conceptually, artistically and emotionally. 

What is the Universe made of? How did it begin? How will it end? What is the nature of reality? How does science work? I will create immersive, participative experiences revolving around those and other questions, leading to a more participatory engagement by a larger audience. 

This will help promoting the case for STFC science and its usefulness for society, especially at times of financial hardships. 

The fellowship will comprise the following activities: 

Hands-on activities: Public events focusing on schools with pupils in the age range 11-16, in particular from disadvantaged backgrounds and minority groups, science museums and festivals, aimed at using especially developed hands-on activities to illustrate ideas in modern astrophysics and cosmology in a fun and interactive way. 

Collaborations with artists and musicians: A series of public and web-based dialogic encounters with artists and designers, aimed at exploring the theme of invisibility in cosmology, the perception and description of reality in science and in the arts and the wider significance of research in astrophysics for society. Collaborative work for the production of large-scale installations in high-profile public venues will be pursued. A series of especially-designed interactive lectures, in collaboration with musicians (including amateurs), exploring links and metaphors between cosmology and music. 

Comprehensive online presence: A website with pedagogical material explaining in more details concepts touched on during the live events; video diaries of the events themselves; and online-only content designed to take advantage of the web (social networks, blogs) to create an online community of followers and thus increase impact.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>85172</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/L000865/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
