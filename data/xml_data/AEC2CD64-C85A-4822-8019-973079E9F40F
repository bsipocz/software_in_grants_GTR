The five subject areas covered were:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>?From child-rearing to ?parenting?: what?s new about contemporary parenting culture??;&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>?Gender and parenting culture: Intensive fatherhood??;&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>?Child-rearing in a risk society?;&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>?Changing Parenting Culture: the problems of parenting policy?; and&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>?Pregnancy and pregnancy planning in the new parenting culture?.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>The overall aim of the series was to explore the way that the cultural meaning of ?parenting? has expanded and how it has become an object of expertise and policymaking. Through a series of conversations we hoped to discuss the history and sociology of this development, and its effects for parents? experience and for the workings of specific child-rearing related activities. The series was a great success. The events brought together in a very powerful way detailed study of particular aspects of the contemporary experience of parenting including TV parenting programmes, feeding babies, family planning, and outdoor play, with a wider socio-cultural analysis of the history and contemporary features of parenting culture. Overall the series attracted a diverse group of people, stretching beyond academic colleagues, as research users of a variety of kinds participated as panellists and attended events.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>17324</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The seminar series encouraged wider interest in the concept 'parenting culture' and associated critical engagement with the development of 'intensive parenting' and the problematic regulation of parent-child relationships. This is reflected in the growing number of references to the concept in the years following the seminar series, and on-going dialogue with research users about the problems of the ways parenting culture is configured, expressed for example in the mis-use of neuroscience in early intervention programmes and in over-zealous promotion of breastfeeding.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2010</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>BD95E5CA-B067-419F-83B7-1DF01257FE04</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545262691f3eb7.22977978</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>As this was a seminar series, there are no findings as such. However, the comments below indicate how the discussions were perceived by colleagues who attended, in provoking new thoughts and ideas:

Seminar 1 
'This has been an extremely valuable two days. Well worth attending. The presentations have varied but have all fitted into the overarching aim of this first seminar. It has been useful to be part of an interdisciplinary discussion of research with a common theme. Too often research does get pigeon-holed. Personally, it has really provided me with 'food for thought' and a whole range of issues to reflect upon. I look forward to the forthcoming seminars which I would certainly be keen to attend. Thank you.'

'Rare to have this quality of focus of discussion at a seminar. Excellent!'

Seminar 2 
'Really enjoyed the day and being able to lose myself in hearing such interesting and contemporary debates and ideas (and to remind myself/think through how my own work fits into these) Excellent.'

'The emphasis on current government policy and rhetoric was really very valuable'. 

Seminar 3 
'I think that these series of seminars have been very thoughtful, have built upon each other and have created a really substantial intervention in this area'. 

'We should have more seminar series like this one!'

'Overall the quality of this seminar programme is excellent, the development of the arguments across the sessions and programmes is exactly what should occur in the ESRC seminar series programme'. 

Seminar 4 '
Very thought-provoking and intellectually stimulating sessions! Particularly attractive for students due to free of charge. Access and contemporary discussions!' 

'An excellent series of discussions, which ended in a fantastic venue. Raised so many interesting questions - some of which were answered, some weren't, but leaves plenty of scope to take these topics further'. 

'This has been an absolutely fantastic seminar series - it would be great if you could continue'. 

Seminar 5 

'A fantastic program with wonderful speakers. Very well organised event - thanks to the funders and organisers for bringing the U.S speakers over!'

'As a convenor of a parenting organisation, I think this whole series has certainly informed the deliberation of the public on this issue - it has been very relevant to what parents are thinking and would like to understand more of'

'This was a fantastic conference, interesting speakers and an audience interested in stimulating new ideas around the issues. As a whole the series was fantastic and has made a great difference to my work. It is a great shame it has now come to an end.'

We also did press work through the series, and the coverage draws attention to some of issues raised:
http://www.parentingculturestudies.org/seminar-series/press.html</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The following are comments from non-academics who attended, indicated what they thought was useful about the events:

'For me, attending the first Changing Parenting Culture series was like being hit by a thunderbolt. Suddenly so many of the issues that I'd been considering as a journalist suddenly came in to focus. The research and discussions that occur at the series cut through the buzz of popular notions about parenting and unearth deeper and more philosophical issues related to children and parents. The series helps quantify and examine issues that otherwise remain on the periphery. I've found it an essential critical tool in my coverage and comment about parenting for the Times. Long may it continue.' Jennifer Howze, The Times

'As Information Officer at One Plus One the seminar series was a very useful opportunity to consider current academic thought on the changing parenting culture. I was able to cement some really fruitful links with other attendees as well as disseminate information about One Plus One and the services we provide, particularly in terms of our research and information resources available. I also got lots of details of new references, resources, articles and books to add to our library collection, keeping it fully up to date. The series was timely, relevant, interesting and a very useful information gathering opportunity. Thank you!' Laura Dimmock, One Plus One

[With reference to Seminar 5] 
'The conference was of particular benefit to service providers in that it provided a more 'nuanced' and sophisticated analysis of how women think about pregnancy planning, and decision-makings than is usual. Speakers highlighted the way in which women and their partners might accrue benefit as well as risk to non-use of contraception. This has potential impact on the way that strategies to reduce the number of unplanned and unwanted pregnancies are framed. The discussion on methodology regarding qualitative research - specifically regarding the way women reporting unplanned planned pregnancies 'tell their stories' will be valuable to those looking to analyse feedback from service users, which is increasingly required as a part of Quality Audit. The discussion on the nature of 'stigma' was also valuable to those needing to understand the self-image and self-concerns of service users.' Ann Furedi, bpas 

The observation made most frequently by those who attended the seminars drew attention to their coherence. The concept parenting culture remained the central focus throughout. It was the quality of the programmes - the development of ideas through individual seminars and across the series - that stood out most of all. Scholars from many disciplines presented at/attended events and the value of this inter-disciplinarity was remarked upon through the series, as participants commented on feeling a genuine sense of intellectual excitement and stimulation resulting from the discussion. Early career stage colleagues were involved throughout; more than 10 doctoral students / early career stage appeared on panels over the series. On this basis, the most likely future impact will arise through further consolidation of a new research agenda developed through the series, related to which will be new research and dissemination of ideas about the problems of contemporary parenting culture.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>FD85B5D6-80A7-40A3-8490-262F46A4B157</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-3141033624.4302187762dc90</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://blogs.kent.ac.uk/parentingculturestudies/pcs-events/previous-events/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>28E19978-9AF6-464B-8AC8-A03FBF6F4D4F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Changing Parenting Culture</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Sociological Research Online</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/de00675d77edd860fcb9483c976aa44d"><gtr:id>de00675d77edd860fcb9483c976aa44d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Faircloth, C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545264b8cb6147.24668263</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0C8A5534-DAD5-4CE4-BBF1-90164BE9590C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Risk, health and parenting culture</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Health, Risk &amp; Society</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8033763ccfe8bc587cd808477d8fa410"><gtr:id>8033763ccfe8bc587cd808477d8fa410</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lee E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5452657c5cf5f5.58356671</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F360B777-EDE7-496D-8979-773642EF29A3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Parenting Culture Studies</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d26e897f26091a546d79ed77a2399a41"><gtr:id>d26e897f26091a546d79ed77a2399a41</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lee, E.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-137-30463-6</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>545263c4bba432.27733806</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-451-26-0538</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">RES-451-26-0538</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
