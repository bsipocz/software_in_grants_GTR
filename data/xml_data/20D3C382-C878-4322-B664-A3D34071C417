Sea level is currently rising at approximately 3mm/yr. If we are to understand why it is rising and how future sea-level rise will continue - perhaps accelerate - and lead to a wide range of societal impacts then we need to understand the different contributions to sea level. Some of the largest contributions come from the great ice sheets in Antarctica and Greenland but the amount of ice being lost from Antarctica is particularly difficult to establish. There are three main ways to measure the amount of ice being lost or gained from Antarctica - its 'mass balance'. These are (i) satellite altimetery (measuring very precisely how the ice sheet surface is going up or down through time); (ii) the input-output method (calculating the difference between estimates of how much snow falls on Antarctica, and how much ice breaks off at the coast or is lost by melting); (iii) satellite gravimetry (measuring minute changes in Earth's gravitational field caused by loss or gain of ice in Antarctica through time). 

Ideally, these three techniques would provide similar answers but they currently do not. All the techniques have problems or drawbacks and all are the subject of ongoing research. In this proposal we focus on the satellite gravimetry method. Mass balance from gravimetry is particularly tricky to calculate because the changes to the gravitational field are not only affected by ice loss/gain but also by mass moving around beneath the Earth's crust. At the end of the last ice age, a large thickness of ice in Antarctica melted and the rocks deep within the Earth are still responding to this change 1000s of years later. The consequence of this response - which scientists call glacial-isostatic adjustment or 'GIA' - is that the satellite measurements have to be corrected by a very large amount that accounts for movements of the rocky material and thus to provide the 'real' figure for ice mass loss/gain. It is getting this correction right that has been so problematic because it requires us to know the history of the ice sheet (including past snow accumulation) for over 10,000 years and also to know the structure of the Earth underneath Antarctica. Recent projects including a previous one by our group that was funded by NERC have made substantial improvements in determining this correction but our recently published work has shown very clearly that we still lack data to pin down the GIA correction tightly enough in parts of East Antarctica. In other words there is still an unacceptable level of uncertainty in East Antarctica, which leads directly to uncertainty in sea-level contribution. 

In this proposal we have identified a region called Coats Land, in East Antarctica, which accounts for the greatest remaining uncertainty in the GIA correction but where we have managed to identify suitable sites where we can obtain the necessary ice history information, new seismic measurements of crustal structure, and GPS measurements of crustal uplift (a key part of testing GIA models). By visiting these sites and undertaking some world-leading modelling using our field data and a synthesis of existing snow accumulation data we will provide a new and much improved GIA correction for Antarctica. Whilst our data collection focus will be on Coats Land our subsequent modelling effort will encompass all of Antarctica. The data will be used to develop an improved model of GIA in Antarctica in order to correct the GRACE dataset. We conservatively estimate that with the measurements and modelling that we propose to carry out then we can at least halve the total uncertainty in satellite gravimetry measurements of Antarctic mass balance, and probably do substantially better than this. This proposal raises the prospect of getting an improved estimate of the Antarctic contribution to present-day global sea level rise.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>See Lead Proposal</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>106243</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project is still in the early field studies of the region. Other collaborators are responsible for field geomorphology, cosmogenic dating of deposits, and installation/uplift of GPS stations. At this stage, our contribution is limited to the field acquisition and subsequent analysis of 'mumiyo' deposits for radiocarbon dating to assess aspects such as first occupation of the nest sites which indicates an earliest age of deglaciation of the site (allowing access to the birds to nest).

Pro-ventricular stomach oil (sometimes referred to as 'mumiyo') deposits were first reported in the Heimefrontfjella by Lewis Jukes (BAS) during an over snow traverse from Halley Bay in the mid 1960's. The deposits result from the defensive ejection of stomach oils at nest sites. The oils preserve well in the cold polar environment and can form accumulations up to 20-30 cm thick together with internal layering. 

As with other organic deposits in Antarctica the oils can be dated (by radiocarbon) and together with information about their position, altitude and geomorphological context, can provide valuable constraints on ice sheet history. For example, dating the onset of deposition provides minimum age for deglaciation and by studying samples along altitude transects can constrain the extent of ice thickening at different sites. An additional advantage is that the stratigraphy of individual deposits can be dated at different levels, providing an occupation history that can be used to infer whether glaciers re-advanced over the site (discontinuous deposition) or if the sites have been continuously ice free since the initial deglaciation (continuous deposition).
We found snow petrel nests at al elevations from immediately beside ice margins right up to ridge crests, and it was notable that in areas of suitable boulders we found that virtually all suitable crevices were occupied by active nests or had been occupied at some point (mumiyo deposits). This might suggest that suitable areas are rapidly and intensively colonised once they are available to the birds; moreover the majority of suitable crevices were actively occupied suggesting that there is a reasonable degree of continuity of occupation.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Timing the deglaciation history of Coats Land is of value to ice sheet modellers for contraining their models.

Deglaciation adds to sea level rise - the results are valuable to those studying earlier changes in sea level, and ultimately to policy makers taking decisions about defences against future sea level rise.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A30C0586-9F37-4C07-878F-A0BA3E61BFA9</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56df0eec3f69e8.00249215</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0A98E27A-15E3-4F82-972A-739D162E70DC</gtr:id><gtr:title>A community-based geological reconstruction of Antarctic Ice Sheet deglaciation since the Last Glacial Maximum</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Quaternary Science Reviews</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2087891cd7b3f3507a23e2fc6d44bc8c"><gtr:id>2087891cd7b3f3507a23e2fc6d44bc8c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bentley M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56b9aba017fd67.40841652</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2DA16FD3-7CB4-4916-B067-AA2EAF4F6F55</gtr:id><gtr:title>Sea ice led to poleward-shifted winds at the Last Glacial Maximum: the influence of state dependency on CMIP5 and PMIP3 models</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Climate of the Past</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c95203167c5ba1e3b239c4c7f632d0fb"><gtr:id>c95203167c5ba1e3b239c4c7f632d0fb</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Sime L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58a2ef8ed43aa7.21484067</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>906DF2B3-54E6-42F5-9EB2-385424C7FF65</gtr:id><gtr:title>Changes in Holocene climate and the intensity of Southern Hemisphere Westerly Winds based on a high-resolution palynological record from sub-Antarctic South Georgia</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Holocene</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/318f1deb92756c78c4084e9ab511d907"><gtr:id>318f1deb92756c78c4084e9ab511d907</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Strother S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56b9abeff25374.22015923</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>EA9A7CA4-4386-4D3D-A916-CE06A30BE298</gtr:id><gtr:title>Antarctic ice rises and rumples: Their properties and significance for ice-sheet dynamics and evolution</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Earth-Science Reviews</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/fc9dfb6c3ee69863a0a327b098eb3888"><gtr:id>fc9dfb6c3ee69863a0a327b098eb3888</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Matsuoka K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56b8a096ef53a1.50852357</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/K003933/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>35</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Climate &amp; Climate Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6E910789-6B8D-4B73-B5B0-F3156942B558</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>65</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Geosciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Climate &amp; Climate Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BE94F009-26A1-4E5B-B0B3-722A355F282C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Geohazards</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>07B1BD3F-A7ED-4640-8B09-C1F296DC56BF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Glacial &amp; Cryospheric Systems</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7DCAF586-72E2-4881-9251-E72F38AF1CA4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>5</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Palaeoenvironments</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E32742C9-DE22-4776-82B4-444177FA03AD</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>5</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Quaternary Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
