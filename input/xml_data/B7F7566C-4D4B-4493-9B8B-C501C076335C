People in the UK now live longer than ever before but often in a fragile state of health which affects the ways in which they anticipate their death. While a number of authors have discussed the different ways in which people in the UK approach dying, none have so far used anthropological methods to compare different public arenas where this anticipation of death occurs, or indeed, related it to broader theoretical approaches to witnessing and recognition.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This research focuses on three public arenas:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>the ?right-to-die? debate&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>the laws which regulate people's 'death decisions'&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>a hospice day centre. &lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>This research pursues four objectives:&lt;/p>

&lt;ol>
 

 &lt;li>to offer an analytical and empirical investigation of how different groups anticipate dying by trying to shore up their personhood through attachment to different external forms (law, activism and art)&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>to shed light on the beliefs and motivations of people who want to legalise assisted dying in the UK&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>to advance inter-disciplinary discussion of end-of-life issues&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>to communicate the results of the research to policy-makers, stakeholders, and healthcare practitioners working on end-of-life issues.&lt;/li>

One academic in the audience, Dr Liam Foster, approached me after the talk to ask if I would like to contribute to an edited collection on Death and Social Policy. This edited volume will be published by Policy Press in 2015 and my chapter will be about the 'right-to-die' debate in the UK and internationally.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54636ec5cc81f9.32031231</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academic audiences (collaborators, peers etc.)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>hospice talk (Harrogate)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>36F0B34A-E6D4-4877-962E-E6241F60DD8A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>talk prompted questions and reflection.

In presenting talks at academic conferences (BSA Medical Sociology; Centre for Death &amp;amp; Society Bath) and departmental seminars (Sheffield and the University of the West of Scotland) the findings prompted lively discussion and led to further requests from attendees for information e.g. from the Medical Director of a hospice currently doing research with Prof Daniel Miller on a similar project. I was also asked and agreed to contribute to an edited collection on Death &amp;amp; Social Policy published by Palgrave Macmillan in 2016. I presented on assisted suicide at a hospice which again led to passionate discussion. The information I presented was new to many healthcare professionals attending, although many had their own experience of requests for hastened death. Some commented that my talk had made them think about the issue differently and that they would read the news reports about assisted suicide in a new light as a consequence. The Medical Director of the hospice suggested my findings/analysis was important and should be published so it could influence the debate. I have since published this paper in Medical Anthropology and it has been viewed over 960 times. Presenting about the effects of arts initiatives at two hospice also prompted lively debate and requests for copies of book chapters.

I was contacted by an artist at the Royal College of Art, London to participate in a 'Suicide Walk' to raise awareness of different aspects of suicide and end of life. Members of the public attended the event, along with other researchers (e.g. Izra Black, UCL who looks at assisted suicide from a legal perspective). This walk was filmed and subsequently footage made available on a dedicated website (http://suicidewalk.org) and during an art installation at an RCA exhibition of the suicide walk.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>0572796C-33D5-46F9-A89C-1B54AF3D83A2</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54646f6a3c2fc3.48268917</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This research grant has enabled dissemination of the key findings from my PhD through academic publications, conference presentations, and talks to healthcare professionals. These findings centre on the certainty which an assisted suicide offers people with uncertain end of life trajectories, and the responsibility which doctors are required to assume when facilitating a person's suicide. I also conducted interviews with members of an organisation called the Society for Old Age Rational Suicide. These interviews highlighted that news stories about the poor treatment some older people have received in hospital (e.g. mid-staffordshire) exacerbate older people's fears about what will happen to them when they are at the end of their life. The research also highlighted that some older people do not consider going to Switzerland for an assisted suicide an option for them, preferring to take matters into their own hands at home and finding support amongst their peers for such actions.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>- Findings will feed into research being undertaken by Prof Celia Kitzinger at York University into the views of relatives of people who have had an assisted suicide in Switzerland.
- Findings are feeding into international debates about assisted dying - my work has been cited by Canadian scholars researching the new assisted dying legislation in Canada, and I have been asked to write an abridged version of my Medical Anthropology article for a Norwegian palliative care journal.
- Findings are feeding into a philosophy workshop (Glasgow, March 2017) on Suffering and Autonomy at the End of Life which hopes to feed its more general findings about the value of suffering into end of life care policy in Scotland.
- Published findings will feed into debate around the Assisted Dying (England) Bill and the Assisted Suicide (Scotland) Bill.
- Healthcare practitioners who have listened to my talks might reflect differently on the issue and any requests for hastened death they might encounter in their professional practice.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>DF9A1C31-586C-4690-85A8-4163E8C08E87</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54647b1049bf90.97511658</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.socresonline.org.uk/18/4/26.html</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>CA403ACB-8257-4A7C-B03E-4209CFA29D26</gtr:id><gtr:title>Envisaging Death: Visual Culture and Dying</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c5035a26d9e8a88e090659d90cba3621"><gtr:id>c5035a26d9e8a88e090659d90cba3621</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Richards, N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1443849265</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>544a30cac770f5.20123290</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>45D1D186-B32B-46B7-BEB8-3628230E89F8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Desperately Seeking Certainty?
