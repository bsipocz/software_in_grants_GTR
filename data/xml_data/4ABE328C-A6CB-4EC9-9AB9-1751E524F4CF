&lt;p>&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The primary focus of this Knowledge Exchange project is on increasing the impact of academic thinking on government policy.

The aim is that public policy will benefit from the increased use of academic literature, and that the academic community will benefit from greater interest by users in their work, and greater support and investment in it.

The intention is to build on Bob Butcher's contacts at a senior level in BIS, and his networks across government analysts, and across academia, to create dynamic and effective seminars or workshops and bring together academic thinking with policy priorities.

NIESR has agreed to arrange a series of 4 seminars on BIS policy topics over the 12 months of the fellowship. These will involve experts from the academic community more generally, including ESRC research centres such as SKOPE, and will be open to government officials from BIS and other departments. They are likely to be of interest to Treasury, Cabinet Office, and DWP. The topics are likely to include areas such as macro-economic projections, migration and the labour market, and sources of productivity gain.

Wider impact will be achieved through writing up and disseminating the outcomes of the seminar, including contribution to live policy debates where possible.

Contacts with policy leads will provide material on barriers and opportunities for improving impact on policy (for example some policy people express frustration at insufficient responsiveness from academics and the project can explore ways to address this).

As part of the project we will explore reported frustrations felt by government policy leads in not getting sufficient engagement from the academic community in addressing policy priorities, to understand the causes and assess options and to move the issue forward. For example while there is good macro-research in some areas, there is not a large volume.

The data analysis strand of this project will look at the ONS longitudinal firm-level data and its potential for informing policy in a range of areas, from productivity, through skills, enterprise and innovation. It is a policy-focused piece of work, with implications as much in mind as the exploration of specific research questions, such as the extent of productivity gain arising from churn among firms as opposed to churn among plants or gain within firms. 

An important step for policy leads is that they come to expect and demand an academic literature base in their policy area. The project will encourage that expectation by examples of where public policy in other areas, such as bank independence, exist already.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-01-06</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-07</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>54642</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Impact has been achieved both on academic work, and in non-academic contexts: 

A. Impacts in non-academic contexts are primarily through influence on government policy:

i.. Local growth. There is a renewed focus in BIS local growth policy in productivity as a key aim, prompted by the seminar and associated discussion. Further work with academics is planned. There has also been direct influence on policy development in connection with devolved budgets (the Heseltine agenda) using knowledge developed by OECD through linking them with policy as part of planning for a future workshop.
ii. The future of the labour market and hollowing out. There has been considerable interest among policy makers in this strand of work, as the changes to intermediate pay jobs is of acute political interest and is an ongoing policy concern. Further presentations on this have been provided for DfE Board members and for DWP, with great interest also shown in Treasury. Academics plan further work, and there will be considerable interest from government.
iii. Job creation. Our article led to discussion and some controversy in BIS, leading to further work by policy analysts to understand the labour market part of the productivity puzzle better, and to improve links with academic work in the area.
iv. Access to data. The project achieved new more exploratory access for policy analysts to confidential data in Virtual Microdate Laboratory (VML). This had been seen as very unlikely to succeed when the project started. As a result policy analysts are now developing forward research programmes for analytical work using these data in a range of policy areas including macro-economic policy, labour markets, enterprise and local growth, and skills. An active VML user group has been established, with plans including greater engagement with academics, and widening the user base to policy leads outside of BIS. 
B. Impacts on academic work.
i. Hollowing out and the labour market: We published an article which set out areas for future work of policy interest. These have been taken up by Dr Steve McIntosh at Sheffield University. They include a recommendation to be clear about how to define low paid jobs. Defining them in relation to the median can be seriously misleading, as a real increase in high paid jobs leads to an increase in the median and hence an apparent increase in low paid jobs as the % below two thirds the median then increases other things equal.
ii. Data issues in measuring productivity: Our seminars and discussions have led amongst other things to the generous release to the Secure Data Service by Professor Harris of his series on capital stocks for each firm in the economy. It is now available to academics on request to the SDS. Three separate projects have taken advantage of this and no doubt others will follow.



iii. The article and work on Job creation has led to increased interest and set new standards in the use of the firm level data, on the time-point for the data, and the importance of both the firm and workplace in establishment of new business units. Together with the work on local growth, it has prompted further work on local level job creation.
iv. Our article on academic incentives has created some debate on-line and adds pressure on the economist and social research professions to look more broadly than publication in leading journals for academic achievement.
Other areas of impact on academics include greater awareness of the approaches to measuring productivity, and greater openness and sharing of code in analysing firm level data.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>4527CAC5-8486-474E-969E-E9F9C8295ABF</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54bcf18235cb31.21256764</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1. Summary of project findings

The project undertook to deliver two strands of work: part i) a programme of work on knowledge exchange; part ii) research on economic churn. Both strands aim to improve the impact of academic work on policy.



i. A programme of knowledge exchange activity. 



We led 4 seminars during the year, and other knowledge exchange activities described below. Each of the seminars had a strong audience of policy developers, academics and thinktanks. The 4 seminar topics were:



1. Job creation - how dynamic is the private sector?



2. Hollowing out and the future of the labour market



3. Productivity gain and local growth



4. Issues in analysing firm level data especially for productivity gain.



Each of the seminars has its own website at NIESR, links given in the Research Outcomes website. Two seminars have a linked blog and one a published article. 



We conducted a number of other knowledge exchange activities including



a. A study of incentives for academics to engage with policy relevant work. This yielded some surprising findings about the drivers of academic behaviour, the main barrier probably being the leadership of academic professions. A blog was published. We had intended to investigate separately the barriers in engaging with government research, but were not able to do so as the invitation to tender did not yield a suitable investigator in the time. 



b. Seminar ideas under development, leading to future outcomes:

- literacy and numeracy building on OECD work (leading to a number of events, from February to July)

- International workshop on local development (will be in 2015)

- productivity, based on subsequent outcomes on economic churn

- migration (seminar happened in October, but on a different basis than initiated), and leading to subsequent impact on policy

- improved links between academics and government policy (eg on migration, high growth firms and access to finance, companies House data, basic skills).





ii. Research on economic churn, and improved exploitation of firm level data



1. We undertook analysis of economic churn including job creation and productivity gain. A paper was published in August (link on Research Outcomes), co-authored with Matt Bursnall, BIS. 



Key findings include 

- confirmation of huge amounts of churn in the economy with markedly less after the downturn which could reflect stagnation

- confirmation that a large proportion of job creation comes from establishing new workplaces (two thirds of the total 4 million jobs created per year before the downturn), but that a portion of those workplaces were in existing firms, so that the role of new firms in job creation was lower than that might at first appear, though still substantial.

- recommendation that those undertaking policy development and evaluation pay more attention to the powerful effect of workplaces moving into and out of the economy.



2. We successfully negotiated with ONS and BIS to establish substantially improved access to the confidential firm level data, against the expectations of most people. 



3. Workshop. In order to improve exploitation of these data, we arranged a workshop discussion with leading acadmeics on data issues (see seminar list above).



4. We established a self-managing user group for these data within BIS, with a life of its own beyond this project to maintain access to the data and exploitation of the data within BIS. The user group is already taking action, in line with plans, to link with a wider set of academics and to link across government.



ESRC requirements



There were three specific points the ESRC wanted to see from the project:



? Copies of the outputs of the seminars.



These are provided at items 2, 4, 7 and 8 in the list of publications and outputs



? A short paper on the study, of the link between the dynamic economy and productivity, the labour market and one or more of skills, innovation, high growth firms, sectors and sub-regions, to include aims and objectives, methods and results.



This is met by the published article on job creation at reference 1 in the list of publications and outputs.



? A brief report on the topic of academic engagement with government research, describing the barriers and potential solutions explored.



This is covered by the report at item 5 of the list of publications and outputs.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Here are impacts in non-academic contexts which are primarily through influence on government policy:
