Not only are words and images combined in these situations, but it is often only through understanding the combination of word and image - the information that they jointly convey - that we understand what is being communicated to us. Despite the pervasive nature of word-image combinations in the world around us and our reliance on understanding the information that they convey, little is understood about how we view and understand this class of stimulus. 

Most of our knowledge is limited to how we view and understand words and passages of text or images alone. From these previous approaches, detailed understanding has been developed, and in many ways the manner in which we inspect images and words is very different: with different factors influencing what we look at, and perhaps even different underlying processing styles and cognitive processes when we are reading compared to when we are viewing images. These very different accounts of viewing and processing words and images raise questions about how we gather and understand stimuli that contain both word and image. The proposed work aims to provide key insights into this currently under-developed field of research. 

Three key questions must be addressed to better understand how we inspect and understand stimuli that combine word and image: (1) What strategies do we use to gather information from word-image combinations and do these change depending on the relationship between the words and image? That is, do we vary how we view these stimuli when the relative amount of information conveyed by the words compared to the image changes? (2) How do we understand and respond to space in word-image combinations? Space between words conveys very different information than space between objects in an image. (3) How much information do we process before looking directly at a word-image combination? We process some aspects of words and images in peripheral vision, but the level to which we do so is controversial. 

Comics offer an ideal medium for addressing these three questions because they use word-image combinations to convey a story to the reader, over several panels and pages, which must be understood together for the reader to understand the conveyed information. Critically, it is the combination of word and image in comics that conveys the story to the reader, with neither word nor image alone conveying the entire story in a typical comic, and there exist a range of ways in which the information is distributed between words and image. 

Not only do comics offer an ideal medium for exploring these research questions, but in doing so we are able to use our findings to provide new insights into comics theory. There is a growing research field associated with understanding how we read and understand comics and theories are emerging that relate the manner in which images and words are used when creating comics to the reader's experience in terms of how they view and understand comics. Moreover, these ideas often drawn upon psychological phenomena and theory, yet have not been explored in within Psychological research or with the scientific method that underlies Experimental Psychology. At present comics theories lack empirical testing. Our work will be a first test of the assumptions that underpin comics theory and will therefore offer crucial new insights for this field and help shape the direction that this emerging field takes in the future and in particular will create a psychologically rigorous domain of research for this field.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The primary non-academic impacts of the work are in terms of public engagement with science and psychology and for practice and understanding within the comics industry.We identify 4 groups for primary impact:

1 Public
Most people have at some time read and enjoyed a comic book or comic strip. However, most will not reflect upon the psychological machinery that underpins our ability to understand and enjoy such comics. Comics offer an engaging and relevant medium for explaining the psychology of vision and cognitive psychology to the public. We will use our work to illustrate how the eyes work, how we gather information from our surroundings, how strategic our brains are when prioritising information in the world, and how we can use scientific approaches to understand creative, artistic decisions. The bridge between art and science in the proposed work also allows us to demonstrate how these disciplines can work together for mutual benefit and provide new insights into real world human behaviour.

2 Schools
Comics are particularly relevant to and approachable for school pupils and so offer an important medium for engaging children with science by using them to explain how we read and understand comics. Thus a particular focus of the public engagement impact of the proposed work will be to target school pupils. There is a continued need to promote science and higher education in schools and this work provides an engaging medium for doing so and for demonstrating how science and arts can work together to provide important insights into human behaviour and everyday life.

3 Comic writers/artists
Understanding how the interplay between word and image shapes the reader's experience will provide empirical evaluation of current practice in comic creation. Issues of page layout -between-panel guttering, and challenging panel transitions - will provide key evidence for understanding the consequences of design and composition choices upon reader experience. By linking objective measures of viewing behaviour to subjective measures of memory, understanding and engagement with the stories, our work will provide deeper understanding of how comic creators can shape the reader's experience. Understanding the extent to which panels are processed even before they are looked at will provide new understanding of comic reading and offer new opportunities for utilising this in comic construction. Our work will provide creators with an understanding of how the reader's behaviour can be measured objectively: how psychological methods can be used to measure the consequences of their design decisions. This will allow writers and artists to incorporate these ideas into the planning and pre-production of their work.

4 Comic publishers
An immediate impact for publishers is to understand how between-page layout influences reader behaviour and subjective engagement with comics. Decisions about where to place adverts and how to arrange pages across a comic may have important and unintended consequences for reader experience and the proposed work will offer an empirical basis for making such decisions. Better understanding the relationship between comic design and reader experience will help publishers support and direct comic creators and provide an evidence-based point of dialogue to facilitate understanding between the creators and publishers of work. The proposed work will provide the first set of objective measures of comic reader experience. This offers a potentially important toolkit for the comics industry to measure reader behaviour when viewing comics. The comics industry is undergoing a period of considerable transition, making a move from print to digital comics. There is very little data that publishers can draw on when considering these issues. This project will produce a baseline of knowledge that will be useful to publishers in shaping the technology and modes of delivery of comics.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>286502</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation and discussion at Dundee Comics Expo</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>35A79994-9EB2-4BC7-AA69-73A3B37F695B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Clare Kirtley (postdoc on research grant) gave a presentation of the background to our project, including how the eyes move, how we can use eye movements to test comics theory and how we can reveal insights about how people read and the impact of comic creation choices (about layout, panel format etc) on reading behaviour. This was a formal presentation followed by discussion.

The Twitter feed is in its early days but should provide an important means of widely disseminating our work.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c15b4c351869.85675398</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://twitter.com/eye_read_comics</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016,2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Exhibition and demonstration at New York Comic Con 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DAA56073-69DE-4D41-A8B7-F84EBD5D98A0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>At this major international comics festival, we provided an interactive exhibition and demonstration of our eye tracking with comics project, offering people the chance not only to talk about the work but also to try the eye tracker on and read a comic while wearing it. The purpose of this event was to engage members of the public and comic creators with the utility of eye tracking as a tool for understanding how people read comics and to introduce them to the psychology of vision and the reality of how our eyes sample the world and how we see. We collected names for a mailing list and were asked for further information or the chance to participate in our experimental studies by several attendees. We also used this event to publicise our research project on Twitter.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c159aa599669.12546533</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>A key component and outcome of this project is the impact activities associated with this work. 

As detailed in the Impact Plan we aimed to use the work to engage adult and child audiences and have been involved in a variety of public engagement activities in order to achieve this aim. These activities include exhibiting and providing interactive demonstrations at international comic conventions (including New York Comic Con in the US), two science festivals and a literary festival. Dr Kirtley has also given public talks on our work in this project. Of the public engagement events, three have been aimed specifically at children (Aberdeen Cultural MayFest, Superheroes vs. Monsters, and the launch of after school comic clubs at the Dundee Comics Space). We were part of the two-day workshop and discussion group events that marked the launch of the Dundee Comics Space, which is run by the two co-applicants on this project award (Murray and Vaughan). Murray and Vaughan have also been heavily involved in public engagement through running the Dundee Comics Space over the last year and this has also been an avenue for engaging the public with our project and with surrounding issues about the interplay between science and art in comics. Our aim to use our work on comics to engage the public with the link between science and art, detailed in our Impact Plan, is evident from the range of public engagement contexts that we have been involved in: including both science and literary events. 

We have met with comics creators to discuss the aims of our project and potential of our research approach for application to comics. As a result, we are developing several contacts with local and international creators. Recently, we have been creating commentary tracks: videos of artists work being eye tracked, along with audio or written commentary by the artist or writer, about their planning behind the page, and their expectations regarding how their stories would be read. These videos and commentaries are being made available on our project website, as a way of introducing visitors to a sample of eye tracking, and demonstrating how such measures are useful to creators. These links are useful not only for producing these materials for public engagement but also for generating materials and questions for further research. 

In addition to information about the project on the Active Vision Lab website, we have created and are using a dedicated project website at: https://comicsconventionsproject.wordpress.com as specified in the Impact Plan. This website will grow in content as we progress through the project and will be an important means of widely disseminating the findings of our work. We have also set up a project Twitter account @eye_read_comics which we are using to further disseminate our work and as a forum for discussing the psychology of comic reading.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>520C05C2-A54B-4D9D-A47B-9AAC7C74CE02</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56defa79710748.27617839</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>An early key achievement of this award was the creation, in collaboration with professional comics artists, of a set of 6-8 page stories for use in experiments. These stories all contain a critical panel that was created in 6 different versions to include carefully controlled variations in the distribution of information between words and images I the critical panel. No exiting set of comics contains this carefully controlled manipulation of content, which will allow controlled experimental study of the effects of differential distribution of information between words and images. 

All data collection has been completed for Experiments 1, 2, 3 and 5 of the proposed research and we have run follow up studies arising from Experiments 1 and 2 in order to explore findings from these experiments. Key findings are that viewing behavior is influenced by (1) information distribution between word and image, (2) expertise in comic reading and drawing and (3) whether the panel is presented in isolation or as part of an ongoing story. Data from Experiments 1 and 2 and the follow up studies form the basis of a substantial publication currently in preparation that will be submitted to a high impact journal. 

We are on track for our originally-proposed time schedule for the experimental work in this project.

Work conducted as part of this project has highlighted a number of issues for further research in this domain. Some of these have formed the basis of experiments we have run using voluntary research assistants. Others will form the basis of future funding applications.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The data we collect will provide the first database of eye movement behaviour while reading comics, or indeed any other word-image combination stimulus set.
