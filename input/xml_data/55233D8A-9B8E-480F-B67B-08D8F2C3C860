The dominant narrative is that from the middle of the nineteenth century until after the Second World War, the family was a stable unit organised around a core nuclear or extended unit headed by a married couple. It tends to be assumed that the decline in marriage and multiple family forms are a recent development which can be attributed to the increase in divorce, remarriage, co-habitation and single parenthood since the late 1970s. For example, a recent policy document from the Children's Society claimed that in the past two centuries paid work for mothers has dramatically increased, children are cared for by someone other than their parents and that there is a rise in 'family break-up'. Both the emphasis of the report and subsequent media coverage accord with the common contemporary refrain which bemoans the decline of marriage, the break up of the 'traditional' family and the negative effects of women working, developments which are all seen as relatively recent. Yet the historical evidence of the past few centuries for Western Europe suggests that because of death, desertion and separation, marriages have been far from stable, the structure of the family has been fluid and complex and children frequently may have been looked after by someone other than their parents. Moreover, in Scotland divorce has existed since the Reformation, irregular marriage was legally valid until 1939 and co-habitation with repute until 2006. By providing a long -term historical perspective on the nature of marriage and the family, the project will focus on the complex nature of changing cultural patterns and values. A better understanding of the historical dimension of marriage will help us to interpret the present by avoiding simplistic and over-generalised views of change and continuity in marital and family relationships. An awareness of the variability and complexity of parental partnerships and marriage relationships in the past will help to interpret current patterns and also to formulate future policy options. \nThe research will be both qualitative and quantative and will be based on a variety of sources, including archival, judicial, newspaper, representational and oral. The outputs will benefit the academic community of social and cultural historians, sociologists and those in social policy. The results will be disseminated through a variety of means including conference and seminar papers, academic journals and a published monograph. Outputs will also include databases of household information which will be deposited in the UK Data Archive. In conjunction with Teaching and Learning Scotland we will also produce an e-pack for use in schools. A website based on the project will also be developed. We intend to disseminate our results to the non-academic community by making our working papers available to organisations including the Centre for Families and Relationships, SAY women, Scottish Women's Aid, the Women's Support Group and the Glasgow Women's Library and by posting them on our website. In addition, we intend to host two one-day workshops aimed at relevant practitioners, policymakers and researchers, an international colloquium and an exhibition of the project's findings for a public audience. \nThe proposed study seeks to fill a serious gap in the social and cultural history of Scotland and therefore Britain. It will also inform international historical debates about marriage and the family. The project will provide sound empirical evidence about the nature of working-class marriages and family in the past in the belief that a better understanding of their historical roots will aid in interpreting the present and in formulating policies for the future. \n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Establishing the pattern of family structure, courtship, marriage and marriage breakdown in Scotland's past will contribute to public debate in an important policy area and increase public awareness of the value of long-run historical analysis of issues of contemporary importance. It will also contribute to policy consultations and inquiries which resonate with key policy objectives and will therefore help communities and societies respond to major issues surrounding family and family breakdown. As members of the International Centre for Women and Gender Studies we have links with Child and Family Policy Units and Child and Family Abuse Studies Units including Scottish Women's Aid, SAY Women, the Women's Support Group and the Centre for Research on Families and Relationships,[CRFR], one of our partner organisations. The CRFR produces high quality collaborative research relevant to key issues in families and relationships. It acts as a network for researchers and stakeholders with an interest in research on families and relationships. The CRFR also ensures that this research is accessible for use by policy makers, practitioners, research participants, academics and the public and it has been consulted on policy by the UK and Scottish governments. Partnership with the CRFR will enhance our ability to disseminate our research on family life, marriage patterns and family breakdown which can help shed light on the causes of current problems as well as pointing in the direction of new solutions by ensuring that practice, policies and research are based on sound empirical knowledge of the past rather than on the false assumptions which so often permeate contemporary discussions of the family. \nThrough our membership of the Centre for Gender History we established links with the Glasgow Women's Library, [GWL], who agreed to be one of our partners. The GWL engages with the media, academics, vulnerable women and policy-makers. It also provides life-long learning. Thus collaboration will also widen our impact market. We have also established links with Scottish Women's Aid who have agreed to act as a facilitator for organising workshops to discuss our findings. We will keep stakeholder organisations involved throughout the duration of the project by disseminating working papers. At the end of the funded period of our research we will hold a one-day conference aimed at practitioners, researchers and policymakers to be hosted by the CRFR. As well as being a forum to disseminate our findings, a longer term aim is to use the conference to encourage future collaborations between historians, policymakers and practioners. Along with Teaching and Learning Scotland, with whom we are in discussion, we will construct e-learning packs on marriage in historical perspective and a database of household information for use in schools. Local historians, local history societies and community educational groups including the Workers Educational Association and Continuing Education, with which we have strong links, would also find this material useful.We will also create a website from the project which will be of interest to family historians, genealogists and the Scottish diaspora. This will be modelled on and linked to the existing 'Scottish Way of Birth and Death' website (http://www.gla.ac.uk/departments/scottishwayofbirthanddeath/), which already attracts around 1000 hits a month across the world and publicity on family history blogs. The website will also hold a film production on the history of marriage in Scotland[we will seek independent funding for this] as well as visual and sound track materials from the oral history interviews. These sources will be used in the exhibition that we intend to hold in the final year with our partners in the GWL. We also aim to air the film at the Glasgow Film Theatre. We will exploit our media links with BBC Radi</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-04-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>791844</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Team member Jeff Meek acted as historical consultant and interviewee for this BBC Scotland documentary charting the experiences of lesbian and gay Scots from the post-war period to the present day.</gtr:description><gtr:id>DC1D7EBD-08B6-4A98-8028-8C231DA084DB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Increased interest in the project's engagement with LGBT experiences and research.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>567159ab5fb483.08106502</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>BBC Documentary, Coming Oot!
