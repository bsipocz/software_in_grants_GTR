The population in these conflicts is unable to access healthcare, as clinics are shelled, physicians are arrested or forced to flee, medication is unavailable or unaffordable, and sometimes the trip to the doctor is simply too dangerous. Under such circumstances, a case of pneumonia is a deadly illness. Conflict zones become hotbeds of disease as cholera, polio, and other illnesses resurface that were previously eradicated from the region. The relentless refugee streams further export these healthcare risks. The breakdown of healthcare moreover has repercussions for the population long after the conflict has officially finished. It takes years to rebuild infrastructure, and train staff. Moreover, the population's health has suffered in the meantime. When they need to be at their most resilient to rebuild their country, their physical and mental health is at its weakest due to years of neglect. 

This research seeks to draw attention to local health workers, who bear the brunt of attacks. They are the last ones standing, when MSF and others are forced to leave. However, they are rarely topic of research. My research focuses specifically on the challenges they face in different conflict contexts. It is an interdisciplinary, comparative study focusing on the importance of the conflict context they are active in for threats on health workers and medical infrastructure. This has been singled out as an urgent research gap in our knowledge on medical neutrality, the protection of the medical sector in conflict. Taking the conflicts in Ukraine, Syria, and Egypt as the main case studies, I will answer the following questions: What strategic roles do local health workers occupy in different conflict contexts, and how does the realisation of these roles affect adherence to immunity by external actors and impartiality among health workers themselves? Under what circumstances are attacks more likely to occur, and how can threats be mitigated? 

This project uses a new interdisciplinary approach, drawing on social movement theory. Through this, previously unexplored activities and characteristics of local medical networks can be researched, such as their alliance-building strategies and recruitment activities. Moreover, the research project provides a more structured, in-depth study of the case studies than in previous studies on the question. In doing so, it provides some much needed answers that can inform policy making and research agendas, directly improving support for local health workers, and indirectly for the embattled local population.

The project seeks to strengthen collaborative relations among policy makers and scholars, and incorporate local health networks into this fold. In doing so, it contributes to the creation of a collaborative network for knowledge exchange focused on local health workers and their patients. This will ensure the relevance of the research, and strengthen policy making with recommendations that are tailor-made for their situation. A specialized conference /workshop and at least four publications in academic journals are planned, in addition to publications specifically aimed at local health workers containing best practices. The project has furthermore a clear goal of informing the broader public of this phenomenon, in the shape of specifically targeted publications and a website.

In addition, the project allows me to build crucial research skills and knowledge exchange skills. During the project, I will take courses on some of the research methods and technologies that are of increasing importance in my field, such as sophisticated data gathering systems, big data, and quantitative analysis. I will also take courses that will teach me how to better communicate interdisciplinary research projects and its outcomes to an academic audience.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The main beneficiaries of this project are local health workers, who are active in conflict or during periods of political unrest. They are the primary and often the sole provider of healthcare to an embattled population. However, only recently we have started to look into the position of local health workers, who are unaffiliated with international organizations. Legally, local health workers find themselves in a difficult situation, as their medical activities are sometimes (illegally) criminalized. Politically, they are considered as key assets, and be pressured to break medical ethics. Socially, they may find themselves in a role of community leaders, asked to take up non-medical tasks as well, resulting in the rise of ethical dilemma's. This study sheds light on the challenges that set them apart from other health workers, such as staff of international humanitarian organizations, based on in-depth interviews and analysis of (social) media reports.

The project culminates in several products, among which a brochure that is directly tailored towards local health workers in conflict situations. It allows for sharing best practices on the set-up of field hospitals, generation of supplies, and organization of volunteers. Local health workers active in the different case study countries and elsewhere can access the website or receive the hard copy brochure through international health organizations. 

The study also informs the policies of international organizations such as ICRC, MSF, OCHA and WHO, who support and collaborate with local health workers. National policy departments in health and international development, such as DFID and its foreign counterparts, benefit from knowledge on the plight of local health workers as well. By showing how different conflict contexts affect their activities and position, this research informs more tailor-made approaches in supporting these health workers among the aforementioned organizations and policy makers. By doing so, it fills an important research gap in public health, identified by both scholars and policy makers (Bellagio declaration, 2013). Moreover, it fine-tunes a research approach that is well-suited for the study of the activism and behavior of both formal and informal groups in times of political contention. This approach is replicable in other conflict contexts and humanitarian crises as well. Organizations such as MSF and SAMS, will be consulted in the research design stage, during the execution of the research, and at the dissemination stage. 

In the short term, the project increases information on the activities, challenges, and strategies of local medical networks in different conflict contexts, which will be informative for the health workers themselves and for international organizations active in public health and humanitarian assistance. In addition, it aims to increase public awareness of the plight of local health workers through news paper articles and lectures targeted at the broader public. Although particularly striking excesses receive attention in the media, such as attacks on Ebola teams, the pressures local structures face on a daily basis mostly go unnoticed. In the medium term, the study seeks to stimulate the use of more innovative and robust research designs that might strengthen the evidence-base of analysis, by fine-tuning a method that is sensitive to different contexts and therefore well-suited for replicability elsewhere. In the long term, it contributes to more evidence-based policy making and a differentiated approach towards the support of health workers in various types of conflict. 

The human costs of a breakdown of the medical sector are enormous, both during the conflict and afterwards. Moreover, the repercussions of such a breakdown, as visible in the polio outbreak in 2013 in Syria, can endanger an entire region and beyond. Protecting the medical sector in conflicts should therefore be a top priority.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>162228</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N015754/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4511FB20-8392-418E-809D-7701FACC03C9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Law &amp; legal studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AB8E72DD-E988-47DA-B01A-BE9012CC89A9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Conflict/War Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F6A8697C-69DA-4020-8D45-9901CA002827</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Global Health and Medicine</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B33D3534-9854-416D-9412-CB4F732D0410</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol.,International Rel.&amp;Dev.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5455CCD0-BA52-40F6-8DAE-1BA1063EE624</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B75590D5-E385-45F1-B6D0-CC3EDEFDE67D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Socio Legal Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
