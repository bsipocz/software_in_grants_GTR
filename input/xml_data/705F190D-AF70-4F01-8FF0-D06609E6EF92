Advanced thermal processes like gasification, in combination with exploitation of lignocellulosic (woody) waste can lower the carbon footprint of the energy production sector. 
When forest or agricultural residues (e.g. cereal straws) are fed raw or mixed with other fuels into fluidised bed gasifiers (FBGs), operational problems like ash fusion and bed agglomeration appear. This is a result of the undesirable interactions of some of the ash constituents (alkali and alkaline earth metals) of woody waste with silica sand, which is the most common bed material of FBGs. Under the operating temperatures of wood gasifiers (&amp;gt; 850oC) eutectic mixtures are created, the bed agglomerates and can even cause shut down of the energy production units. 
To ensure efficient operation of FBGs fed on woody waste, this kind of feedstock needs to be pre-treated in order to remove those problematic elements and ensure long term operation without disturbance.
The problem of how to optimise the physicochemical properties of such new types of solid biofuel can be solved by integrating traditional pre-treatment techniques (leaching) with novel chemical engineering concepts (microwave extraction).
With support from Energy Works (Hull) Ltd, this multicultural and interdisciplinary team of researchers from the UK and EU, will develop a novel microwave pre-treatment technique as a solution to the bed agglomeration problem when wood waste is to be processed or co-processed in FBGs. 
The proposed pre-treatment process emerges from the integration of a traditional and already proven successful pre-treatment method (leaching) with a novel one (microwave extraction). It aims not only to optimize the specifications of the solid biofuel, but also to address the challenges facing future development of a practical and affordable pre-treatment system.
By in short term co-feeding and in the long term by running efficiently with woody waste,this new process will allow the conventional energy production sector to meet its sustainability criteria. Development of the microwave enhanced leaching process of woody waste with ionic liquids like water is the primary target. This will enable stabilization of the woody waste properties and optimize operational behaviour in FBG energy production technologies. In this way also an underestimated biomass 'waste' source of the UK will be upgraded to a highly desirable solid biofuel.
The key element of the novel process is the integration of the microwave irradiation with the traditional leaching pre-treatment of such waste. Water leaching has been proven efficient in removal of the alkali and alkaline earth metals and sulphur elements from woody waste. It is however time-consuming and resource intensive (solvents). Microwave extraction techniques on the other hand have been proven to reduce extraction time, use less solvent, or even none for high moisture materials. Thus integration of both techniques can lead to improvement in waste pre-treatment for solid biofuel production.
The new pre-treatment technique is still not well understood in terms of microwave mechanisms and requires fundamental studies to allow scaling-up for commercialization. The present proposed project will develop a new generation of leading UK academic researchers focusing on a multi-disciplinary problem-solving approach and with a powerful commitment to train our future engineers accordingly.
It will also complement the recent 22 Conference of Parties (COP22) Marrakesh agreement to put forward the practice of COP21 Paris decisions for large scale energy production via less CO2 emitting technologies like woody waste gasification.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>During and after the project national-international partnerships between relevant partners/stakeholders will be encouraged and promoted. This will enhance the research capacity, knowledge and skills of people, organizations and businesses. Reports on biomass waste availability and sustainability aimed at the general public, open access publications and presentations of results all form part of the project's deliverables. These can be the basis of further R&amp;amp;D and lead to exploitation of scientific knowledge to strengthen other international cooperation within and out of the EU economic area. This will be also attempted by interactions through the international dissemination events and continuation of the ongoing research collaborations for common new research initiatives and projects. This will contribute to wealth and economic prosperity by attracting investments from global markets. The project will promote production of cost-effective renewable solid fuels to supply the national energy infrastructure: from SMEs to residential buildings and traditional energy production plants. It will support the current UK and EU policies for waste minimization, resource efficiency, RES embodiment in the energy sector and CO2 abatement. In order to raise public awareness and engage future stakeholders outside of the cluster created by this project, contact will be made with those capable of influencing planning and development of the project's methods and technologies. These include waste authorities and environmental agencies, local authorities and governmental agencies which influence energy resource management and operations in UK. All the above parties will be also invited to take part in any of the workshops and seminars organized under the frame of the project. The role of this research in leading to the development of new jobs within the broader RES sector should also not be underestimated. 
Dissemination of the project results will be fulfilled by several actions including: articles, journal publications and public reports communicating the results, challenges, benefits and opportunities of the project idea, presentations in national and international cross disciplinary conferences, seminars for young scientists which could all bring forward the new learning material and thematic area of interest. Other forms of communication in the UK and EU wider audience will reach a new generation of scientists and also inform a wider audience. These include: a website, Facebook group, personal contacts with public and environmental organizations, NGOs, academia, enterprises, associations of entrepreneurs, agricultural corporations, consumer associations. In that way all the interested parties will be able to participate actively and introduce their ideas, give feedback enabling the current and future generation of engineers to acquire desirable skills of real problem solving for the benefit of the society, the economy and the environment. Introduction of the social community and businesses to the sustainable aspects of this project will enable upgrading of current UK agricultural, trade and manufacturing practices giving an ultimate benefit: the sustainable use of waste and sound environmental practices in UK energy production. The UK's welfare, cohesion and energy security will be enhanced. All the above will contribute to an increase in scientific and public awareness in the field of RES bioenergy and understanding of the related socioeconomic benefits.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>99778</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P034667/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F95121C7-7C31-40CE-BDBC-1E2BF025AEA6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Energy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>68D4AB6A-88C3-4368-8A94-2DADEEF21FF5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Bioenergy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
