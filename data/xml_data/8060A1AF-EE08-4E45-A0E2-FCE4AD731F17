Groups arise as a way of mathematically describing symmetries which occur in nature: these could be obvious symmetries like those in crystal structures, or less obvious symmetries such as those inherent in equations describing the world around us. Groups were invented in the 1800s by a French mathematician called Galois as a way of describing when it is possible to solve polynomial equations, but before long the theory of groups started finding applications across mathematics and science. The &amp;quot;algebraic groups&amp;quot; in this proposal arise classically as groups of matrices acting on some space of coordinates (and are hence strongly related to groups used in physics), but other approaches to these groups have developed over the years. A key advance was made by another French mathematician, Jacques Tits, when he invented objects called &amp;quot;buildings&amp;quot; in the late 1950s. These buildings are highly complicated symmetric objects which break up into very simple pieces (think of a complex molecule like DNA, made up of relatively simple building blocks); the pieces are easy to understand individually, but the way they fit together gives rise to some extremely rich and beautiful mathematics. Tits showed that every algebraic group has attached to it one of these buildings and, conversely, a certain class of buildings naturally have attached to them algebraic groups. The close relationship between buildings and groups allows one to translate problems in group theory and related topics into to problems about buildings, and vice versa, and this process is one of the key themes of this proposal. 

The question at the heart of this proposal has been around since Tits invented buildings and concerns the possible ways that symmetries of a building can move the building around. It is perhaps easiest to describe with an example. Imagine a sphere, whose group of symmetries consists of all rotations and reflections which leave it looking the same; for example, we're allowed to rotate the sphere about any axis through its centre. If we now colour the top half of the sphere and just look at the symmetries which preserve this colouring, then we see that such symmetries will in fact fix the north and south poles. This is a special case of Tits' conjecture, which states that the symmetries of a building preserving certain colourings should have at least one fixed point. A solution to Tits' conjecture would be a major step forward, and not just in pure group theory. The conjecture unifies several important areas of mathematics under one umbrella, and exposes deep connections between results which on the surface appear unrelated. For example, buildings can be used to encode what happens when you change your number system (eg., when you work with complex numbers instead of real numbers); they can describe some aspects of representation theory, which is a vital tool in physics and chemistry as well as mathematics; they can exhibit the possible ways that a given group can act by symmetries on a given space. The mathematics in this proposal has two main aims: first, to use the context provided by Tits' conjecture to develop new connections and results within group theory and other related areas; second, to exploit these connections and different points of view to give a novel approach to proving Tits' conjecture. Both these paths offer the possibility of exciting and innovative new mathematics which will be of interest and use to a wide variety of mathematicians and, through them, a wider audience of scientists and practitioners.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research, and how will they benefit?

Beneficiary: &amp;quot;UK plc&amp;quot;
How: The proposed research is at the cutting edge of a vibrant area of pure mathematics in which the UK has a strong international reputation. This project would help to ensure that the UK remains at the forefront of this area of mathematics, enhancing the country's global reputation for excellence in scientific research. Although the primary purpose of the planned overseas travel in the proposal is pure academic research, there will also be benefits to the wider scientific community in the UK in reputation and profile and in our ability to influence research abroad as well as at home. The planned visits of overseas academics to the UK will have a similar impact, increasing the view globally of the UK as a place to come to do excellent work, and which contains institutions and bodies which are able to support and foster excellence. 

Beneficiary: The wider public, specifically schools
How: The PI Bate has a track record of outreach work in local schools, being part of the department's outreach team and participating for a number of years in the &amp;quot;York Children's University Taster Week&amp;quot;. He has also recently registered as a STEM ambassador, which reflects his commitment to disseminating his research beyond traditional academic boundaries. His particular interest lies in enthusing younger children, although his work is not necessarily limited to any particular age-group. Successive UK governments have recognised the importance of STEM subjects to the future prosperity of the UK, and enthusing children at an early age by engaging them with exciting and innovative mathematics should be seen as a key role of this generation of academics.

Beneficiary: Training elements 
A substantial part of the funding requested will go towards the employment of a postdoctoral RA. The early career researcher will have access to a world-class department at York, with a vibrant community of working mathematicians, and the planned travel components will give them further opportunities to expand their horizons and kickstart their academic career. The grant will also help PI Bate to further establish himself as a leader in his discipline in the UK, helping him to attract more PhD students to York who will also benefit from the research opportunities generated by the project.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>298192</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Newcastle University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>School of Mathematics and Statistics</gtr:department><gtr:description>Collaboration with B.

Although we kept to the original research plan laid out, having had success we also had time to branch out into other related topics. In particular, the PI and RA have begun a project in the representation theory and invariant theory of reductive groups, and the PI and three of the VRs have begun a project looking at pseduo-reductive groups. Many of techniques and ideas developed in this grant will contribute to these projects. As the papers resulting from this project make their way through the publication process, I anticipate that other academics around the world will begin to adopt the ideas we have developed too.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D891DCD5-F206-4E0A-A8B8-9ADED296F36E</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5459e7f5cb3633.99340741</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://pure.york.ac.uk/portal/en/michael.bate@york.ac.uk</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0F406474-1DFC-41B5-AC11-BCE96FA62469</gtr:id><gtr:title>Composition
