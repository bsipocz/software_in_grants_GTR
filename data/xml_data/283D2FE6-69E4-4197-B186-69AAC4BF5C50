Chiang Kai-shek was arguably one of the most divisive leaders in twentieth-century Asia: worshipped by his supporters within the Chinese Nationalist Party and its allies, yet demonised by his many enemies in Japan, China and Taiwan. While questions of how Chiang was depicted were largely ignored in scholarship emanating in the 1980s and 1990s, Chiang has become the focus of intense academic, media and lay attention over more recent years as his legacy is reappraised and new sources relating to his life become more accessible.As yet, however, virtually no work has been done on the ways in which Chiang was visually depicted by his detractors and enemies - despite his ubiquity in Japanese wartime propaganda on the Asian mainland, communist Chinese media and propaganda during the Chinese Civil War and the immediate post-1949 period, and in publications by exiled Taiwanese pro-independence activists in the 1950s and 1960s. This project seeks to fill this gap in the literature. Building on my extensive work on positive depictions of Chiang created through the Chiang personality cult, and incorporating many of the new methodological approaches that are being pioneered by scholars of Soviet visual culture, I seek to examine the following research questions:- How did visual depictions produced by enemies or critics of Chiang change and develop over the decades, and can we trace the development of specific tropes in these depictions?- Who specifically created such depictions, and how did their images of Chiang influence the work of other artists and propagandists?- To what extent, and in what ways, were certain ideas about China and the Chinese Nationalists projected onto representations of Chiang by his detractors?- Is it possible to learn anything about the reception of such images amongst their perceived audiences in China, Taiwan and elsewhere?- What can a cultural history of 'anti-Chiang' propaganda contribute to wider scholarship on representations of twentieth-century dictators?The fellowship will result in the completion of two journal articles (one to be submitted to Modern China, the other to Art Journal), one magazine article (in Chinese) and the establishment of an on-line image bank (of negative or satirical depictions of Chiang by various different artists) at Sheffield's Humanities Research Institute.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>While two of the stated outputs arising from this fellowship are academic journal articles (one of which has an area studies readership, and the other an art history readership), I also plan to make the research undertaken accessible to a much wider lay audience. This will be done by writing a more lay-focused essay to be submitted to the magazine 'Lishi Yuekan' (Historical Monthly) - a Taiwanese publication comparable with 'History Today' (see http://issue.udn.com/CULTURE/HISTORY/). This will bring the research to a much wider, non-academic audience in the Chinese-speaking world. However, it is primarily in the production of an on-line image bank at Sheffield's Humanities Research Institute, which shall be designed to be used by people beyond academia (school teachers, museum curators, amateur historians) where the project will have its most substantial impact. As well as including images collected from various sources in the course of the fellowship, the image bank shall include features such as suggestions for further readings on representations of Chiang and comparable figures in twentieth-century history, and 'significance statements' for selected images. It is my particular hope that the image bank will be utilised by users in East Asia itself, and to this end I intend to include bilingual features on the site. In China and Taiwan, Chiang Kai-shek's legacy continues to stir substantial public debate, and I see this project, via the image bank in particular, as having an impact on this debate by moving it beyond the current focus on the visual residue of the Chiang Kai-shek personality cult, or the wider fascination with the recently opened Chiang Kai-shek diaries.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-06</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>75611</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Contribution to 'Modern History Review' (magazine published by Hodder and aimed at secondary school students)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DF0BA62A-4C78-43DD-93C4-229B95C97BA5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The article 'Chiang Kai-shek (1887-1975): revolutionary or dictator?' was published in Volume 17 (3) of Modern History Review (Hodder Eduction), February 2015.

Research was undertaken at institutions in the UK, China, Japan, Taiwan and the United States. The project enabled me to produce an open-access collection of images of Chiang was the use of other scholars, students, museums and members of the public to use. 



The main contributions of the project, outlined in a number of conference and journal articles which have already been published (or are in the process of being published), included the tracing of a number of tropes (and their origins) used in negative images of Chiang across many decades. In particular, my work has proven that many of the standard ways in which Chiang Kai-shek was denigrated by the Chinese communists in the postwar decades can be traced back to the work of Japanese and Japanese-supported artists during the Japanese Occupation of China. I was also able to link the rise of specific technologies and techniques (e.g., newsreels, photojournalism etc), in China with the rise of the Chiang Kai-shek personality cult in the 1920s and 1930s, and to demonstrate how these same technologies were used by Chiang's many enemies, in some cases many decades later, to undermine his legitimacy.



The project's findings will thus contribute to academic debates about the visual depiction of dictators, the creation of propaganda, and various other fields and debates.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>It is my hope that the on-line database will prove to be of use to lay users, and particularly people working in the museum and creative arts sector.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>9DA501C2-19B0-4325-A38F-4849789D905F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-3160988765.91863977604ba6</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/chiangkaishek/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>An open-access and searchable database of images, drawn from various sources, of Chiang Kai-shek, together with introductory essays and other relevant materials</gtr:description><gtr:id>D5112710-6930-4CFE-9650-EBDFEE97EE79</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The database is now used by a number of history and Chinese Studies departments across the UK in its UG curriculum</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>543696824ad7a7.99690798</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Enemy of the People: Visual Depictions of Chiang Kai-shek</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/chiangkaishek/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2012</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BBC841A7-8634-46AD-A37C-D82FE66A4048</gtr:id><gtr:title>Cartoons and Collaboration in Wartime China</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Modern China</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4a209535e7da79b5d62367bda05695b6"><gtr:id>4a209535e7da79b5d62367bda05695b6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Taylor J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56d95e78941077.54855277</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9C0A6553-7531-41E2-865D-4199AB0D2FA3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Republican Personality Cults in Wartime China: Contradistinction and Collaboration</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Comparative Studies in Society and History</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4a209535e7da79b5d62367bda05695b6"><gtr:id>4a209535e7da79b5d62367bda05695b6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Taylor J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56d95ed46ddf68.77568663</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0E1EED1B-145E-4E8D-88E4-27AB93CC80B4</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Sinification of Soviet Agitational Theatre: 'Living Newspapers' in Mao's China</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of the British Association for Chinese Studies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/80b4e288f428a9222fe7187e1d4352aa"><gtr:id>80b4e288f428a9222fe7187e1d4352aa</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Taylor, J E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5436954d3a8dc3.12811306</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I026944/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:parents><gtr:parent><gtr:id>283D2FE6-69E4-4197-B186-69AAC4BF5C50</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>AH/I026944/1</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>75611.0</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2012-02-06</gtr:start><gtr:end>2012-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:children><gtr:child rel="Transfer"><gtr:id>1B7BA077-B46D-4DA3-AD95-91EBE0E1B191</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>AH/I026944/2</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>15658.52</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2012-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2012-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:children/></gtr:child></gtr:children></gtr:parent></gtr:parents></gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
