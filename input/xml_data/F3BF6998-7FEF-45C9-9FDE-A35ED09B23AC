It is believed that the Big Bang started off in a condition of almost pure energy, and as this energy turned into matter, the laws of physics that we currently understand would have produced almost equal amounts of matter and anti-matter. But astronomical observations yield the clear conclusion that the Universe consists almost entirely of matter. This means that there must be laws of physics that treat matter and anti-matter differently, such new laws of physics would also violate time-reversal invariance, i.e., they would make the interactions of particles different depending on whether time is moving forwards or backwards. Laws of physics which have these properties usually induce a static electric dipole moment to the neutron (or nEDM), and hence a search for an nEDM is a search for the physics that could explain the matter-anti-matter asymmetry.
Notes: 
1. These projects are not awards in themselves. They are a mechanism to capture outputs common to the project (usually, but not exclusively, publications). 
2. Each project has a number of contributing research teams, based at multiple institutions. The research teams are funded through the institutes? consolidated grants. 
3. It is not possible to quantify the proportion of effort that each research team contributes to the project.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2030-01-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>0</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Rutherford Appleton Laboratory</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Particle Physics Department</gtr:department><gtr:description>CryoEDM</gtr:description><gtr:id>7267E887-9EF2-48A1-8EDF-93CE7F49197D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Papers: doi 10.1016/S0168-9002(02)00391-1, 10.1016/S0168-9002(02)00391-1.

The program involves members of the department at all levels, from taught undergraduate and postgraduate students, research students, post doctorial researchers and faculty. We have a wide range of practical activities available to take out to local schools, which are boxed up with a detailed lesson plan for department members to take to take out or use on site. The majority of our outreach activities are linked to our research.

Our annual reach is to 5,000 students per year, working with approximately 800 primary school students, 3500 secondary student, and 700 A-level students, in addition to the 2,000 members of the general public that experience our events. We currently run 130 events per year, reaching school and college students at 60 different schools. We have both schools visiting the University of Sussex campus in Brighton, and we also go out to schools.

Around half of our events involve communicating the research carried out at the University direct to schools, colleges and the public.
25% of our events involve describing our particle physics research, usually consisting of a research talk (about the Large Hadron Collider, SNO+, etc) which is reinforced by practical activities (such as building cloud chambers, or visiting our research labs). 20% of our events directly describe the astronomy research carried out at the University, usually as a research talk (about the Herschel Space Telescope, for instance) alongside practical activities, such as day-time or night-time astronomical observing.

Every week during the school terms, we run a School's Lab day, where a group of students visit the University for as full day of experiments specifically designed for the GCSE, AS and A2 level syllabus. During those days, the students visit a research lab, and get the opportunity to talk with our research students about their work. In addition, visiting A-level students also have a research lecture, and get to here the latest research being done here at Sussex.

Every year, we offer masterclasses in both astronomy and particle physics, with one day aimed at GCSE students, and another at A-level. These days involve research-level talks, visits to labs, as well as hands on experimental experience.


We have developed links with local schools and colleges. Teachers frequently approach us to request research related outreach activities (talks, lab tours, practical activities), ask for advice or to borrow equipment for teaching. In 2013, we ran the Institute of Physics sponsored Physic Update weekend conference for teachers.
Since we began our outreach program, undergraduate numbers has risen significantly within the department, from an intake of 40 students in 2009, up to the current (and</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5334510feccfc5.86025072</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:presentationType>Keynote/Invited Speaker</gtr:presentationType><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.sussex.ac.uk/physics/outreach</gtr:url><gtr:year>2009,2010,2011,2012,2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This grant funded development work towards one of the most precise and exquisite measurements that it's possible to make in physics: the search for the so-called Electric Dipole Moment (EDM) of the neutron. This is a tiny distortion of the structure of the neutron (a subatomic particle), perhaps a billion times smaller than anything that LHC is capable of detecting. It is critically important for helping us to understand the origin of all of the matter in the Universe - including all of us, and the stars and planets - since the size of this subatomic distortion is intimately related to the question of the difference between matter and antimatter, which led to our Universe being matter-dominated. We use a sort of atomic clock to study the behaviour of neutrons in strong electric fields, which allow us ever increasing sensitivity in the measurement. This work aimed to operate the &amp;quot;atomic clock&amp;quot; in liquid helium, which should have allowed us a huge increase in sensitivity by using (amongst other things) higher electric fields, but although there were some important advances, e.g. in understanding processes of high-voltage breakdown in liquid helium, the project was too ambitious for the small UK group to carry alone.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The fundamental work that we have carried out - demonstrated superthermal neutron production; 65% polarisation in helium, with clear path to improvement; neutron transport to and from storage cells; substantial advances in magnetic shielding; reliable operation of solid-state neutron detectors in LHe; detailed systematics studies - is of use to others in the field, both in the development of long-term cryogenic EDM projects, and also (in the case of systematics studies) in understanding issues with currently running EDM projects e.g. at PSI. It is possible that the HV breakdown work may be of broader interest to industry.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>1CCF0C37-7D30-4975-8B63-3CE5DEE2C5B3</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544f7b0c7ee5e5.47469808</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E15E50B7-4E0C-4C4A-8233-23CB122D8062</gtr:id><gtr:title>Gravitational
