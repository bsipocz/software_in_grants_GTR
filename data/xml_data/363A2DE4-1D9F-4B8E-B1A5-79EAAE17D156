Auctions - economically speaking, any mechanism involving structured, competitive bidding - provide a simple, transparent mechanism by which to allocate goods and services, particularly in environments where bidders have potentially idiosyncratic tastes over complex or heterogeneous objects. Consequently, auctions are ubiquitous in a wide range of applications of practical and policy interest: online platforms such as eBay, housing and auto markets, corporate control markets, and markets by which public agencies procure essential goods and services, among others too numerous to name. This in turn has motivated extensive academic research on auction design and performance, yielding insights relevant both for private individuals and companies participating in auction markets and for public agents and agencies entrusted with oversight of public procurement.

While the literature has made tremendous progress in understanding auction markets, empirical research to date has focused on two broad paradigms: standalone single-object auctions and multi-unit auctions for many identical objects. Unfortunately, these paradigms say little about a problem widely encountered in applications: how should a policymaker allocate many different objects, especially when bidders view objects as complements or substitutes? One common solution to this problem is to run many separate sealed-bid auctions, with bidders competing for many objects simultaneously. Auctions based on this design are widely seen in public procurement applications, including markets for highway maintenance contracts in most US states, snow-clearing contracts in Montreal, recycling services in Japan, cleaning services in Sweden, oil and drilling rights in the US Outer Continental Shelf, and waste management in Italy among others. In such cases it is known that bidding for multiple objects can create &amp;quot;exposure problems&amp;quot; which substantially distort bidders' strategic incentives, potentially leading to much worse revenue and efficiency outcomes than would be predicted by the standard single-object model. Yet despite the prevalence of simultaneous sealed-bid auctions in a wide range of policy-relevant applications, virtually nothing is known about the scope of such exposure problems in practice. 

In this research, we study how interaction between auctions in applications such as highway contracting affects revenue and economic value created in procurement markets. Toward this end, we first develop an empirical model of bidding in simultaneous sealed-bid auctions, to our knowledge the first such in the literature. Crucially, this model supports estimation of the degree to which bidders view auctioned objects as complements or substitutes, a critical parameter for policy design in multi-object auctions about which virtually nothing is presently known. Our model is applicable in a wide range of public procurement settings, including those listed above. To illustrate our proposed methodology, however, we focus on a single application for which data is widely available: highway construction and maintenance contracts auctioned by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT). We apply our model to estimate bidder preferences and cross-project synergies in the MDOT market, with preliminary results suggesting that bidders view small projects as complements and large projects as substitutes. Building on these estimates, we aim to provide new insight on two objects of substantial policy interest: to what degree current practices maximize value and minimize public-sector costs in the MDOT market, and whether other possible multi-object formats (e.g. simultaneous ascending auctions) could improve outcomes in this market. We thus aim to provide new insight on optimal design of multi-object auctions, helping resolve an important class of policy questions arising in a wide range of procurement contexts.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Public procurement is an important tool by which the UK and other governments maintain infrastructure, acquire services, and advance other economic and social objectives. To ensure efficient provision of public services, the importance of evidence-based design of procurement markets is therefore hard to overstate. Auctions have long been a central tool by which policymakers seek to promote efficiency, maintain transparency, and minimize costs in public procurement markets. In many settings of policy interest, it is common for policy makers to allocate and bidders to compete for many objects simultaneously. Such cross-auction interaction can radically alter welfare and efficiency realized by the auction, especially in first-price auctions where bidders cannot update bids as the auction proceeds. Yet very little is known about the revenue and efficiency consequences of cross-auction interaction in practice, particularly in first-price auctions.

Our main objective in this project is develop a framework for empirical analysis of simultaneous first-price auction markets, which will allow a policymaker to learn not only how bidders value objects in isolation but also how they value various packages of objects together. Our research will impact design and analysis of auction markets in at least two important directions.

The first major impact of this project will be methodological: by developing a general procedure for empirical analysis of simultaneous first-price auctions, we aim to equip both researchers and practitioners (various national and local government organizations, such as sectoral ministries, concessions promotion commissions, municipalities, district councils, local councils, etc.) to understand the role of cross-auction interaction in major procurement markets. E.g., if bidders' costs are found to exhibit strong positive synergies, then the potential &amp;quot;exposure problem&amp;quot; in sealed-bid bidding due to simultaneous bidding is likely to be more acute than that in open-bid bidding. Our approach will support estimation of policy-relevant primitives based on standard bidding data. We will thereby provide novel insight on a number of important policy questions which can be addressed only within a simultaneous framework: for instance, the severity of the exposure problem, whether bidders should be allowed to bid on bundles, and revenue and efficiency gains from employing other potential multi-object mechanisms. We believe the main reasons research in economics has ignored these questions to date are the complexity of theoretical analysis of simultaneous bidding and the lack of a tractable empirical framework for analysis of simultaneous first-price markets. The proposed project will provide essential methodological impact on both issues, thereby supporting a much richer set of policy analyses than heretofore considered. 

The second major impact of this project will be on policy design. We plan to illustrate how, based on estimates of bidders' demand for various packages of objects, a policymaker can evaluate social efficiency losses in the realized equilibrium, estimate the sellers' revenue in the total surplus, find optimal reserve prices, measure the extent of the exposure problem which is notoriously present in auctions of multiple objects, and analyse whether the bidders should be allowed to bid on bundles. We also hope to explore relative performance of other auction formats, such as sequential or combinatoric auctions. Such an analysis would yield new insight on several important auction design questions and may suggest changes in existing procurement policy. E.g., it may help determine the criteria on the properties of the group of auctioned objects under which the auctioneer should be allowing bidding on bundles to achieve greater social efficiency, or help design the optimal auction format under constraints on the allocation of objects.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>296087</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>ASSA meeting</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1D66B23F-D49F-4B10-9A77-DB1966134CF3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The ASSA Annual Meeting is the largest gathering of economists in the world.

Specifically, in practice most real-world procurement agencies seek to allocate many procurement contracts at once, and in principle the contracts so allocated may be perceived as either complements or substitutes by potential counterparties of the procuring agency. We seek to understand how the simultaneous auction of multiple contracts affects both contractor and procurer outcomes in such large-scale procurement markets.

Toward this end, in the course of this grant, we have developed three major findings. First, we develop a new set of analytic results on efficiency in simultaneous auction markets, showing that while such markets can converge to efficient outcomes, such convergence is guaranteed only under relatively strong assumptions on the economic environment. This leads us to expect that potentially important inefficiencies will be present in most real-world applications.

Second, we have developed a set of empirical models permitting quantification of the degree of inefficiency present in a given market based on real-world bidding and allocation data. The main challenge involved in this analysis is estimation of potential synergies between allocated contracts; since in most cases bidders cannot bid on multiple contracts jointly, this is typically not revealed directly in the data. We show how analysis of the market as a whole, plus strategic interaction between participants therein, can be used to shed light on synergies not directly revealed by bids on individual contracts. We then translate these observations into a practically feasible model estimable on real-world data. 

Finally, we apply this methodology to explore potential inefficiencies in a representative large-scale procurement market: in our case highway procurement contracts allocated by the U.S. state of Michigan. Although our estimates suggest the presence of economically important synergies between auctioned contracts -- which as noted above may induce substantial inefficiencies -- we also find that in practice the simultaneous allocation mechanism is surprisingly efficient, realizing almost 95 percent of potential economic gains. We view this as encouraging evidence that simultaneous auction markets can in fact approach the performance of far more complicated, but theoretically efficient, combinatorial mechanisms such as those used to allocate broadband spectrum, suggesting that policy efforts should focus on efficient packaging of contracts to be auctioned.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>While the methodology we develop opens the door to empirical analysis of previously infeasible policy questions regarding large-scale procurement markets, there are still a number of ways in which this methodology could be refined. In particular, by leveraging techiques from big data and machine learning, future research may be able to estimate substantially richer economic models than considered by us. This in turn would permit richer and more nuanced policy conclusions. 

Additionally, while we apply our methodology to one representative market (highway procurement contracts in Michigan), the questions we explore also arise in many other policy-relevant markets. In future research, our methods could be put to use to study similar allocative / efficiency questions in other large-scale procurement markets where synergies or diseconomies between allocated objects are expected to be present.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E39B42BC-E301-4A35-9EF3-125807D63147</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56deee9d77ae02.84960952</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Construction,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2514995</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Motivated by the empirical prevalence of simultaneous bidding across a wide range of auction markets, we develop and estimate a structural model of strategic interaction in simultaneous first-price auctions when objects are heterogeneous and bidders have preferences over combinations. In this model, bidders have stochastic private valuations for each object and stable incremental preferences over combinations, nesting the standard separable model as the special case when incremental preferences over combinations are zero. We establish non-parametric identification of primitives in this model under standard exclusion restrictions, providing a basis for both estimation and testing of preferences over combinations. We then apply our model to data on Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) highway procurement auctions, quantifying the magnitude of cost synergies and evaluating the performance of the simultaneous first-price mechanism in the MDOT marketplace.</gtr:description><gtr:id>1E959552-7C02-4A54-9ADB-9FADA21F20AF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None so far</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c94e8d3b5862.78970848</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Estimation method of preferences for simultaneous actions.</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2514995</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N000056/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>19539613-8143-4CD6-B1E5-0C7B93D08B7D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Behavioural &amp; experimental eco</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5A4E8C76-15D3-44F2-9A84-72ADCE4DC97D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Econometrics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>50992D59-4D34-4EAD-9A21-B3ADAF426DA1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Industrial Organisation (R&amp;D)</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
