This work will be made in response to the investigation of a site on the rural/urban edge of Kyoto: the site of the artist's residence in Japan 15 years ago which has since been demolished. During a ten-week period based at Kyoto Arts Centre the artist will undertake an investigation of the site. Investigative material will be in the form of traced drawings, maps, photographs, film, casts and found object collections. Work in progress will be exhibited in the North Gallery of Kyoto Arts Centre and the project will then be developed in the U.K. The final output will be in the form of a group of 'reproducible collages' in which processes of collage construction will be combined with those of image reproduction including tracing, etching, silkscreen and digital printing. The aim is to produce works which parallel, rather than illustrate, models of memory which relate to conventions of discontinuous time. The body of work will be developed towards solo exhibition in the U.K. and documented and contextualised through a project publication. The project will be located within the context of contemporary fine art practice that is concerned with issues of time, place and memory.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-01-24</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-09-25</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>21088</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>1.
