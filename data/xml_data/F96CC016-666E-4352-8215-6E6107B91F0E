exploitation of the James Clerk Maxwell telescope (JCMT) after September 2014, when STFC are currently planning to
cease being the operating agency for the facility, and hand it back to University of Hawaii. We propose to take a roughly
25% share of time with the East Asian Observatories (EAO) being the lead operator, and Canada also taking a smaller
share (TBC).
EAO are committed to operating JCMT for an initial period of 5 years; we are committed to a contribution from our own
resources of &amp;pound;300k pa for 3 years and we are here requesting matched funding from STFC for the same period. In addition
we request a small amount of travel funds to allow UK astronomers to spend time working with the EAO scientists in
Hawaii.
The UK financial contribution will allow it to not only gain access to a proportionate (smaller than the present 55%) share of
observing time but actually to continue a leading role in the major surveys and targeted observations currently being
undertaken at a fraction of the current cost to the UK. This is because the EAO see the operation of JCMT as a way to
develop the skill base of their own communities and to benefit from the enormous expertise of the UK community.
Therefore the baseline plan is that all partners will put 50% of the total observing time into survey programmes defined and
exploited by joint science teams. The UK community will thereby gain access to at least 62.5% of the total science output of
JCMT at a total cost of ~&amp;pound;1M over 3 years compared to a similar fraction at present as the major partner at a total cost of
around &amp;pound;2M per year</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The JCMT has a very strong history of impact in public outreach, and this will continue under the new operational models.
The UK has a stronger track record in outreach than the other partners and is likely to play a leading role in this area.
The public has a very positive view of astronomy research which draws benefit into all science areas, and also helps to
attract young people to study STEM subjects at school and University.
Because this is a collaboration with the 4 east Asian partners of Taiwan, China, South Korea and Japan it enables UK
Universities and scientists to develop closer ties with strong research institutions in these 4 very strong economies. Ther
are strong opportunities for student exchange, both outward for UK students and inwards for Asian students coming to
learn in the UK having seen the positive outcomes of the research being conducted.
UK PhD students and early career researchers will also have the opportunity to work with cutting edge technology, both in
terms of hardware at the telescope and software in analysing the data. There is significant opportunity for this training to
result in spin out activity in other areas, for example the UK creative industries in the case of software, and for imaging technologies with the hardware.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>403240</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The involvement of the UK community in shaping the new programme for JCMT under EAO has allowed the UK to leverage a level of leadership and involvelment in the new larghe survey programmes far above its percentage contribution level.
