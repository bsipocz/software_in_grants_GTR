It causes superficial infections such as thrush, an irritating infection of the vagina or mouth, which affects over three quarters of women within their lifetime. It can also cause life-threatening blood stream infections in a variety of hospital patients including those on chemotherapy, suffering AIDs and those recovering from organ transplants, other surgical procedures and major burns. Mortality associated with these infections can approach 50 % even with treatment, which is higher than a wide range of bacterial infections including MRSA. A striking feature of C. albicans is its ability to grow and switch between a variety of structural or morphological forms. These different forms are often seen in samples from patients and the ability of C. albicans to switch between growth habit is known to be important for its ability to cause disease. In this project we will study the mechanisms that result in forming the different morphological forms, specifically concentrating on the genetic control of cell division which is a key difference in the range of morphological forms. This will provide important insight into how the different morphologies are formed and how cell separation is regulated. Additionally throughout the work we will also endeavour to identify new targets for the development of antifungal drugs.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Candida albicans is the most common opportunistic human fungal pathogen and causes a variety of clinical infections ranging from superficial to life-threatening systemic infections. A striking feature of C. albicans is its ability to grow in a variety of morphological forms including yeast, pseudohyphal and true hyphal forms, and the ability to switch between these morphological forms is linked to virulence. The cellular differences between the various morphological forms include the extent of polarised growth, nuclear migration, position of septation and ability to separate after cytokinesis. The control of these processes must be linked with the progression of the cell cycle. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae the exit from mitosis, entry into cytokinesis and cell separation are controlled by the Mitotic Exit Network (MEN) a GTPase regulated kinase cascade. Preliminary data suggests a similar pathway is present in C. albicans, however, it also raises questions on the role of this pathway and suggests it may act earlier in the cell cycle and be involved with yeast-hyphal morphogenesis. This project will address the role of the mitotic exit network in C. albicans and aims to reveal its regulation and function in the different morphological forms. The specific aims of the project are to assemble a collection of null or conditional mutants of MEN components in C. albicans. These would then be fully characterised through molecular genetic and cell biology approaches in order to establish the role of MEN in C. albicans. The spatial and temporal regulation of the components will also be visualised by 4D live cell imaging and the identification of protein-protein interactions. The data generated will lead to the complete understanding of the MEN in C. albicans and identify its potential role in the process of morphogenesis.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-04-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-04-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>359467</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The main achievement of this work was in the dissection of the mitotic exit network in the human fungal pathogen Candida albicans. Through this work we have demonstrated that, in addition to the network being essential for mitotic exit, it is also required for cytokinesis and cell separation and plays a role in morphogenesis. These activities can be separated indicating that the network plays multiple roles, and these roles are differentially modulated in the various morphological forms of C. albicans. We have also clearly demonstrated that the pathway is not a simple linear signalling cascade; rather it is branched with for example Tem1 and Cdc15 signalling mitotic exit through other factors. In addition the components of this network play differing roles in cytokinesis through their regulation of both septin and actinomysin ring activity. Therefore this pathway, although fulfilling similar functions, has diverged significantly from that seen in other model organisms.

In order to facilitate the range of studies to undertaken in this work we developed a new set of cassettes for epitope tagging and over-expression analysis in C. albicans. Genetic manipulation in C. albicans typically uses auxotrophic markers, however the range of markers available can be limiting. We developed a set of new PCR-mediated tagging cassettes incorporating the nourseothricin positive selection marker; in particular these included the GFP, YFP, CFP, RFP and V5-6xHis epitope tags. In addition we constructed a constitutive over-expression system that we used for protein functional analysis and in studying genetic interactions through an epistasis-based approach. These cassettes have expanded the range of molecular tools currently available for working with C. albicans, and they may also be used in other fungi that display sensitivity to nourseothricin. The construction of validation of these cassettes has been published and they have been made freely available to other members of the research community.</gtr:description><gtr:id>4F269A93-E831-4AC0-953E-BD5A0D1EC532</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-875081411.446520677825188</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Candida albicans demonstrates three main growth morphologies yeast, pseudohyphal and true hyphal forms. Cell separation is distinct in these morphological forms and the process of separation is closely linked to the completion of mitosis and cytokinesis. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae the small GTPase Tem1 is known to initiate the mitotic exit network, a signalling pathway involved in signalling the end of mitosis and initiating cytokinesis and cell separation. We have characterised the role of Tem1 in C. albicans, and demonstrate that it is essential for mitotic exit and cytokinesis, and that this essential function is signalled through the kinase Cdc15. Consistent with its role in activating the mitotic exit network Tem1 localised to spindle pole bodies in a cell cycle dependent manner. Cells depleted of Tem1 displayed highly polarised growth but ultimately fail to complete cytokinesis and re-enter the cell cycle following nuclear division. At the transcriptional level genes downregulated following the depletion of Tem1 where significantly enriched for genes whose expression peaks early in the cell cycle and for those associated with glycolysis.



For expression analysis triplicate RNA samples were generated from exponentially growing C. albicans yeast cells and from cells following 8 h inhibition of TEM1 expression. Gene expression was determined using RNA-seq on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform.</gtr:description><gtr:id>EFB72CD1-351D-4E2C-B309-77FF09140AC0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>No actual impacts realised to date</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-9635032890.02462666d775ce</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>GSE48650 - Expression analysis of Candida albicans following a block in mitotic exit</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>In order to facilitate the range of studies to undertaken in this work we developed a new set of cassettes for epitope tagging and over-expression analysis in C. albicans.
