The ISSP is one of the most important attempts at undertaking cross-national survey research that currently exist. Originally started in 1985 by research teams from Australia, Great Britain, the United States and the then West Germany, its membership now extends to 45 teams from countries that between them cover all five of the inhabited continents. Its aim is to facilitate in depth study of cross-national variation in attitudes towards subjects of global importance and interest. The British data is collected as part of the British Social Attitudes survey, carried out by NatCen Social Research.&lt;br />&lt;br />The aim of ISSP is not simply to visit one topic and then move on to another. Rather it is that topics should be revisited on a regular basis. This means that the programme not only provides a means of examining cross-national differences at one point in time but also cross-national differences in trends over time. Over the next three years ISSP will address three topics. In 2013, it will field a module of questions about national identify, following on from earlier work in 1995 and 2003. In 2014 it covers citizenship, following on from work in 2004. And in 2015 it will revisit role of government, building on earlier work in 19858, 1990, 1995 and 2006.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The primary beneficiaries of this project will be social scientists, both in Britain and internationally, with an interest in conducting cross-national research. The data collected as part of ISSP will provide them with a unique resource (see section on Academic Beneficiaries and Case for Support for further details). 

Academics will readily be able to access the British data through the UK Data Archive whilst the full cross-national data set will be made available via the ISSP website and the ZentralArchiv fur Emprische Sozialforschung (ZA), University of Cologne. As in previous years, full documentation will be provided along with the data.

The importance of the data set to academic users is reflected in the large number of publications using ISSP data. In Britain alone, over 400 publications using ISSP data have been recorded (Britain was the 3rd highest contributing country after the USA and Germany). Use of the British data is of course far greater than this figure suggests, as they are used in a wide range of publications generated outside the UK (the worldwide total for known publications using ISSP data stands at 5,225). Further information about ISSP publication trends can be found at www.issp.org/page.php?pageId=150. 

We are committed to a wide range of dissemination activities to ensure that the ISSP data collected are widely known about and used within the academic community. These include:
- Giving presentations on ISSP to appropriate audiences (the Principal Applicant has recently given talks at an ESDS International Datasets event, and a special event organized by NatCen, City University and ESDS, which focused on ISSP and the European Social Survey) 
- Ensuring information about data releases appears on relevant academic list-servers
- Publicising findings by including chapters based on ISSP data in the annual British Social Attitudes report. For example,
- the 30th Report (2013) will include a chapter on gender roles and family using questions asked in the 2012 survey. The chapter will make use of the long time series of data we have for this module, which was also asked in 2002, 1994 and 1988
- the 28th Report (2011) included a chapter using data from the 2010 environment module, and the 27th Report (2010) included 2 chapters using the 2009 social inequality module

Whilst the main purpose of this application is for funds to provide a resource for the academic community, it is anticipated that the published findings that result will be of considerable interest to the wider community including government policy makers and other practitioners. Several elements of our proposed dissemination strategy will help ISSP findings to reach a wider audience, not least our commitment to ensuring that the annual British Social Attitudes Report, which receives extensive media coverage, contains a chapter using ISSP data.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>159848</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/L002795/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
