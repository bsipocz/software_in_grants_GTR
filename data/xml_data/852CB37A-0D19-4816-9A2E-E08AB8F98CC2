In response to these challenges, companies have restructured their workforce, diversifying wages and working conditions along the value chain and making increasing use of external work arrangements in order to compress costs and to acquire specialised knowledge. So far these strategies have had mixed outcomes for the organisations and for the workforce, leading to efficiency gains but also to human capital losses and to the deterioration of pay and working conditions. 

As the automotive industry has traditionally been a driver of the European economy and a provider of &amp;quot;good jobs&amp;quot;, its future has become a major concern to national governments and European institutions, which have prioritised sustainable economic growth and employment creation since the recent crisis. Therefore, this project provides a timely contribution to current debates as it investigates the conditions under which companies' human resource strategies to utilise and develop human capital can achieve positive organisational outcomes and sustainable employment outcomes. In particular, it will examine the influence of training and industrial relations institutions on how automotive companies match human capital with human resource systems (including pay, training, job design, contract status and career prospects), with varied outcomes for the organisation and the employees. 

Findings will be based on around 120 interviews with human resource managers and workers' representatives in six automotive plants in Germany, Italy and UK. The countries have been chosen because they differ in their institutions of industrial relations and vocational training. The research design takes into account different business units along the production chain such as direct production units, quality check and Research and Development in order to cover different typologies of human capital; furthermore, it does not only include workers directly employed by the core company but also those on onsite external work arrangements (e.g. subcontractors, agency staff). Thus, this project will collect unique in-depth comparative data in the automotive sector, with the aim to identify the combinations of human capital and institutional factors leading to different human resource systems and organisational outcomes. Data will be analysed using comparative case study design and the method of Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA).

This research will contribute to academic debates on how companies respond to similar production and knowledge requirements in different institutional contexts, with varied outcomes for the workforce and the organisation. Findings will have implications for managers and policy makers because they identify the institutional and human capital factors associated with effective human resource systems; in addition, comparative evidence will provide unions and practitioners in the field of labour market and social policy with valuable information about the institutions and regulations associated with better workers' outcomes in terms of wages, employment security and job design.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research will benefit three main stakeholder groups:

First, findings will be relevant to managers in the automotive industry and, more broadly, in the manufacturing industry, and to industry representatives. Companies have been restructuring their workforce making increasing use of external work arrangements and diversifying wages and working conditions along the value chain. These practices can have negative repercussions for the organisation due to e.g. knowledge losses, skill underutilisation and misalignments between local institutions and human resource systems, defined as bundles of human resource practices including job design, contractual status, pay, career prospects. This study will provide managers with invaluable information on how to effectively match human resource systems with employees' human capital and with the institutional environment. Findings will benefit, first of all, the organisations participating in the study, as the PI will collaborate strictly with the human resource departments. Furthermore, the findings will be disseminated more broadly to sectoral representative bodies at the national level and at the European level. 
 
Second, the proposed research will benefit unions and other workers' representative bodies in the case study companies, and in the metal sector in three study countries (Germany, Italy and United Kingdom), and in other European countries. They will benefit of the findings because they will provide a comparative overview of work arrangements for similar jobs in different countries. By looking at positive examples in other countries or companies, unions might learn new strategies and bargaining policies aimed at improving standards of wages and working conditions. Furthermore, findings will show under what conditions sustainable workers' outcomes are compatible with, and even contribute to, effective human resource systems in terms of productivity and innovation. If evidence showed that collective voice mechanisms and sustainable working arrangements for employees are beneficial to the organisation, this would make a strong case for union involvement at company level. 

Third, this project is relevant to policy-makers in the field of labour market, training and industrial policy in the three study countries, in other European countries and at the European level. Among others, findings will be of interest to policy actors such as the UK Commission for Employment and Skills, the German Alliance for Industry and the DG &amp;quot;Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion&amp;quot; of the European Commission. Especially since the recent economic crisis, national governments and European institutions have been concerned with the future of manufacturing in Europe, and particularly of the automotive industry, and have advocated a revival of this sector in order to stimulate employment and economic growth. For instance, &amp;quot;reviving manufacturing success&amp;quot; has been defined one of the key issue for the UK Parliament in the official briefing for the members of Parliament in 2015. In this context, policy-makers have been looking for solutions aimed at improving companies' competitiveness and innovation potential while at the same time ensuring sustainable workers' outcomes. This research project will provide policy-makers with comparative data on institutional factors enabling companies to adopt effective HR systems associated with positive workers' outcomes; in this way, the project will identify the need for policy intervention in terms of e.g. regulation of external work arrangements or investment in training.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>154624</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N01605X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DC53A3F2-81B6-40C9-874D-291D23B3C79F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>46FB536B-9B51-49F1-B2DF-5A14789705F2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Resource Management</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4FE4E471-D6BD-451C-B7BE-F13520DD3883</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Organisational Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
