Country houses represent long-standing elite rural lifestyles while water-powered textile mills refer to Britain's past as an industrial pioneer. However these sites suffer from a lack of diversity in the histories presented and the visitors they attract. Black and Asian groups are more typically resident in urban areas and report feelings of isolation and difference during visits to the countryside. Many feel their heritage is not sufficiently represented in rural sites, despite evidence existing of key connections. In country houses portraits of Black or Asian figures, 'exotic' products and plants suggest these connections, while textile mills display raw cotton supplies grown in warmer climates. Yet these histories are rarely explored or explained and are often seen as challenging to address due to associations with colonial and slave trade practices. 

This project seeks to connect together heritage organisations, Black and Asian community groups and academics in a collaboration which aims to benefit all parties. Drawing on evidence of historical connections with people of African and Asian descent its goals are to produce more diverse representations of Black and Asian histories in rural heritage sites and to change their organisational cultures. Two key examples of rural textile and country estate heritage sites have been selected as venues for the collaboration. The first is Cromford Mills is a key location in the Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage Site in Derbyshire, designated due to its pioneering cotton textile industry. The second is Newstead Abbey is a well-known country estate particularly due to its associations with the poet Bryon. In both cases the collaborating groups have committed to a series of discussions, visits and co-production of new ways of presenting these sites and enhancing their meaning and appeal for ethnic minority groups and wider society.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project seeks to create benefits for a range of non-academic and academic groups who operate at scales from the local to the international. A core group is Black and Asian Minority Ethnic groups (from Britain or international visitors) whose ancestors have links to the British cotton industry and/or country estates and whose histories are typically neglected in such heritage sites. Visitors from these groups will benefit through seeing their histories more deeply considered and the enhanced sense of value and belonging that this engenders.This could encourage more BAME people (adult and children) to visit or work in heritage sites. The actively participating local BAME groups (SHSH and NSTL) will benefit from further engagement with academic, public and third sector bodies, further reflection on their connections with country estate and/or cotton heritage sites, the development of new skills in creative displays of these connections, enhanced senses of collective esteem, belonging and achievement, strengthening of community and cross-cultural interactions. 
The managers of the heritage sites, their staff and volunteer guides are also key potential beneficiaries as they play a central role in presenting the sites to public visitors, including school groups. Very few of this group are currently from BAME backgrounds. They will benefit from increased interaction with BAME groups, their histories and perspectives with the aim of creating institutional change in terms of ethnic diversity. These interactions will increase the range of histories and perspectives presented and enhance the ability to communicate on challenging topics such as enslavement and colonialism. 
Visitors (British and international) to the heritage sites will also benefit from exposure to enriched and more internationally connected histories. School children, students and their teachers will benefit from more diverse educational resources and learning experiences at the sites. This may also impact on teaching within schools, colleges and universities. 
International experts in the heritage field, including the invited guests, as well as audiences of professional journals and World Heritage Site networks will benefit from the sharing of the project outputs in person, through webpages or through presentations. The international guests will also be able to share their own experiences and enrich further the perspectives of British BAME groups and heritage managers. The sharing of these experiences may also have impacts on heritage management and HEI teaching in international as well as national contexts. Teaching at the host HEI will be further enhanced by use of the project's heritage outcomes in student modules. These will also be shared via professional discipline networks in Geography and History at institutional, national and international levels though relevant presentations and publications.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>73099</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/P009689/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DCE73056-5E3D-4976-B573-234E5FF4D633</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic &amp; Social History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FC4405D9-8A0D-41F9-B71A-A19C9CD0AEFA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ethnicity</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AD75E543-5F70-43C2-A40D-4452373465C4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Heritage Management</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1D32A760-9B88-43D4-8BDA-F0236A67470A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography (General)</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
