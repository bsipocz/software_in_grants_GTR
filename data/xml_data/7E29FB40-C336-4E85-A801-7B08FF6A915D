Its stands for a whole collection of ideas, algorithms, computational models and knowledge systems. Recent success of particular types of machine learning (e.g. deep neutral nets) have again excited the interest of the scientific community in delivering insight into the complexity of the real world. This type of approach compliments the knowledge engineering systems that have previously been used, however they require massive amounts of data to be trained. Taking the chemical and materials sciences as exemplar areas we can see that the traditional approaches to scientific discovery work with relatively small amounts of often uncertain data which is distilled by human insight to yield predictions and testable theories which may evolve as new data becomes available. In these areas of science more data is becoming available and the impact of 'larger data' parallels the reality that almost all science now depends on computational assistance. Never-the-less the quantity of quality data needed to train the new AI systems is simply not directly available even with recent advances in automation. As a basis for the network we propose to use 'amplification by simulation' as a key element of the cycle of automated experiments, simulation, AI learning, prediction, comparison, design, further experiments, to create the environment in which leading AI developments can be applied to the chemical and materials discovery.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The network partners for the proposed Network+ provide an extensive reach to the academic and industrial communities in the UK interested in research in computing and the physical and life science providing access to the relevant people to create impact throughout the whole community. The cutting edge areas of chemical and material science to be support with cutting edge AI, mean that successful research projects will be of immediate importance to industry giving rise directly to new pharmaceuticals, antimicrobials, green production techniques, functional materials and more importantly they will yield new techniques to generate future critically needed chemicals and materials.

The membership of the network will mean that relevant researchers and industrialists will get to hear about the work though the network and be able to support applications of the work. Through the network connections we will have access to all the major players in the chemical and materials areas and the nature of the proposed network is such that we will also be able to bring on board the SMEs, providing opportunities for them to interact with academic groups and other commercial entities. The network will also engage with the media and governmental (regulatory) agencies as the potential role of AI in driving UK productivity and innovation is a current and significant public agenda.

Open Science, quality software, supported by the network will lead we believe to greater open innovation in this space. Combining the best of open source software with open source hardware and wetware. We see this as a very effective underpinning of wider public engagement, for example in supporting presentations and discussions at Schools and public events, to be able to demonstrate to the public what AI approaches offer to science and through these activities to the public.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1014318</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/S000356/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
