Aster Yellows phytoplasma strain Witches? Broom (AY-WB) induces symptoms that indicate developmental processes are perturbed in infected plants, including the growth of leaf-like flowers (phyllody) and the proliferation of stems (witches? broom phenotype). We hypothesize that AY-WB secretes effector proteins that alter plant development and down-regulate host defense mechanisms. The objectives of this proposal are: i) determine how the effector genes are regulated; and ii) functionally characterize a subset of putative effectors to determine whether these proteins modulate plant development. To realize these objectives, we propose the following experimental approaches. We will map promoters associated with genes encoding candidate effectors that are highly expressed in an insect or a plant host. Promoter sequences and upstream regions will be examined to identify regulatory elements that are associated with a host-specific expression, providing insight into the regulation of phytoplasma gene expression, and allowing the development of in silico promoter prediction methodologies. Furthermore, we will select a subset of AY-WB candidate effectors for functional characterization. The effector genes will be expressed in Arabidopsis, and the phenotype of the transgenic plants will be assessed to identify alterations in development. As phytoplasmas are restricted to the phloem of infected hosts, we will employ immunocytology to localize the effector proteins in infected plant tissues to assess whether the secreted phytoplasma proteins unload from the phloem and whether AY-WB encodes (additional) proteins that facilitate effector unloading into distal tissues. Finally, we will screen the putative effectors to probe for protein-protein interactions against an Arabidopsis cDNA library as a means of identifying (plant) host proteins that are targeted by the bacterial effectors.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-05-22</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-05-23</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_PROJECTED</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>71122</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Generated a video explaining how plants become zombies and posted this on YouTube.

Unlike many phytopathogens which must penetrate plant cell walls to gain access to the cytoplasm, phytoplasmas are injected directly into the cytoplasm of phloem sieve cells of a plant via the feeding activity of an insect vector.

In addition to symptoms of general decline and plant death, phytoplasmas such as AY-WB induce a range of symptoms that are reflective of an abnormal development of plant tissues, including the formation of witches' broom (a dense mass of shoots originating from a single point), phyllody (retrograde metamorphosis of floral organs into leaves), virescence (green pigmentation of tissues such as flowers) and bolting (growth of elongated stalks). These observations are consistent with a hypothesis that phytoplasmas modulate the growth and development of plants, possibly to enhance the attractiveness of the plant towards egg-laying insects; these alterations in morphology may create protective niches and prolong a vegetative growth phase that is more favourable for egg laying.

Once infected by phytoplasmas, plants cannot be cured. Control strategies primarily entail the sustained application of environmentally harmful pesticides as a means of reducing the vector populations. Economically, phytoplasmas cause significant problems in global crop production, and are responsible for such devastating diseases as the coconut lethal yellowing diseases (CLYD) of Africa and the Caribbean that lead to the impoverishment of local farmers. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, CLYD has resulted in the loss of coconut plantations in Tanzania, and has impoverished rural communities in Ghana that depend upon coconuts as a primary food source. The productivity of European crops has also been adversely affected by phytoplasmas, with grape vineyards and apple orchards suffering significant economic losses. Despite the economic importance of these organisms, little is known about how phytoplasmas regulate interaction with respective hosts. This project has helped to increase current knowledge of phytoplasma regulatory mechanisms.

This project has impacted society at several levels: (A) Interactions among science disciplines; (B) Training of young scientists; (C) Communication of science to (inter)national science communities; and (D) Engagement with the general public.

(A) Interactions among science disciplines

This research is interdisciplinary, as it unified the study of organisms spanning three Kingdoms (namely Prokaryota, Animalia, and Plantae) and thus incorporated microbiology, entomology, and plant biology. This project also adopted a multidisciplinary approach, with a primary focus upon molecular biology and expression profiling, coupled with bioinformatics, biochemistry, bioassays, and microscopy. Phytoplasma effectors are unique in that they interfere with fundamental developmental pathways of a plant, whereas classical effectors secreted by other phytopathogens typically target plant defence pathways. In addition, our work with SAP11 and SAP54 demonstrated that these effectors interfere with plant defences against insects, thus phytoplasma virulence proteins also affect a third organism in the interaction, the insect vector.

Expression analyses of about 50 phytoplasma candidate effector genes during phytoplasma infections of plant hosts and insect vectors showed that about a third are upregulated in the insect vector and two third in the plant hosts. Thus, the effectors are differentially regulated reflecting their activities in the insect vectors or plant hosts. 

We previous found that SAP11 induces leaf crinkling and stem proliferation in A. thaliana (BBS_E_J_000CA317), SAP54 induces the formation of leaf-like flowers and SAP05 the formation of aerial rosettes in these plants (BB/G001928/1). In this project we further described the leaf-like flower phenotypes of SAP54 transgenic plants. We also identified two additional phytoplasma effectors that induce severe stunting in these plants. 

We also found that four phytoplasma effectors change plant susceptibility to insect vectors. SAP54 promotes insect vector attraction and egg laying on A. thaliana plants, whereas two other phytoplasma effectors reduce A. thaliana non-host resistance to the maize-specialist leafhopper Dalbulus maidis; these insects survive longer and lay eggs on A. thaliana plants. Finally, one effector reduces leafhopper survival and reproduction. 

We further investigated how SAP54 interferes with flower development in plants. This work demonstrated that SAP54 interacts with MADS-box transcription factors (MTFs), which perform key roles in a variety of plant developmental processes, including the regulation of the transition from the vegetative to reproductive phase and the formation of flower structures. SAP54 degrades MTFs. SAP54 does this by interacting with members of the RAD23 family, which shuttle SAP54-MTF complexes to the plant 'garbage bin'. In the absence of the RAD23 members, plants produce normal flowers when infected with phytoplasmas. RAD23 (and the degradation of MTFs by SAP54) is also required for the attraction of leafhoppers to phytoplasma-infected plants.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We were the first to show the mechanisms by which virulence proteins (effectors) of microbial pathogens affect plant flower development and that this impacts plant resistance to insect pests. This connection between plant development and defense is important, because breeding efforts targeted to promote yields of crops may potentially be counter productive if they lead to decreased plant resistance to pathogens and pests. We (and others) will explore this further.

We are exploring knowledge generated in this project for engineering SAP54 to target the degradation of specific MTFs leading to desirable phenotypes in plants (funded by BBS/E/J/000C0623). When successful, this line of research will be licensed and becomes attractive for funding by industry.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>6BEE9FF4-D23D-47B1-B655-28A103812686</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54621127e83454.28462001</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Education,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.jic.ac.uk/staff/saskia-hogenhout/Phytoplasma/index.html</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3B5D9BED-D75F-41DF-AEF9-F2A844B7CBCF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Diverse targets of phytoplasma effectors: from plant development to defense against insects.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Annual review of phytopathology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e610428455c7e3d119e6967f3044dce9"><gtr:id>e610428455c7e3d119e6967f3044dce9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Sugio A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0066-4286</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>54465e19982092.91864232</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>89196E2E-5988-45A1-BF00-B6E7F2B7B2D9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Phloem - Molecular Cell Biology, Systemic Communication, Biotic Interactions</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/1889afabce7916f991463c5ea00f85ec"><gtr:id>1889afabce7916f991463c5ea00f85ec</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>MacLean A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780470958605</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>5446655f47f3c6.21502038</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E2AC24AB-9538-4C50-8A17-38AD0F667818</gtr:id><gtr:title>Phytoplasma effector SAP54 hijacks plant reproduction by degrading MADS-box proteins and promotes insect colonization in a RAD23-dependent manner.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>PLoS biology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/3145fab20d1256f266e0e88c046f83f6"><gtr:id>3145fab20d1256f266e0e88c046f83f6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>MacLean AM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1544-9173</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>54465e181c67c4.46446414</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A5FD49D4-8BC9-4012-AA78-EA1EF3BCB257</gtr:id><gtr:title>Phytoplasma effector SAP54 induces indeterminate leaf-like flower development in Arabidopsis plants.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Plant physiology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/3145fab20d1256f266e0e88c046f83f6"><gtr:id>3145fab20d1256f266e0e88c046f83f6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>MacLean AM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0032-0889</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>54465e1b21af48.95141913</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BBS/E/J/000CA452</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
