Numerous studies (using a range of methods and shaped by a variety of motivations) have set out to describe, understand, measure and evidence what it is that people value about museum and gallery visiting, what benefits accrue from engagement and participation and what longer term impacts result from this engagement for individuals and society more broadly. However, there has been no systematic attempt to draw together and critically assess this body of research in order to build a clear understanding of what these diverse studies and approaches tell us, what gaps exist and what future research directions are needed. The proposed review addresses these long overdue questions to provide insights of value to policymakers, funders and practitioners.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Funders and Policy makers

The proposed research will significantly enhance understanding around a suite of questions that continue to challenge policy makers in the fields of culture and education. The project will summarise the evidence base substantiating claims about cultural value that will, in turn, help to generate a degree of consensus around the benefits that museums and galleries offer to the public and to society more broadly. 

Researchers

The project will help to establish a coherent research agenda for future studies, directing research attention towards identified gaps in knowledge and understanding and highlighting methodological approaches that are likely to yield significant new insights in the future.

Museums and galleries

Museums and galleries are under greater pressure than ever before to demonstrate their social and cultural value. When the Museums Association launched Museums Change Lives in 2013 (offering a vision for the social impact of museums and galleries) it prompted considerable debate about the extent to which the claims it makes about the value of visiting could be substantiated. This study will provide a compelling and clear picture about what is known and rigorously evidenced and what remains to be explored.

Wider public

Major studies in this field have already benefited the wider public by providing museum practitioners with knowledge that can help to shape better museum experiences. For example, major investigations into the learning outcomes that result from museum engagement are being used by practitioners to shape more engaging and impactful experiences. The proposed study will support practitioners in their on-going efforts to improve the experiences they offer to visitors.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>24121</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The Cultural Value of Engaging with Museums and Galleries</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3F9B9E9E-02A6-489F-9E61-CC53518DB47C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>At a time when museums and galleries are under pressure to demonstrate their cultural and social value, how value is measured, captured and communicated is critical. What do we already know about the value of visiting, participating in, and engaging with museums and galleries for individuals and society more broadly? How can we improve our understanding of user experiences of museums and galleries? 
In conversation with Carol Scott, researcher and museum consultant, and John Orna-Ornstein, Director of Museums, Arts Council England, this event explored the findings of RCMG's research on the cultural value of museums and galleries. What does the existing evidence tell us and what are the implications for museums now, and in the future? Bringing together over 70 museum professionals, Masters and PhD students, researchers, and policymakers this session inspired debate and sparked exchanges from a range of perspectives, which got to the essence of the need to be able to articulate the cultural value of museums and galleries. Its inter-disciplinary exchanges raised new ways of thinking that got to grips which addressing a thorny issue from both a practical and theoretical perspective.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b83bbccbfb89.29547724</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/museumstudies/rcmg/projects/the-cultural-value-of-engaging-with-museums-and-galleries-1</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>A report of the research findings, User value of museums and galleries: a critical review of the literature, is available online via RCMG's website (http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/museumstudies/rcmg/publications/cultural-value-of-museums) and is also be made available through the Leicester Research Archive.

As part of a series of annual RCMG events, an event on Wednesday 25 February 2015 used the research findings as the basis for debate and discussion between researchers, museum leaders, funders and policy makers.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>BC44D3A8-28D2-4C97-BDB5-4F4E37CDC90C</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54635ce159fce4.64874686</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The research conducted a critical review of the existing body of research evidence in the UK about the value of visiting museums and galleries for audiences.

The report of the research findings, User value of museums and galleries: a critical review of the literature, is available online via the Research Centre for Museums and Galleries (RCMG) website.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings formed the basis for the RCMG annual event in 2015 which was aimed at practitioners, policy makers and funders. Similar to previous events, it took the form of a debate around the central theme of cultural value, featuring speakers Carol Scott and John Orna-Ornstein of Arts Council England, and attracted around 100 participants.

We have targeted dissemination to key stakeholders engaged in developing policy around cultural value for example the Museums Association and International Council of Museums, and Arts Council England. The findings have been widely disseminated at conferences including to the American Alliance of Museums in Atlanta, Georgia, US, 2015 and the GEM (Group for Education in Museums) in Cardiff, UK, 2015.

The findings form the basis for an ACE-funded project, specifically their Research strand, which is currently in development, entitled 'Do Museums Create Public Value?'</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D83A2B40-14A2-4157-B9CA-20E643311B34</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54635bbbb96a47.69564137</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/museumstudies/rcmg/publications/cultural-value-of-museums</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Reached a range of practitioners and policymakers through features in Museums Journal, through professional training events and international conference</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9957E0BA-F9BE-4129-86E0-DAAB7F2708FA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>It gives practitioners a greater depth of understanding of the impact of their work. The report and its findings articulated the value cultural of museums, by sharing this with a range of practitioners and policymakers through features in Museums Journal, through professional training events and international conference, it enabled people to articulate the value of their practice. Which gave them the impetus to be more confident about its social value and driving practice forward to address societal issues. This is especially significant in a post-Brexit context.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c03d4c495176.71794063</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AEB3CFB9-E0DB-4038-B137-CE6D70859850</gtr:id><gtr:title>Cultural Value: User value of museums and galleries: a critical review of literature</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/58111246d2f0f0230125191a98ab674a"><gtr:id>58111246d2f0f0230125191a98ab674a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Scott C.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58b839bbbc1de0.06575410</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/L014394/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8C451D81-4626-46D5-BE5B-7B684CED97EF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural Studies &amp; Pop Culture</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AD75E543-5F70-43C2-A40D-4452373465C4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Heritage Management</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>51073B72-B972-4034-A0A1-87A6B0DCD198</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Museum &amp; Gallery Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>76FB1E61-2A96-432A-BFFC-56D6B977DF1E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Policy, Arts Mgmt &amp; Creat Ind</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
