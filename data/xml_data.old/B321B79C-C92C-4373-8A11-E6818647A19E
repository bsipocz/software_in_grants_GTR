There are also an unprecedented number of new editions of modernist texts being published, as modernist authors' works emerge from copyright. It is, therefore, now urgently necessary to enable key figures working from a diverse range of theoretical and methodological perspectives in modernist editing to come together in person to share their experience and expertise, enhance their own practice, and disseminate this to a wider audience (for details see attached Case for Support).

We have identified the New Modernist Editing (or NME) as a concept to describe the important recent developments in scholarly and editorial practice in the preparation and production of modernist texts. These developments include:
 - Scholarly awareness of the particular set of challenges and opportunities presented by the editing of modernist texts, such as preserving the spirit of fluidity and uncertainty which permeates modernist aesthetics, and taking account of the self-conscious process of revision undertaken by many modernist writers;
 - Recent developments in the modernist literary critical field making necessary a thoroughgoing appraisal of the responsibilities of the editor of the modernist text, most notably the inauguration of the New Modernist Studies by the establishment of the Modernist Studies Association in 1999;
 - Recent developments in textual editing more generally, including the focus on material contexts of a text's publication, but also and most notably genetic criticism which examines draft versions of the text without focussing on a 'final' text;
 - Online editions: the development of new digital technologies enabling scholars to present their textual expertise and research in ways not possible through the traditional book format.

Hitherto, there have been only very limited opportunities for scholars working on the various different modernist editions underway to come together to discuss their work in this field, and none that has also included other key stakeholders such as publishers, archivists, theorists of textual editing and other makers of editions of modernist texts (such as book artists). Our project seeks to enable this exchange, establish the NME as a coherent, original and productive interdisciplinary approach to textual editing, and communicate this project to a wide audience within and beyond the academy.

This Network will explore opportunities and challenges to modernist scholarship, textual editing and publication practices offered by the NME. The Network will cross disciplinary boundaries by including scholars in the fields of modernist literature, comparative literature, textual scholarship and the digital humanities, as well as reaching beyond the academy by including representatives of traditional publishing houses, independent digital publishers, archivists, and book artists. Network participants have also been carefully selected so that a range of career stages, from postdoctoral to Professor, are represented, and to include representatives of all the major new modernist editions currently underway in the UK, as well as international participants involved in further projects. The Network will speak to the AHRC theme of Digital Transformations in the Arts and Humanities by integrating, as fundamental to its aims, consideration of the opportunities offered to editors of modernist texts by developments in digital technology. It will offer a series of three events organised around three key questions:
1. What is the New Modernist Editing?
2. What are its current and potential audiences?
3. How does the NME respond to the new conditions of cultural production?
All the major modernist editions currently underway in the UK will be represented - an unprecedented coming together of key editors in the field.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The New Modernist Editing Network will enhance understanding among cognate professionals and practitioners and among the public more widely of a) issues in contemporary textual editing, and b) the cultural and aesthetic contexts of modernist texts. It will achieve this impact in various ways:

Who?
Publishers. This impact will be achieved by having several publishing professionals as Network members and attending all three Network events: Brad Scott, an independent publisher with particular expertise in digital publications; Linda Bree, Commissioning Editor in the Humanities team at Cambridge University Press; and Jackie Jones, Editorial Director at Edinburgh University Press. Knowledge exchange between Network participants is of course fundamental to its activities, both within and between sectors and disciplines. This project will therefore generate impact on publishing houses through dissemination by these participants of the good practice and innovations developed as part of the Network's knowledge exchange activities.

Artists. This impact will be achieved by having the book artists Jane Hyslop and Nancy Campbell as Network members. Campbell and Hyslop are prominent among UK book artists with a track record of success in collaborative projects. They will be key figures in disseminating within the artistic community the Network's findings on the creative potential offered by synergies between the makers of artists' books and scholars of textual editing.

Archivists and Librarians. Fiona Courage, archivist at The Keep, is a key Network participant, and her involvement will facilitate dissemination of the Network's activities to archivists and librarians holding modernist manuscripts, enhancing future collaboration between archivists, scholars and artists in the preparation of new editions of modernist texts.

How?
Website. While initially facilitating communication between Network members, the website will eventually become an archive of the Network's activities, publicly available, becoming a means of disseminating the issues arising from the process of textual editing modernism in all its stages.

Digital edition. A key output of the Network is a digital edition of Virginia Woolf's 'Ode Written Partly in Prose on Seeing the Name of Cutbush Above a Butcher's Shop in Pentonville', a short modernist text. This digital edition will be hosted on the website of The Keep, which houses among its extensive collections the Monks House Papers (the second most important Virginia Woolf archive in the world), and will have an accompanying practice guide, outlining the processes involved in textual editing and the decisions made by scholars and publishers as the text is prepared. The Keep is a public-facing archive with a strong track record of public engagement; hosting the digital edition on their website will maximise the impact of the Network's activities on the general public. The site on The Keep will also include a prominent link to the more detailed Network website. In addition, the archivists at The Keep will benefit from the raised profile of the archive's literary special collections.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>34629</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Website</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F16494A9-B826-4A88-BDCD-5BC024D0D65D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We established a website for the New Modernist Editing soon after the award began. This website has areas specifically for Network participants, and also provides participants with a repository of information about the Network so I have chosen 'study participants/study members' above as the primary audience, although in fact the Network participants are largely themselves academics so this may not be what is intended by that option. It is hard to gauge what other audiences may have accessed the website but it certainly includes both postgraduate and undergraduate students, and very likely also professional practitioners, industry/business and third sector organisations because of the Network's contacts in those fields. As at 13th March 2017 the site had had 507 individual visitors and 1,838 views in total.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6b0b5e87cf5.10301821</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://newmodernistediting.wordpress.com/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016,2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Twitter feed</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1D8CEAC9-4D13-429F-BF17-781A1C82ABD9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We established a Twitter account for the New Modernist Editing Network soon after it was set up; we tweet about our activities and related matters of interest in modernism and in editing. We currently have 157 followers; a significant proportion are fellow academics but many fall into other categories of audience as detailed above. Others have also tweeted about our work using the hashtag #NewModEditing.

Outcomes are hard to gauge as such but the level of likes and retweets suggests that many (dozens?) of our followers have actively engaged with our work as a result of seeing our tweets. Twitter has been particularly useful in disseminating information about our PGR training event and encouraging PGRs to apply - which is why I have chosen 'plans made for future related activity' as the most likely and concrete outcome/impact so far.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6aee10f8a66.30162920</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://twitter.com/NewModEditing</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016,2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1C44C637-D582-4D81-A941-905857E5864E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Item of Special Interest</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Society for Textual Scholarship Newsletter</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/72bb116933a3a8179015cf494e0735d7"><gtr:id>72bb116933a3a8179015cf494e0735d7</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Randall, B</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c7bf28603714.53030734</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/N00759X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>B94A2498-60DA-4055-A957-686B6CB42654</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Linguistics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FB301405-099D-44B9-ADA9-75B11FDED8C0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>English Language &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9DFBE9F1-538E-4C96-B606-5163472E6960</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Literary &amp; Cultural Theory</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F36E60AB-C819-4E85-9AFD-A4428F6534AF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Textual Editing &amp; Bibliography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
