Invitations were issued on the basis of the volume and profile of funding received from EPSRC.The Department is internationally leading with very strong research across Pure and Applied Mathematics. A Platform Grant will provide a baseline of funding to retain key staff between projects, to develop new collaborations, and to undertake feasibility studies and preliminary research work into new research directions. It will enhance the health and capability of the research base in the Department and allow us to improve our position in relation to EPSRC's strategic research agenda. In particular, it will enhance the Department's ability to contribute to new and emerging research challenges and to identify the mathematical areas in which we can have effective impact as contributors to transformative and cross-disciplinary research.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Given the underpinning nature of Platform Grant support, the potential beneficiaries of WAMP include all those who might benefit from any mathematical research, or from any collaboration involving mathematicians, or from any research in the sciences or social sciences with significant mathematical input. This therefore covers academics in a wide range of disciplines, significant parts of the public sector, business and industry, and the public and society in general. A main aim of the proposed grant is to assist in positioning the Department in relation to EPSRC's strategic research agenda. It is therefore intended, in a very direct sense, that WAMP should have impact on and bring benefit to both the Department and EPSRC. WAMP activity, by improving the fit between academic mathematics departments and EPSRC's strategic priorities, should thereby enhance the impact and benefits accruing from EPSRC funding activity in mathematics and more generally. The form of potential benefits from mathematical research, particularly if well-aligned with EPSRC priorities, is as broad as the pool of potential beneficiaries. In addition, there will be more direct and immediate benefit from greater public understanding of the role of mathematics through the proposed series of public lectures.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>520808</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>PIRE Workshop: Atomistic and Multi-Scale Models of Materials</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>089021A0-9750-4C47-A256-6136BA087E56</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The topic of the workshop is the interplay between microscopic material models and the corresponding macroscopic continuum theories.

The impact of big data on learning deep neural models for speech, image and language understanding 

In our quest to build deep neural models to reproduce different brain functions, we have discovered that it is of paramount importance to understand how data shapes the brain. Models that are learned from data are the best at many tasks such as speech recognition, language modelling and image understanding --- e.g., detecting where faces occur in photos and recognizing road features for self-driving cars. In this talk, I will describe how neuroscience, statistics and computer science have influenced the design of deep neural models, which have won many recent prediction competitions and have become state-of-the-art in image recognition tasks and speech recognition. I will argue that at present the complexity of our models is so large that big data is essential to learn these models appropriately.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dda0ddf18d47.08286351</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/research/events/publiclectures/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop on Free Divisors</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B28AD980-973A-4095-AD80-73E0168112ED</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Workshop on Free Divisors</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dd9a7e153644.99615743</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/research/events/2010-2011/freediv/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2010</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Explicit Methods in Number Theory: Conference in Honour of John Cremona's 60th Birthday</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>354CEC5C-E174-4EF5-BF9C-79D12DC3FBBF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Explicit Methods in Number Theory:

The aim of the workshop is to provide a forum to discuss recent statistical modelling strategies to solve complex problems, with a focus on biomedicine, Bayesian methods and high-dimensional inference. Some specifics topics of interest are:

?Prior choice: objective approaches, model separation and the value of informative priors

?High-dimensional model selection, including graphical models and correlated data

Professor Lenstra will look at Escher's 1956 work The Print Gallery, which depicts a swirling impossible world centred around a mysterious hole in the middle of the image.

The lecture will offer a fascinating insight into how art and maths work together. People often think of mathematics as something extremely specialised and abstract which is just not relevant to their daily lives. But the opposite is in fact true - mathematics runs through so much, whether it's the banking system or the music we listen to. It's not often you see mathematics and art together on the same bill but Escher's works are a great illustration of how the two are interlinked.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dda17c63dba0.36198208</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/research/events/publiclectures/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>BrAG (British Algebraic Geometry)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0C1CB073-BF2D-4912-AA06-B19507C3293C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>BrAG will become a series of regular meetings of British algebraic geometers.

Epidemics have long been a source of fear and fascination in human societies, but it is only in comparatively recent times that their origins and patterns have begun to yield their secrets through mathematical and scientific study.

The talk will examine the role played by predictive modelling in modern infectious disease epidemiology and will illustrate this by reference to past epidemics including the very recent H1N1 influenza pandemic (Did we overreact ? How can we better measure and predict pathogenicity? Will the H1N1 experience have a detrimental impact on how we respond to future epidemics?). The talk will also examine some of the neglected tropical diseases to address how can epidemiological modelling help the poorest societies in the world control infection and disease, and also help international agencies develop cost effective policies?</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dda129cac055.01907345</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/research/events/publiclectures/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Multiscale Inverse Problems</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CE619647-A04E-48E2-B4E5-64236F1FBD9C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The scientific focus of this workshop will be subsurface inverse problems, from the applied, computational and theoretical standpoints.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dd9b929077e9.90570488</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/research/events/2012-2013/nonsymp/mip/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>May 2013 School and Conference on Control and Games</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E31A5297-7E37-4243-BBC7-687B5743AED8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This school and conference is the fourth in a series of Warwick Spring events on control and games.

The meeting will bring together leading researchers, establishing the current state of research at the interface of dynamical systems, complex systems, and real-world applications. Current research results and future directions will be disseminated to a wide audience including PhD students and early-career researchers. We expect to welcome participants with a broad scientific background from the UK, Europe, and internationally, in particular from the complex systems and nonlinear dynamics communities and from those developing applications of mathematics to ecology, epidemiology, systems biology, statistical physics, mechanics and finance.

The meeting has been badged to celebrate the sixtieth birthday of Professor Robert MacKay FRS, who has been a world-leading researcher in nonlinear dynamical systems and complexity science, most recently also interested in applying mathematics to the study of social systems. There will be a conference dinner in Robert's honour, with speeches focussing on his outstanding contribution to mathematics and science over the last 40 years and his influence on the careers of his many students, postdocs and collaborators, but the meeting itself will focus on current and future developments in this growing field, a field in which Robert himself continues to make major contributions.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dd9f7c7c4d18.23297828</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/research/events/2015-16/nonsymposium/dcs/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>WPLMS: Professor C?dric Villani (University of Lyon)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>72F01F97-3E8C-44A5-AB3D-08C4A5DED1E6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The scientific career of John Nash started with his celebrated contributions to &amp;quot;game theory&amp;quot;, the subject of his doctoral thesis which he defended in 1950 at the age of 22. It is for this first contribution that he was awarded the economics Nobel prize in 1994!

After his PhD, John Nash turned to a very different area of mathematics. Between 1954 and 1958 he published three articles in which he proved three theorems that revolutionised mathematical analysis. For mathematicians, it is really for these three articles, more than for his work on game theory, that Nash deserves his place in the pantheon of mathematics. This talk will focus on one of these theorems by explaining its scope in simple terms and by insisting on the notion of regularity, central in Nash's work and in modern analysis in general.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dda0971b72b9.11007299</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/research/events/publiclectures/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Advances in Geometric Analysis</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>41081CF1-0B80-47F1-A348-827C45882C8B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Advances in Geometric Analysis

The purpose of the workshop is to bring Macaulay2 developers together with those who would like to share or develop their skills at writing packages for Macaulay2 and those interested in developing the corresponding mathematical algorithms. We are interested in participants with a broad range of experience with Macaulay2, from very experienced to novices. The novices will have the opportunity to learn about Macaulay2 from the more experienced participants.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c675e192b251.90330905</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://sites.google.com/site/macaulay2workshop2016/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>72F99577-C0C4-4FA0-BD94-A840260B4F69</gtr:id><gtr:title>Non-existence of local solutions for semilinear heat equations of Osgood type</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Differential Equations</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4bb2c05d8e02e47baddbf4f3ece74f48"><gtr:id>4bb2c05d8e02e47baddbf4f3ece74f48</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Laister R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cff9ff993b45b1</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>86C2B78C-DE3D-4774-ADA5-7A50E306C759</gtr:id><gtr:title>A complete characterisation of local existence for semilinear heat equations in Lebesgue spaces</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Annales de l'Institut Henri Poincare (C) Non Linear Analysis</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4bb2c05d8e02e47baddbf4f3ece74f48"><gtr:id>4bb2c05d8e02e47baddbf4f3ece74f48</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Laister R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>585d6108cc2308.68353540</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/I019138/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>80</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>9C124926-5968-486F-9B51-CCEB6C4E9650</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Particle physics - theory</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>99E0B904-CAB5-4511-AFB3-AA6D2B171F97</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Process engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>27F853CB-FB22-4B9D-82D7-542648D097F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Algebra &amp; Geometry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>02B9E893-AC2F-436D-BF88-28E1AC827F5D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Continuum Mechanics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>53CC8ACD-11A0-48ED-8743-F66E9A657C12</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Fluid Dynamics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9A30FDC6-AEB7-447C-A30E-0EF6BDB406FB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Logic &amp; Combinatorics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>04D8FF87-2CFC-44E7-A7DF-47E10C813E05</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical Analysis</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0F2F1A7-287A-4B6F-AA0E-74A55BB4DEE4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical Aspects of OR</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ABA2EC9F-6524-443A-BB92-7DF199FE4B25</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical Physics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>93E27C3B-6D00-4F18-BBE3-96C05C8F92B2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Non-linear Systems Mathematics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>CFBD6626-50CB-4AA6-8B49-9A76519BA91F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Numerical Analysis</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>62309876-5C71-411C-B1A7-1B2907AFB5A8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Statistics &amp; Appl.
