All known matter consists of fermions such as electrons and quarks while interactions - electromagnetism, weak and strong forces - between the matter is mediated by bosons such as photons and gluons. Physicists have developed a wonderful theory to describe the particle dynamics: quantum field theory [QFT]. Among the particles there are many symmetries and the latters search is one of the keys to understanding nature. One intriguing symmetry is supersymmetry which relates bosons to fermions and vice versa. It soon became clear that it may play a fundamental role in particle physics. Despite its success, QFT seems to be incompatible with gravity. As one wishes to unify all forces in nature, one seeks for alternative approaches. The reason why it is difficult to include gravity is that in QFT particles are point-like. With this in mind, people started studying theories that view particles as extended objects. This led to the birth of string theory. String theory in fact treats all particles as excitation modes of tiny strings. It also automatically contains a particle called graviton: the mediator of gravity. Its theoretical success made string theory the most promising canditate for a theory of everything. As such it must yield all results obtained from QFT. This issue became one of the most important subjects. A decade ago it was realised that a certain string theory is dual to a certain QFT: type IIB superstring theory on an Anti-de Sitter [AdS] space and N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills [SYM] theory. Most remarkably, this duality, known as AdS/CFT duality, relates a theory with gravity to one without. Whilst strong evidence for this duality has been found, its proof remains open. In addition, it was recently observed that SYM theory is dual to another string theory: twistor string theory. It is formulated on twistor space, a space that is extremely helpful for discussing properties of physical theories. Most interestingly, twistor strings make manifest the apparent simplicity of phenomenologically interesting quantities such as scattering amplitudes between particles in [S]YM theory - quantities that physicists measure at particle colliders. In short, the proposed research programme deals with the twistor space description of the theories just mentioned. I will explore certain gravity theories, called Einstein supergravities, and translate them to twistor space. The power of twistor theory is that everything is encoded in terms of geometric data on twistor space and thus, reduced to classical questions in geometry - questions which are easier to answer. I will study the twistor string formulation of supergravities. Like SYM theories, they also seem to admit a twistor string formulation. These considerations will shed light on quantum aspects of supergravities and in particular on the question of perturbative finiteness of maximally supersymmetric Einstein gravity. If a consistent twistor string exists, it provides a new approach to quantum gravity. I will also study classical and quantum N=4 SYM theory by means of twistors. I will investigate integrability properties that result from certain non-local symmetries. This part of the project will give insight into the origin of integrability, which is one of the pressing questions in the AdS/CFT duality. In of view that, I will also study integrability aspects of the AdS string. Since N=4 SYM theory is dual not only to this but also to the twistor string, one has to understand the connection between these two string theories. This issue and the question of integrability in twistor string theory will also be investigated. Summarising, the results obtained will contribute to our understanding of the relation between field and string theories, and they will also impact on perturbative issues [e.g. new methods for the computation of scattering amplitudes] in gauge and gravity theories.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>192537</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Please see key findings for details.</gtr:description><gtr:id>F5164767-5BF3-405A-A6A3-D389380BE2DD</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>5446345dde8f29.83010473</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>There was a slight change in the objectives of the research programme due to the emergence of questions that seemed even more intriguing to pursue. In general, however, in line with the questions posed in the original proposal, I have investigated integrability questions in gauge and string theories. A selection of results are outlined below: By means of the AdS/CFT duality, my collaborators and I discovered the origin of the so-called dual superconformal symmetry in N=4 SYM theory at strong coupling. Amongst other things, this symmetry is for instance responsible for various unexpected simplifications of particle scattering amplitudes. Our results were published in two articles which have already had a substantial impact on the community. Moreover, our results have led to many further investigations in SYM theory and in other theories. Furthermore, I gave an alternative view on the integrability of superstrings on AdS5 x S5 by means of twistor theory. This work opens up a new direction of investigation in which twistor methods can be used for the studies of hidden symmetry structures such as the dual superconformal symmetry. Moreover, one of the mysteries of the AdS/CFT duality is the problem of extracting dual background geometries directly from the gauge theory. My collaborator and I were able to find analytic solutions to the matrix model that describes certain states in N=4 SYM which in turn are dual to certain supergravity solutions. Prior to our work, only numerical solutions were known, and thus it forms a fruitful starting point for extracting geometry. Recently, my collaborator and I extended twistor methods to conformal theories in six dimensions in view of applications to the mysterious N=(0,2) theory. In particular, we gave a detailed analysis of free fields in six dimensions and found a novel twistor description of self-dual strings what clarifies their integrability. This work is an important step towards finding a twistorial description of theories relevant to M-theory. We are currently in the process of extending these ideas.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>See above under &amp;quot;what was discovered&amp;quot;.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>94E081AE-CF85-4006-B90F-C39B8BEC0EEA</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544633e23ac3d6.91395822</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/F008457/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C2898760-D7E5-4B25-A236-E7869CD74F88</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Particle physics - experiment</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>200B9B9B-68EC-4D70-B889-6BD5F4538080</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Beyond the Standard Model</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
