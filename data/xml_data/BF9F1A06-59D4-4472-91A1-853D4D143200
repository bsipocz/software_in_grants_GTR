Despite the absence of written historical records, pre-Columbian people of the Amazon Basin developed remarkable soils referred to as Amazonian 'dark earths' (ADEs), used to promote sustainable agriculture. With increasing global demand for food, energy and carbon, it is crucial to understand and learn from past land use systems in order to appropriately manage the current and plan the future land uses. The current project will contribute to the knowledge of how soil animals and their biodiversity are related with soil fertility, ADE formation and land use changes in a mega-diverse biome. Furthermore, it will strengthen the 'ADE Network', and provide capacity building to Brazilian researchers and students interested in Amazonian biodiversity and sustainable agriculture. The results will promote better understanding of how to sustainably use and manage Amazonian soils, while simultaneously preserving their rich biodiversity.

Therefore, the proposed project will establish a collaborative network composed by a multi-disciplinary, multi-institutional team of researchers in different areas of Brazil (and the world), therefore solidifying the connection between the UK and Brazil, in particular between Cardiff University and Embrapa Forestry.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed project will establish a collaborative network composed by a wide number of researchers from different scientific backgrounds and therefore solidifying the connection between the United Kingdom and Brazil, in particular the collaborative status of Cardiff University. The originality and innovative highlights to retain are the following: 

i) by conducting high quality interdisciplinary research on soil biodiversity and ecology of Amazon Dark Earths and by connecting it to past land use legacies will help determine to which extent it is possible to recreate some properties of such highly fertile soils in today's agricultural settings; 

ii) the research will enable the proposal of a new model for ADEs genesis; 

iii) it will establish a collaborative framework virtually connected by an online interface, making the resources available to the community and general public; 

iv) it will describe the soil biodiversity associated with human presence in the Amazon in areas that are currently unknown; 

v) at same time, it will transfer genomics and computational tools developed by the applicant to the partner hosting during the outgoing phase (using small group workshops and seminars), and finally 

vi) the genomic resources raised and expertise in applying environmental genomics into the context of a tropical rainforest has the potential to provide tools to assist projects globally that are attempting to understand soil ecology in tropic zones under threat from growing agricultural demands. 

In addition the potential of genomics as a tool to provide insight into ancient ecologies and agriculture approaches is now gathering significant scientific traction providing significant future opportunities. More directly, as the developed world is placing developing economies under increasing demands to deliver inexpensive food at the cost of some of the world's centres of biodiversity, the current project looks to the past to find more sustainable approaches to intensification for the future.

Three specific on-line strategies will be used to communicate with the public about the project each coordinated through a central web-site, a static 6th month e-newsletter, dynamic blog revealing the progression of the expeditions and events, such blog will be connected interactively with other social media outreach channels (such as Twitter, Facebook and Google+). The infrastructure to support this stratified outreach approach is already in use by Prof. Kille to support the Environmental 'Omics Synthesis Community and his personal research team and it will be customised appropriately to support this project. The project will exploit the Cardiff University external relations division to promote the project activities looking to engage directly with national and international media as the team has previously in other projects. When in Cardiff the Fellow will present at the annual Marie Curie evenings and contribute to the on-going science caf&amp;eacute; series which will both be aimed at direct public engagement.

It will be essential to support dissemination of the results to discrete sectors, the ADEs associated research community and eventually the wider scientific society. The former community will require dynamic interactive access, which will be achieved using CU's Confluence Wiki to create an Open Data Management Framework compliant with Horizon 2020. Cardiff University will also use its established relationship with Radio Wales to promote the research through its 'week in science' show.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-04-19</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>37718</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (EMBRAPA)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Brazil, Federative Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Embrapa Forests</gtr:department><gtr:description>TPInetwork</gtr:description><gtr:id>56292E78-1EF7-430B-88FB-AA6DD241BDAB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Outputs are list on tpinet.org website.

The program of the workshop included talks grouped in thematic sessions (in total 28 talks grouped in 10 sessions) and followed by chaired discussions. Some of the participants (15) also presented posters about their ongoing research; in the end of each day, these participants provided a short 'pitch talk', during which they introduced themselves and provided a short description of their poster, which remained exposed during the three days of the event.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c856993cdaa9.59461075</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.terrapretaprogram.org/fifth_workshop.aspx</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>SETAC/iEOS Joint Focused Topic Meeting, Ghent, Belgium</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4F89DDEF-38CA-4D54-9D30-FE76A2E9D91F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation on the Hookaworm project at an international academic conference</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c68099abebe4.02258814</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://epigenetics.setac.eu/home/?contentid=1068&amp;pr_id=1067</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>1st Symposium of Edaphic engineers, Terra Preta de Indio and Soil Fertility</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7D370D72-D81E-4CB6-B870-C6B12DCCF340</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Multidisciplinary workshop bring together and international community of academics interested in 'Terra Preta de Indio'.

Then, from November 11th to 13th, the organisation proposed a taxonomy workshop with practical training in earthworm taxonomy, ecology and sampling.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c8592ce94093.49471927</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://iotm2016.sciencesconf.org</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Fifth International Workshop of the Terra Preta Program - The 'Terra Preta de ?ndio' research network</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B37D6EF7-AB8D-47A7-9D7D-AF18AE236CB9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>From August 29th to 31st, 2016, in Piracicaba, Brazil, the 'Fifth International Workshop of the Terra Preta Program' took place. The final workshop of the program was attended by a diverse and interdisciplinary group of around 65 researchers working on anthropogenic soils/landscapes, biochar and related subjects, representing around 23 institutions from five countries (The Netherlands, Brazil, Colombia, Germany and South Africa). The program of the workshop included talks grouped in thematic sessions (in total 28 talks grouped in 10 sessions) and followed by chaired discussions. Some of the participants (15) also presented posters about their ongoing research; in the end of each day, these participants provided a short 'pitch talk', during which they introduced themselves and provided a short description of their poster, which remained exposed during the three days of the event.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c85715ce5595.72417011</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.terrapretaprogram.org/fifth_workshop.aspx</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>30986</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Integrating remote sensing and ground-based spectral analysis to investigate biodiversity of archaeological sites in Amazonia</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-12-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Science and Technologies Facilities Council (STFC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>ST/P003281/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>4C858634-C8F7-4807-AC13-C88C054062C5</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c851615e5511.07157152</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-04-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>One of the main objectives of this award was towards public engagement was the recent implementation of a collaboration network, entitled &amp;quot;Terra Preta de &amp;Iacute;ndio Network&amp;quot; (TPInet: http://tpinet.org). TPInet was initially created under the priorities of the RCUK - CONFAP Grant (NE/N000323/1) and later complemented by collaborative research developed in an NERC-IOF grant (NE/M017656/1). By joining diverse expertise that bring different capacities, practices, but more importantly perspectives, to work together, the remarkable collaborative potential of the TPInet is growing exponentially. This was demonstrated by the number of researchers (~90 persons) present at the 1st International Terra Preta de &amp;Iacute;ndio Symposium held in Curitiba, Brazil in June 2015. This research environment has enabled an ideal condition for the emergence of novel ideas and efficient, practical solutions to pressing environmental issues. This is particularly important when looking for bullet-proof alternatives that may sustain and relieve pressure on Brazilian natural resources, especially those in Amazonian and Atlantic Forests, biomes targeted in the current proposed project.

In 2016, the 2nd TPInet meeting was held in Porto Velho, Rond&amp;ocirc;nia, Brazil (23-24th February). In such meeting the main focus was satellite imaging and its applications to the main scientific objectives of the network.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The work is being used to inform policy on preservation of biodiversity in various Brazilian anthroprogenically created biomes.
