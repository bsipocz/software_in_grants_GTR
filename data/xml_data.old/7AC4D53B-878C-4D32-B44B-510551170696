The Wales Centre for Public Policy will help to provide this. It will host the Public Policy Institute for Wales (PPIW) and a new What Works Centre for Wales (WWW) that will work in tandem to make social science evidence available and useful to Welsh Ministers and public services. 

The Centre will mobilise evidence about what works in addressing a wide range of economic and social challenges. It will focus on issues such as the economy and work; education; health and social care; and communities, housing and the environment, which are highly relevant to the delivery of the Welsh Programme for Government, vital to the future prosperity of local communities in Wales, and address the ESRC's current priorities. 

The Centre's work will be demand led. It will take a developmental approach that responds directly to the evidence needs of Ministers and public services. It will co-produce its work programmes and disseminate the results through iterative and interactive processes of engagement with Ministers, Special Advisers, officials, public service leaders and other stakeholders. 

The PPIW will design and conduct a programme of work that provides Ministers with the best available evidence and advice to help to achieve their priorities. It will: (1) Support the First Minister and Cabinet Office to identify strategic cross-cutting issues; (2) Work with Ministers, Special Advisers, and officials to identify their evidence needs; (3) Provide advice on how to meet these needs; and (4) Develop and mobilise an extensive network of policy experts to produce and present short-turnaround reports and briefings.

WWW will work with public services and Public Service Boards to improve outcomes for local communities. It will support them to marshal, mobilise and generate research evidence that will help inform local strategies, policies and programmes. WWW's research will be relevant to, but independent of, government, and it will contribute to academic debates and networks - in Wales and beyond. It will: (1) Work with public services, service users and communities to determine what works, and what does not work, in promoting economic, social and environmental well-being; (2) Build up the capacity of public services to access and use evidence; (3) Generate and mobilise social science research to address contemporary societal challenges; and (4) Enable Wales to contribute to the UK wide What Works Network.

Drawing directly on its policy work for the Welsh Government and public services, the Centre will contribute new insights on three cross-cutting research themes: (1) What works in public service reform; (2) What works in policy making and implementation; and (3) What works in evidence use. All three of these issues are high on research agendas in a range of core disciplines including public policy, social policy, public administration and political science, and the Centre's work will, therefore, help to shape future research in these fields. Its research on public service reform will analyse approaches to prevention; service integration; innovation; and user and citizen engagement. Its research on policy making and implementation will focus on whether, and if so how, meso-level governments can mitigate the impact of reductions in public spending through the use of other 'policy resources'. Its research on evidence use will identify mechanisms that work best in enabling evidence generated by researchers to inform policy and practice.

The Centre's policy and research work will be relevant to policy makers, practitioners and researchers in other parts of the UK and internationally, and we will collaborate with professional and academic networks to facilitate comparative analysis and cross-jurisdictional learning.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The Centre's core rationale will be to promote and facilitate effective knowledge exchange between government/public services and academics/other policy experts. By growing and improving the evidence base about what works in tackling a wide range of contemporary economic and social challenges, the Centre will have direct benefits for:
1. Welsh Government Ministers, Special Advisers, officials and Members of the National Assembly for Wales.
2. Local politicians, managers and professionals working in Welsh health boards, local authorities and other Public Service Board partners. 
3. Other public sector, third sector, and private organisations charged with designing and delivering effective and efficient services in Wales.
4. Professional associations and bodies engaged in policy making and delivery, including the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives and the various professional networks involved in Public Services Boards.
5. Members of the public and local communities with an interest in, and benefit, from public service outcomes.

The Centre's work will have conceptual, instrumental and capacity building benefits for these groups.

Conceptual benefits - will be produced by enhancing understanding of what works in: stimulating economic growth; improving health outcomes; meeting increasing demand for, and costs of, social care; increasing educational attainment; providing affordable housing; and protecting the environment. It will also contribute new knowledge about the implications of Brexit; the impacts of devolving tax and borrowing powers; strategies for public service reform; approaches to policy making and implementation at the meso-level; and ways of enhancing evidence use.

Instrumental benefits - the Centre's work will directly inform, and hopefully help to improve, Ministerial decisions and local strategies. This will have potential to produce better outcomes for public service users and communities in Wales. It may also enable policy makers to identify programmes that are not effective and can be stopped.

Capacity building - the Centre will work with the Welsh Government and public services to increase their capacity to generate, transmit and use evidence. In this way, it will aim to embed 'what works' principles in policy processes - at national and local level. It will also seek to co-ordinate existing training in research methods and trials. And it will work with researchers, particularly those in the early stages of their careers, to assist them to engage with policy makers and public services in ways which apply their social science research and expertise to societal challenges.

In addition the Centre will produce evidence that may be useful to policy makers, practitioners and professional networks in other parts of the UK, and its work will be of interest to scholars working in a range of disciplines including public policy, social policy, public administration and political science.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2022-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>5001391</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/R00384X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F9D6F76D-4C6C-4E36-8E06-D471DED87098</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5BAFFA07-4055-4FE0-BE2D-FF47ECC4B6BF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Politics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B8E7153C-9FE1-4987-A37B-98408DC227F3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Public Administration</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E398036B-8D9A-43E0-BBBA-AF0932365C69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Public economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
