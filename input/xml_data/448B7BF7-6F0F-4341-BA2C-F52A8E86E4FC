Through closely-read case studies of varied art practices, this research investigates the concept of trauma in relation to psychoanalytical theories of the aesthetic. Specific issues arise at the meeting of aesthetics (art-producers and viewers), affectivity (modes of knowing and feeling) and ethics (witnessing and otherness). Trauma studies emerged in the humanities in the early 1990s in literary and historiographical studies. They drew on both neuroscience and Freudian theories of mourning, melancholia, acting out, working through and the return of the repressed: 'afterwardness'. They stressed the belated or latent character of extreme experiences that overwhelm the psyche's capacity to absorb, process or even record what has occurred. Unremembered, traumatic events generate affective traces that haunt an individual or, collectively, a culture. These traces may be 'worked through' in 'mediated, dialogical and symbolic doses' (Santner) in language and verbal representation. The study of trauma and the visual arts is a more recent development (Pollock, Bennett, Saltzman) and it raises challenging questions about dimensions of experience that, as trauma, apparently defy representation but can still be encountered or apprehended 'aesthetically' by transformations in artistic process, media and their materialities (Lyotard). This study asks: what are the relations between the event that 'causes' the art (personal or historical) and the nature of the viewer's witnessing, responding to or comprehending the 'pain of others' (Sontag). \nWriting of the Holocaust, Adorno argued that it was perhaps only in modernist aesthetic practices that extreme 'suffering can find a voice.' What of postmodern aesthetic forms as after-images? \nMy research examines the relation between trauma (theorized psychoanalytically as foundational void in subjectivity and as historically located events that defy inscription into memory) as it is registered in, translated through, and aesthetically transformed by, historically specific artistic practices dealing with varied personal and historical traumas in order to pose this question: what are the relations between the historical era of Modernity, generating so many traumatic after-effects, and its breach: Postmodernity? The latter sense of rupture and loss has been culturally negotiated by radical shifts from modernism's dominant theories and forms towards novel representational and aesthetic procedures. What role has trauma (extreme historical events such as the Holocaust) played in thus changing the cultural-aesthetic landscape? \nTrauma studies in the visual arts are not about therapeutic processes for the individual or for cultural collectivities: testimony or cure. My transdisciplinary research (psychoanalysis, art history, aesthetics, cultural theory) intersects shifting psychoanalytical thought about what trauma is and why it has become so salient now, with contemporary artistic practices, shaped both thematically and practically by being produced in a post-traumatic/post-modern condition. These practices use a range of media from post-conceptual painting to digital time-based video and installation. My research explores alignments between these post/modernist modes and affective apprehension of trauma. \nFinally, this research investigates these questions by identifying two trends around which the selected case studies can be clustered: the sounds of subjectivity and the memorial body. The first deals with real sound and metaphorical evocations of the voice, the call, and music. The second examines the potential status of the body as medium after the atrocities inflicted in the real and disseminated in representation from genocidal assaults and concentrationary tortures. Both the acoustic and embodiment/corporality feature critically in contemporary art and cultural theory.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit?\nIn addition to a substantial range of scholars and researchers working in this expanding field of interdisciplinary trauma and memory studies, and hence in different areas of the academy, the users of this research will include curators and museums, teachers, artists, psychoanalysts, and others dealing either with the legacies of traumatic violence (suffered by soldiers, asylum seekers, abuse survivors, torture victims) or with the processes of public commemoration and formal education. There are no immediate commercial or industrial applications of this research but it can produce value at a certain level because it provides a greater understanding facilitated through the processes of art (involving the encounter with the suffering of the other/who may also be like) of the psychological and cultural cost of atrocity and other extreme experiences ( from bereavement to mortal illness) and the manner in which art introduces new understanding of affect and of various ways of processing and translating trauma. The value to culture as a whole lies in the secondary understanding of the need for secondary witnesses to assist the witness /survivor to achieve restored recognition as a fellow human subject in relation to that which they have seen, suffered, endured and which may continue to affect them, their health and thus incur costs.\nHow will they benefit?\n This research which focuses, in part, on legacies of the Holocaust, forced migration and exile is an area in which research has accumulated across a range of disciplines . It now forms a substantial body of work from which agencies, institutions, and policymakers working with the current victims (and the perpetrators) of dehumanising, atrocious, traumatising events can learn. The conceptual frameworks and the discovered knowledge from analysing specific instances from the Holocaust to Rwanda and Cambodia are transferable, notably in the area of registering the transgenerational transmission of trauma. Traumatised subjects and indeed cultures carrying unprocessed traumatic freight do not escape unharmed: costs are to be calculated in psychological illness, inability to work, in difficult behaviours. Increased understanding offered by greater awareness of the ways in which artists, themselves bearers of traumatic histories, are introducing these areas into cultural awareness can reach out to many social, political and cultural communities and institutions. The intersection of aesthetics, psychoanalysis and history that underpins this research has already led me to be able to work with community groups such as Holocaust survivors and with relief workers attending refugees in Cambodia.\nWhat will be done to ensure they benefit?\n1. This work will be flagged up and publicized via the CentreCATH website and its 3000-strong data-base CentreCATH (formerly AHRC Centre for Cultural Analysis, Theory and History 2001-2006) under whose larger research Theme V: Amnesia, Historia, Memoria, this research project evolved has an established track record of collaborations with cultural institutions (Opera North, Tate Modern, Henry Moore Institute as well as international connections in the US, India, Taiwan and Europe). \n2. This research is disseminated through a book, journal article, and my speaking at different kinds of conferences reaching out to different audiences including community groups and the museum community.\nI shall aim to engage various elements of the media (notably radio) to draw attention to this area.\nPersonally, I have also a considerable track record, having curated an exhibition at the Freud Museum (with a small public programme aimed at schools and the psychoanalytical community on the work of one of the artists in this project, Bracha Ettinger and I have curated an exhibition on Migratory Aesthetics)\nI shall be seeking further grants and s</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-05-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>55667</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Trauma and Aesthetic Transformation</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:id>53E43FD5-F975-4DDA-AC6B-383D42A3DD26</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A symposium presenting the key findings of my research creating dialogue with artists, psychotherapists, psychoanalysts, and art therapists which was held under the auspices of the Freud Museum, London 18 February 2012

It proposed new theorizations of trauma drawing on an extended range of psychoanalytical models for trauma, notably using the theory of the Matrix proposed by Bracha Ettinger to explore the concept of art as a transport station of trauma. The focus on was on formulations of suffering, pathos formulae and suggested by a study of a range of artistic practices from the twentieth century that under the pressure of personal and historical trauma artists of the modernist and postmodernist eras have had to create new formulations for suffering . The focus of the project is on the function of the aesthetic in the transformation of trauma, and also, mostly importantly on the consequences of the failure of such transformative aesthetic work.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The work is of relevance to artists, art historians and psychoanalysts working with the impact of personal and historical trauma</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>AAD74B9C-897E-4270-A8E9-84BF6D56E492</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5460c6de321d87.79039098</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5F250CE0-2BED-4BA8-BFE1-54C1C9DBDDF6</gtr:id><gtr:title>After-Affects | After-Images: Trauma and Aesthetic Transformation in the Virtual Feminist Museum</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8a1cc30730ce790ca46baef301b85d01"><gtr:id>8a1cc30730ce790ca46baef301b85d01</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pollock Griselda</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780719087974</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>i_69042150493bf2eb9a</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7BADD576-D229-4DA1-8100-50EDEC785851</gtr:id><gtr:title>Impure Cinema: Intermedial and Intercultural Approaches to Film</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8a6608e4e8880205c143e5b9f516c764"><gtr:id>8a6608e4e8880205c143e5b9f516c764</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pollock, G.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781780765105</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>545cdcd345e951.22790610</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5079827B-7AED-4304-AD70-C2A845C2F111</gtr:id><gtr:title>Representing Auschwitz</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/70cbfa63cd4efaee84540674e95df9f2"><gtr:id>70cbfa63cd4efaee84540674e95df9f2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pollock G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1137297686</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>545cddd4c1a433.94784862</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I002901/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A41F90B5-A81F-42AC-908A-49DB7154F85A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Art Theory &amp; Aesthetics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>02EB1D72-607A-4467-BF3A-A60E567738E9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Time-Based Media HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
