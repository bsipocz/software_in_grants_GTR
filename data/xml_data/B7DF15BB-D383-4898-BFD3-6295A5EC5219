Specifically, the PMT will be responsible for:
- Monitoring research progress
- Budget monitoring 
- Facilitating communication, collaboration and integration among the consortia
- Facilitating data management for the Programme
- Planning impact and knowledge exchange activities
- Logistics support
Key Programme management activities are described below.

PROGRAMME COORDINATION AND DATA MANAGEMENT: To assist the PMT in fulfilling their responsibilities, the PMT will appoint a Programme Coordinator to help them in research and budget monitoring, report writing, and managing communication across the Programme (e.g. organising annual meetings, website development and maintenance, etc.). The HMTF Programme will also appoint a Programme Data Manager who will: (1) Assist in development of data nomenclature, archiving and metadata protocols; (2) Ensure well documented data collection and data encoding; (3) Support importing of new data into the existing databases; (4) Facilitate compatibility of data between the various databases, including suggesting modifications of existing databases and nomenclature; (5) Ensure and develop comprehensive metadata and data set descriptions through frequent liaison with all investigators; (6) Report to the PMT and NERC, on data management needs and progress. The outline Data Management Plan for the HMTF Programme is presented in Appendix B. 

PROGRAMME COMMUNICATION: Communication within consortia, among consortia and with external actors will be facilitated by the development of a HMTF Programme website, with separate portals for each of the consortia. Among-consortia communication will be further facilitated by a meetings budget that includes funds for bringing Brazilian and Malaysian partners together with the UK-based researchers. 

IMPACT AND KNOWLEDGE EXCHANGE: The PMT will also coordinate the impact and knowledge exchangee activities of the three consortia. Specifically, the PMT will: (1) provide KE support during the initial stage of fieldwork, when projects are establishing field sites and liaising with multiple stakeholders including private landholders and reserve managers; and (2) support the dissemination of results, in particular providing detailed feedback to key stakeholders, including landholders, relevant industries, and local and national government departments. Programme funds will support these activities in Malaysia and Brazil through non-academic Knowledge Exchange officers who will be tasked with preparing dissemination materials and meeting with stakeholders. These will be hired on short-term contracts, providing the PMT with crucial KE support when and where it is most needed. Delivery of the impact plans put forward by the individual consortia will be devolved to the KE officers who will lead a unified, cross-consortia approach to delivering impact. 

LOGISTICS SUPPORT: The HMTF Programme will provide funds for logistics in Malaysia and Brazil. Malaysian funds have been allocated to support SAFE/SEARRP and the costs of the NERC-ARSF. For Brazil, funds will be allocated to support transport costs, offsetting unforeseen budget reductions by FAPESP in this area.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The Programme will engage with stakeholders (e.g. academics, policy makers, forestry and agribusiness industries, the conservation sector) by: 
- Hosting workshops that involve scientists, policy makers and industry
- Producing management and policy relevant publications
- Working directly with sustainability working groups
- Giving public lectures and holding university short courses
- Depositing biological samples in regional and national archives
- Holding wider public outreach events
- Producing short films and engaging directly with the press

WORKSHOPS: The Programme will host workshops to facilitate knowledge exchange among scientists, policy makers and industry, funded through the Programme meeting budget. Programme members will also attend policy and industry events (workshops, conferences) to present our findings and policy recommendations.

MANAGEMENT AND POLICY RELEVANT PUBLICATIONS: Despite the relevance of many academic publications, policy makers and industry stakeholders rarely read or have knowledge of the academic literature. To address this problem, we will provide regular journal reports and policy briefings to policy makers, industry and industry journals with a focus on the practical outcomes of our research. These activities will be funded by consortia impact budgets.

FEEDBACK TO SUSTAINABILITY WORKING GROUPS: Members of the Programme are participants in sustainability working groups and will provide policy-relevant findings to them. For example, members of the Programme are active in the Royal Society South East Asia Rainforest Research Programme (SEARRP), which has a key advisory role on the RSPO, making it an ideal channel by which results from this project can be fed through to policy makers. 

PUBLIC LECTURES, SHORT COURSES AND ACADEMIC EXCHANGE: We plan to give public lectures and run a series of short courses in association with our Malaysian and Brazilian Project Partners. These sessions will be associated with existing university courses (for example, field courses currently run by local academic institutions, or overseas field courses led by UK HEIs), and will showcase methods to monitor biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Where possible, we will also promote international, cross-institutional exchanges for PhD students and post-docs in Malaysia and Brazil through relevant budgets within individual consortia and our Programme-level meeting fund.

BIOLOGICAL MATERIAL: In accordance with local policies, all primary biological specimens will be deposited at existing collections in Malaysia and Brazil. These will provide a valuable resource for future ecological work in the region.

OUTREACH EVENTS: Project participants will organize a series of research &amp;quot;open days&amp;quot;, where local people and key stakeholders can accompany and observe research in the field on Brazil and Malaysia. Key focus groups will include: (a) teachers and students from local educational institutions, (b) local syndicates and workers unions, and (c) local landholders and relevant private business. At the end of the project, we will also run a stand in association with the Royal Society's Summer Exhibition, which showcases cutting-edge science and technology research. More generally, results of the work will be integrated with other outreach events run regularly as part of public engagement activities to showcase research at institutions involved in this Programme.

FILMS AND MEDIA ENGAGEMENT: Project participants across the different consortia will also undertake radio and television interviews, stimulated through press releases and by developing relationships with local media networks. ECOFOR's impact plan will support the development of a series of short films to promote awareness of the scientific research in development and policy contexts, where necessary using highly respected film companies to assist with film production (e.g. Viva! Pictures http://www.taniacypriano.com/).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>560381</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>The Royal Society</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>The South East Asia Rainforest Research Partnership (SEARRP)</gtr:description><gtr:id>28B91451-1ABF-458F-AC0E-6B27F812E799</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Studentships and further funding applications.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56bcb5764191f3.18291996-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Research assistance and operational support in the field including training.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Our scientists have been closely working with the Royal Society Southeast Asia Rainforest Research Programme (SEARRP) to recruit and train local research assistants and students in the laboratory and field.

Consortia within the HMTF programme have engaged in and contributed to regional and local policy-making activities. For example, members of the HMTF programme contributed to a 3-day workshop on oil palm sustainability, 2-4 November 2016. The workshop was coordinated by the Institute for Tropical Biology and Conservation at Universiti Malaysia Sabah (ITBC-UMS) and LOMBOK, led by Durrell Institute of Conservation and Ecology at University of Kent, UK (DICE-Kent). Researchers from Oxford University and the South East Asia Rainforest Research Partnership (SEARRP), as well as oil palm stakeholders in Malaysia participated. 

Members of the BALI consortium have also contributed to the development of sustainable management strategies for the oil palm industry. For example, PIs Burslem and Teh provided expert opinions, input, and advice on a technical report for the RSPO which helps define best-practice guidelines for conserving carbon in oil palm landscapes and mitigating climate change. The final report is entitled &amp;quot;The High Carbon Stock Science Study: Independent Report from the Technical Committee.&amp;quot;

In addition, members of the ECOFOR project have produced a series of 5 policy briefs to inform the general public about their findings. These were first presented at the RAS (Rede Amazonia Sustentavel) symposium in December 2016. These policy briefs compile data from 7 years of research in the state of Par&amp;aacute;, combining socio-economic and environmental data and address research on wildfires, the impacts of forest degradation, streams and rivers, efficient environmental regularisation and ways to sustainable landscapes. http://simposioamazoniasustentavel.org/ 

PUBLIC OUTREACH
Researchers across the programme have participated in a number of public outreach events, including presentations to the general public, primary and secondary schools, and training (capacity building) events within their host countries. For example, BALI team members were involved in a Nature Live Public Lecture at the Natural History Museum, open day events throughout the UK (e.g. Doors Open Day in Aberdeen), guest lectures at primary and secondary schools in Malaysia and elsewhere, and training of local research assistants and volunteers on invertebrate identification and dung beetle sampling (BALI and LOMBOK). ECOFOR organised a &amp;quot;Tesouros do Vale do Paraiba&amp;quot; event held in Sao Luiz do Paraitinga consisting of over 200 people, including school children, community leaders and tourists. A workshop on orchid identification skills at the Picinguaba Nucleus of the Serra do Mar State Park (PESM), Ubatuba, Brazil, was given to 17 PESM staff, who can use these skills to improve local diversity knowledge. Preliminary results have been presented at the &amp;quot;7th International Canopy Conference&amp;quot; held at the University of Roehampton in London and &amp;quot;Exposici&amp;oacute;n orqu&amp;iacute;deas 2016&amp;quot;, at the Bogot&amp;aacute; Botanic garden, Colombia.

MULTIMEDIA
Short educational films have been produced across the programme. LOMBOK has produced a short introductory overview about their project and has worked with members of the BALI consortium and SEARRP to produce a joint film specifically focusing on the Malaysian part of the HMTF programme to showcase our research and objectives. Educational videos on biogeochemical cycling, mammals, invertebrate dispersal, leeches, dung beetles, and birds are also being developed. The films are geared towards the general public and will be displayed on the HMTF consortia websites and disseminated via social networks (www.hmtf.info).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>EB1A719A-C475-4657-B0E6-119833A43CEB</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56bb41fe5d2fd6.72999298</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Consortia within the HMTF programme have published articles in highly cited scientific journals, generating media coverage in local magazines (e.g. Amaz&amp;ocirc;nia Viva), the news (e.g. Brazilian newspapers, O Globo and Folha de S&amp;atilde;o Paulo) and TV/Radio. This included a Daily Mail article on the discovery of one of the tallest trees recorded in the tropics (a Yellow Meranti tree with a height equal to 20 double-decker buses) using airborne LiDAR scanning. The ECOFOR consortium led on a Nature article entitled 'Anthropogenic disturbance in tropical forests can double biodiversity loss from deforestation' published in June 2016. The article presented results showing that even when preserving 80% forest cover, as per the Brazilian Forest Code, landscapes may only maintain c.50% of their biodiversity value. The article attracted considerable media attention, including a BBC news video interviewing Dr Jos Barlow, http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-36656443 and many other TV, Radio and newspaper coverage in the UK, Brazil and the USA. The study clearly demonstrates the need for policy interventions that go beyond the maintenance of forest cover to safeguard the hyper-diversity of tropical forest ecosystems. 

HMTF researchers and members of the programme management group have also engaged in and contributed to international policy-making activities, informed by the research of the HMTF Programme. This includes the work of the Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) which aims to promote the growth and use of sustainable oil palm products through credible global standards and partnerships. Engagement with the oil palm industry included HMTF sessions and presentations at ICOPE (International Conference of Oil Palm and Environment) in Bali, Indonesia, 15-18th March 2016. Regional engagement and knowledge exchange in Sabah included a knowledge exchange and stakeholder consultation meeting hosted by HMTF researchers in Tawau. The 35 participants included oil palm plantation managers and directors of Benta Wawasan and Sabah Softwoods, as well as other key stakeholders from Yayasan Sabah and Sabah Forest Department. We presented an update on HMTF research activities in Sabah focusing on soil emissions, carbon stocks and biodiversity. Feedback from plantation managers will be used to refine our research plans. Our plans for spatial analyses and our request input on policy scenarios and economic/management data generated substantial debate and interest, and led to a commitment to provide profit and management cost data at the level of individual coupes. Furthermore one of the PIs, Carlos A. Joly from the State University of Campinas, UNICAMP, Brazil has been participating intensively in the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services/IPBES, as member of the Multidisciplinary Experts Panel/MEP, member of IPBES Task Force in Capacity Building and of the Management Committee of the ongoing Americas Regional Assessment. 

Data manager, Finella Blair, has outlined NERC's data management policy to each consortium and the HMTF programme has a customised database to track over 150 consortium members, potential datasets and their metadata. 285 potential data sets have been identified across the programme. The HMTF data management database can now identify datasets with environmental data across the three consortia, increasing the opportunity for collaboration between research groups and modellers. A resource web page, outlining data management best practice resources, institutional guidelines and NERC/EIDC information has been developed and is now available on the HMTF website (http://hmtf.info/). 

We continue to upload blogs, newsfeeds, photos and videos of our researchers in the field on our consortia websites (www.hmtf.info) in order to disseminate information to the public as widely as possible. The website also lists our numerous engagement activities with industry, academia and the wider public.The HMTF programme management meetings held every 2 months involving PI's from BALI, ECOFOR and LOMBOK.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>By supporting the dissemination of project results.
