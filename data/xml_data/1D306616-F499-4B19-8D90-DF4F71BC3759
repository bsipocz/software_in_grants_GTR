Often termed 'the Burgundian Netherlands' for this reason, the region boasted a dynamic culture, including literature in both French and Dutch. Many historians have assumed that works in French were largely consumed by the Dukes and their aristocratic entourage, while those in Dutch were aimed at urban merchant classes. Recent research, however, has suggested that French- and Dutch-speakers interacted in some significant ways. (Dutch-speaking printers published books in French, for example, while Dutch theatre companies took part in French-language drama festivals and vice-versa.) The project will improve our understanding of this interaction. It will benefit not only the numerous scholars of the Burgundian Netherlands, but also academic researchers in related fields such as cross-cultural relations.\n\nWe will shed light on the exchange between the region's French- and Dutch-language communities by editing poetry produced by each community in the period 1450-1530. This will involve transcribing poems from manuscripts and early printed books; indicating how the various sources of each poem present different versions, and identifying which versions are best; and supplying the introductions, explanatory notes, and linguistic glossaries that make up the normal 'apparatus' for scholarly editions. Our apparatus will pay particular attention to the interaction between cultures, noting features such as linguistic and stylistic borrowing from the other language. We will edit work by a particularly important author in each language, whose poetry badly needs a new edition - Anthonis de Roovere in Dutch (d. 1482) and Jean Molinet in French (1435-1507) - as well as an anthology of poems in both languages, about current affairs in the region, which have not previously been edited. The total corpus will comprise 300-320 poems of different lengths, from a few lines to around twenty pages (a very few pieces are longer than this; the vast majority range between 20 and 200 lines). English translations will be supplied in the anthology and the De Roovere edition, to make them more accessible to non-specialists.\n\nBesides producing the editions, we will invite experts on the Burgundian Netherlands to a conference about the region's cross-cultural relations. Here we will present our ongoing editorial findings, and the invited participants will present their own research on the subject. The event will help us develop the editions on the basis of specialist scrutiny, while also ensuring that they inform other research in the field. Papers from the conference will then be collected for publication in a book.\n\nOur research will also benefit a wider public by offering a different picture of medieval Europe, more diverse and respectful of other languages and communities than is generally supposed. We will reach this public by holding an exhibition in Manchester, and by writing articles on our subject for popular history journals (e.g. 'History Today') in different countries.\n\nOur work will be based on collaboration by an international team of experienced scholarly editors, two in the UK and three key collaborators based in mainland Europe. Each team member is a specialist in Dutch or French literature of the period, and can read scholarly work in the other language. We will each edit texts in the language of our own specialism, but will share our findings and pool our skills by reporting on our reading, submitting drafts for discussion to an online forum, and discussing each other's work at regular team meetings. (The online forum will also include a public portion, to inform wider academic and non-academic publics of our work.) By working together in this way, we will identify cross-cultural elements in the poems we are editing. Hence each edition will draw on the entire team's expertise in French-and Dutch- language cultures.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project is devised not only to meet researchers' and students' needs, but also to generate indirect benefits beyond academia. Public interest in medieval history is strong, as attested by the audiences for historical fiction and for popular history (both written and broadcast). Yet these audiences often receive a homogenized image of the Middle Ages, as an era of near-universal ignorance and prejudice. Our project corrects this image by revealing how different language communities could draw on each other's cultures. It can therefore enhance public understanding of the history of cultural diversity. In so doing, it has the potential to improve quality of life. In multicultural societies, linguistic diversity tends to be seen as inhibiting interaction between communities: witness the media debates around the role of English-language requirements in immigration policy. By contrast, our project will demonstrate that such diversity can play a positive role in enhancing cross-cultural understanding. Burgundian poets absorbed expressions and techniques from another vernacular into their own, often disseminating the results widely through public performance or printing. In the process they not only enriched their language - for both themselves and their audiences - but also implicitly promoted respect for the culture of another language. Hence our project has an exemplary story to tell: by engaging with cultural products in another language, people can become more fulfilled members of a more cohesive society. This is no small issue in modern societies that are increasingly polyglot.\n\nThe most obvious beneficiaries of these insights are not public policy makers (for whom the benefits are at most indirect and long-term) but the general public (including schools) and the creative/heritage sector, notably insofar as the former consumes the latter's activities. Outside the UK there is particular potential for public interest in Belgium, where the vast majority of our corpus was produced, and where political discourse and news media often distort the complex relations between language communities. We believe we can engage these beneficiaries within the project's lifetime. An exhibition in Manchester, with accompanying activities and resources, has been scheduled for July-November 2014; team members will also submit articles on aspects of the project to popular history journals in the UK and overseas. Further details are supplied within the 'Pathways to Impact' section.\n\nFinally, the books and exhibition will produce economic benefits for their publishers and hosts.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>227036</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Manchester</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>John Rylands Library</gtr:department><gtr:description>Communities in Communication</gtr:description><gtr:id>75CDD299-C607-4CC2-AC0F-55A4440ADDB5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Library exhibition (Manchester) - see 'Engagement Activities'

During the period of the exhibition, a total of 68,738 visits were made to the Library; this figure indicates the number of visitors who had the opportunity to view the exhibition.
The Library collects visitor feedback on its exhibitions in general, rather than on individual exhibitions. However, 'Communities in Communication' was the principal exhibition during its run, and Library staff are therefore confident that it weighed heavily in visitor evaluations. By the end of September 2014, these evaluations gave the Library exhibitions an average rating of 4.3/5. Remarks in comment cards completed by visitors over this period include: 'We never cease to be amazed by the quality of the exhibits', 'very interesting exhibits', and 'the exhibits were well thought out. Digestible within the span of a short visit and very interesting'.

We have established that translations from French to Dutch often share in the competitive approach to composition that characterizes both French- and Dutch-language poetic culture of the period. Translations tend to elaborate on their sources, producing greater formal complexity. When vocabulary is borrowed from the other language, this often occurs at key points in poems, e.g. the rhyme. The diversity of the region's book trade, and the cultural and linguistic importance of Latin and other vernaculars (notably English), have proved important factors; they caution against treating the relationship between French- and Dutch-language cultures in overly binary terms. Finally, transcultural interactions took place not only through composition and translation, but also through public performance, book production, and patronage relationships. All these issues enhance our wider understanding of transcultural exchange in pre-modern societies.
Work on critical editions of poetry from the region has also yielded important findings. The abundant work of Jean Molinet was transmitted in both manuscript and print; these two traditions prove more alike than had previously been supposed. Research for a multilingual anthology of topical poetry has revealed previously unedited material, and enriched understanding of how this poetry circulated in urban as well as courtly environments. Further findings are likely to emerge as editorial work continues.
Improved editorial methodology has developed. Molinet's poems often vary significantly between witnesses, e.g. because a topical composition has been updated to refer to later events. These different versions have their own integrity; this cannot be captured by traditional editorial apparatus, where readings that vary from the edited version are grouped by location rather than witness (i.e. all the variants for a given line appear together, then all those for the next line, etc.). To present different versions more clearly, an apparatus was developed that presents all the successive variants in one witness before those in the next. This approach has not, to our knowledge, previously been used in editing medieval Romance texts. It has revealed distinctive qualities in various versions. One religious poem, for instance, quotes heavily from contemporary love poetry; in one version, which appears in an anthology of religious verse, the quotations are systematically replaced by more pious expressions. Several poems by Anthonis de Roovere have been handled similarly. Some witnesses vary so much that they can be considered as distinct texts, not acknowledged as such by previous editors; some pieces, originally destined for performance, were adapted for reading when published in print.
Team members' research capability has developed significantly, through collaboration and sharing of resources, and through ongoing interactions with participants in a 2013 colloquium. We have each developed our linguistic and philological understanding beyond our own specialisms. This has enabled team members to undertake ongoing work on related subjects, and allowed the completion and publication of additional scholarly articles relating to the project.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In academic contexts, experts in the culture and history of the Burgundian Netherlands, and medieval literary scholars specializing in French and Dutch, are likely to engage with the project's insights when considering the relationships between language/s, literature/s, and society. Theorists of cross-cultural exchange, and specialists in literary translation studies, may enrich their understanding of cultural, linguistic, and aesthetic processes through the evidence we provide. When the critical editions are completed, editors of early texts produced in transcultural situations (e.g. Anglo-Norman material) may adopt their methodological lessons, while historical linguists will have a resource for research into the history of language contact. In non-academic contexts, a library-based exhibition (Manchester 2014) and popular history journal article have enabled a wider public to appreciate not only that the Burgundian Netherlands was transcultural, but also that medieval societies could be more tolerant and diverse than is often assumed. In the cultural/heritage sector, curators might take account of these perspectives when devising exhibitions. More specifically, library exhibition curators will be able to draw on a journal article recounting the experience of assembling and selecting books in different languages and media (manuscript/print).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>9C87AEAB-6556-4F66-BAFE-806C2F40689F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56cb77b7bc6124.43009799</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>77162E18-7292-4FA7-B60D-837AD7920870</gtr:id><gtr:title>Discovering New Media: Anthonis de Roovere and the Early Printing Press [in] Urban Culture and Ideologies in Medieval and Early Modern Europe: c.1100-1600</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/41421dd6055cbb07d3a0ab1f1d847207"><gtr:id>41421dd6055cbb07d3a0ab1f1d847207</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Oosterman J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>56cb8a00081837.76362370</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>DDB16BA0-7CC2-4E8F-983F-294CB0410AA1</gtr:id><gtr:title>'Imprim&amp;eacute; en la ville marchande et renomm&amp;eacute;e d'Anvers': Antwerp Editions of Jean Molinet's poetry</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Queeste</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a442c5716abce22a833413a969cc0dbd"><gtr:id>a442c5716abce22a833413a969cc0dbd</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Armstrong A.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>09298592</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58beba503812c6.92885777</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7D57D42E-3625-4487-9EF7-13019D097B15</gtr:id><gtr:title>Translating Poetic Capital in Fifteenth-Century Brussels: From Am&amp;eacute; de Montgesoie's Pas de la Mort to Colijn Caillieu's Dal sonder Wederkeeren</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Queeste</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/447631a66439719e2e8db99a1423ec2b"><gtr:id>447631a66439719e2e8db99a1423ec2b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Armstrong A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56cb8d180b8374.76304963</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E0B6BF7F-A69D-4ECB-8358-38BB60D78F7D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Th&amp;eacute;orie et pratique, aller et retour: L'Art de Rh&amp;eacute;torique et la po&amp;eacute;sie de Jean Molinet dans deux recueils manuscrits</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/bfa3a89b5c5e42cd6b73bfd7e10f1cd7"><gtr:id>bfa3a89b5c5e42cd6b73bfd7e10f1cd7</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>armstrong a</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>54501918941171.17560540</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3A706C1D-D4EE-4CCE-9F5A-922246E10E99</gtr:id><gtr:title>A Curator's Perspective:
