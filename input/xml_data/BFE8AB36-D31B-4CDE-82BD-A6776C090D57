Cells orchestrate division cycles by coordinating intracellular proteins with an incredible accuracy and, indeed, precise timing of division avoids abnormal proliferation of cells that ultimately leads to Cancer. 

We live in an exciting time in scientific research where most of the proteins that drive biological responses, such as cell division, are know. The challenge we face as researchers is moving from this descriptive state to predicting what happens to these intracellular protein networks when the microenvironment of a cell changes. What happens when a cell is hijacked by a pathogen? What happens when a cell undergoes malignancy? What is that new cellular state like? It is our conviction that one way to answer these questions is to be able to understand how protein networks change inside the cell as the environment (or biological context) of that cell changes.

The quantitative biology group uses multi-disciplinary approaches, combining state-of-the-art molecular biology methods with mathematical modeling to try and understand how cell division proteins collectively change when a cell transitions from one cell state to another in a in vitro model for human embryonic development. We envision that these studies will have profound impact in our understanding of health and disease states. More globally, understanding the principles on how the cells? own clock-makers work together will shed light into the fundamental, complex and beautiful process that cell division is.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>During cell decision-making signal transduction networks dynamically change in time and space in response to cues, and thereby trigger different cellular states. The decision to divide is one of the most fundamental cellular responses and the evolutionarily conserved networks that control cell division adapt and remodel in a variety of biological contexts - during development and homeostasis, infections and malignancy, in response to drugs and stresses. A striking example of this versatility occurs during development where the same core regulators drive structurally different divisions. Divisions in the embryo are clock-like, fast, short and synchronous with no checkpoints or gap phases. With time, these divisions become longer and asynchronous. The resulting somatic like cycles have checkpoint control and gap phases, and the initiation of events is dependent on completion of early events, just like a falling domino. The question, thus, arises on how do the same cell cycle regulators self-organize and remodel in time and space to generate structurally different cell division cycles?

The quantitative cell biology group addresses this question by using embryonic stem cells as a model for the embryonic cell cycle and monitors the activities, concentrations and spatial distribution of key cell cycle regulators in single cells, during differentiation into somatic cardiomyocytes. Our research program combines experimental and theoretical approaches, based on single cell advanced live cell imaging and mass spectrometry, reverse engineering, modelling and computations..

These approaches will allow us to quantitatively derive topologies of cell cycle networks under embryonic and somatic cellular contexts and uncover how remodelling happens during embryonic to somatic divisions. Multidisciplinary approaches such as those used in our group have revolutionized the way we ask biological questions and perform experiments and such a combination of approaches to understand transition states in signalling networks is likely to have profound implications for understanding normal development and disease states. More globally our research program will shed light into the organizing principles within signalling networks that emerge during cell decision-making.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1783700</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Francis Crick Institute</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Co-supervisor of PhD students at the Francis Crick Institute in London</gtr:description><gtr:id>A7412FA6-068B-493F-B23E-44F3DF361013</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Both PhD projects are multi-disciplinary projects (biology, mathematics and computer science).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c054b43851d5.78230559-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Have co-supervised two PhD students with me</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Co-supervisor of two PhD students at the Francis Crick Institute currently working in the labs of Dr Frank Uhlmann and Prof Paul Nurse working on cell cycle regulation in yeast.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Organiser and lecturer of Systems and Synthetic Biology week for PhD, University of Porto, Portugal</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>69892B26-B76A-4C77-B6DC-5015E2C4B0C4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I have organised and lectured a week long workshop on Systems and Synthetic Biology at Porto University.

In addition, I teach a small workshop on public speaking where by the end of the week students use the techniques just taught to present systems biology papers. Since 2014, the last day of the workshop is a mini symposium where I invite external speakers and an editor from a scientific journal to illustrate current research in system biology.
