Building on feasibility work on a FORD
model, the aim of this project is to assess the technical &amp;amp; commercial feasibility of developing
a device that can override any vehicles immobilizer (an electronic anti-theft device fitted in a
vehicle) &amp;amp; allow the vehicle to be driven without the correct key. The demand for the
proposed technology is derived from a number of key industries requiring the technology for
different uses.
It is estimated that between the UK?s largest recovery companies, c 41,000 call outs occur
each year for lost/broken/stolen keys (RAC alone). Without the correct key, the vehicles
immobilizer system prevents the engine from running &amp;amp; the vehicle cannot be driven. Current
solutions involve recovery companies towing a vehicle back to either a main car dealer, or to
the member?s home address which may be several hundred miles away. This is costly (circa
&amp;pound;160 per recovery), and environmentally unfriendly (circa 3000 tonnes of CO2 per year just
from lost key scenarios) (App A). Alternatively, auto-locksmiths can attend the site of the
vehicle, gain entry to re-set the vehicles immobilizer and cut a new key. This involves
expensive diagnostic equipment and can take up to 2 hours.
Demand also comes from the emergency services sector, local councils and the MOD. In the
case of a crisis, emergency services need time and space to arrive at the location which is
often blocked due to parked vehicles. The proposed device would offer the only solution
where a vehicle had to be moved quickly with no damage. Typical scenarios could be:
removal of vehicles blocking access routes or in a hazardous position, near fires, bomb
warnings etc. vehicles can be quickly moved from site reducing public risk; removal of
abandoned vehicles to support local Councils; law enforcement could use the technology for
removing vehicles for general seizures, evidence, non Tax license, uninsured holders etc,
eliminating mechanical damage and cost to public services; also various military and police
applications where vehicles need to be confiscated or obtained for examination.
1st Call Lockouts believe their unique technology &amp;amp; approach will successfully tackle the
issues identified, and with grant funding will do so more immediately within the desired
timeframe and cost. The proposed technology will enable the immobiliser system on any
vehicle to be temporarily disabled, allowing the vehicle to be started with an approved lock
pick (provided with the device). This would allow a complete onsite solution to the problem,
negating the need for a tow vehicle or expensive diagnostic equipment and human
intervention. In the case of the emergency services/local councils/MOD, they could gain entry
to any vehicle and move it without causing any damage; a quick and easy solution to a
significant problem and an escalating cost burden. If successful, prototyping will follow with
expected market entry within 12 months</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100015</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">710006</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
