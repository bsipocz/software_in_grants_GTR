Community</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>G0900040</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Regular physical activity affects both physical and mental health in older people. It helps to prevent major diseases, reduces the risk of depression and dementia and is a important for social contact and independent living. However, the best ways to encourage and help older people to increase their daily activity are not well understood. The aim of the proposed Avon Network for the Promotion of Active Ageing in the Community is to develop a forum for sharing information on the promotion of physical activity in older people. This will include older people themselves as well as university-based researchers, health service providers and leisure activity providers. These ?key stakeholders? will develop recommendations for physical activity programmes for older people living in the community. They will also develop proposals for future research to further develop and evaluate such programmes. The activities of the proposed network will be as follows:-

1. We will hold a series of meetings involving all the key stakeholders as well as invited speakers.
2. We will draw together evidence from existing research on people aged 70 or over. This will aim to identify all the influences that affect people?s physical activity and include the views of local residents. We will also look at and summarise research which assesses the effectiveness of existing programmes to promote physical activity. 
3. We will re-examine data from existing research studies and local service delivery evaluations where this might help to inform our recommendations on what might work to promote physical activity in older people. 
4. Working together, the stakeholders will compare different approaches to promoting physical activity by looking at how much evidence there is to support their use. They will also assess how practical they are likely to be for local use.
5. We will set up group discussions to ask for the views of older people from different neighbourhoods and communities about the different approaches we identify for promoting physical activity. 
6. We will draw together the results of the above activities to produce a series of options and recommendations for promoting physical activity in older people.

The proposed applicants and collaborators have an excellent track record of research and service delivery in this area and are well placed to successfully achieve the aims of this proposal.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Regular physical activity is not only important for physical function and freedom from disease in the elderly, but also increases mental well-being, reducing the risk of depression and dementia and is an important vehicle for social interaction and maintenance of independent living. However, the best ways to encourage and facilitate older people to increase their daily activity are not well understood and research in this area is in its infancy. The aim of the proposed Avon Network for the Promotion of Active Ageing in the Community is to develop an interdisciplinary forum for translational research and knowledge exchange, involving key stakeholders in the promotion of physical activity in older people. The collaborators will develop recommendations for, and prepare funding bids to develop and evaluate physical activity programmes for older people living in the Avon community. This will be achieved by:-

1. Holding a series of facilitated meetings involving multidisciplinary academic collaborators, key informants (invited external speakers), health and leisure service delivery agencies and relevant service user groups in the Avon region.
2. Identifying and (descriptively) synthesising evidence from studies of people aged 70+ that identify determinants of physical activity and evaluate the effectiveness of interventions to promote activity. 
3. Re-analysing and collating existing qualitative and quantitative data from samples of Avon residents such as Project OPAL, Bristol Quality of Life survey, WE-based Solutions, and local service delivery evaluations. 
4. Contrasting and comparing approaches to physical activity promotion against evidence-based and pragmatic criteria for intervention which will be developed by the network partners.
5. Using qualitative research methods to assess reactions by target user groups from diverse neighbourhoods and communities to different service delivery options. 
6. Synthesising the results of the above activities to produce a set of options and recommendations for physical activity promotion for older people.
7. Preparing at least one substantial research proposal draft for funding to develop /pilot and test the effectiveness of different recommended approaches to physical activity promotion for submission in 2010 to LLHW. 

By the end of the grant period, the project will therefore deliver several outputs including research papers (from the literature reviewing and qualitative work), a consensus document outlining recommendations for physical activity promotion for older people and at least one research funding proposal. The proposed applicants and collaborators have an excellent track record of research and service delivery in this area and are well placed to successfully achieve the aims of this proposal.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>48058</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Maryland</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:department>School of Medicine Maryland</gtr:department><gtr:description>Collaboration with US academics</gtr:description><gtr:id>1E54276F-CAC6-4363-BCB2-7A529CD623EA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This is a multisdciplinary collaboration involving academics (psychology, public health, sociology, epidemiology), practitioners, and policy makers.

They will also provide personnel and computing resources necessary to analyse, store and backup these data. This is therefore a great opportunity to add considerable value both to Project REACT and their own research programme, as they can benefit from the intervention that Project REACT will be delivering, and the REACT trial would gain important secondary outcome measures that will add significantly to the understanding of biological mechanisms underling any detected changes in behaviour or function.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Project REACT is a 54 month RCT which aims to recruit 758 older adults over the age of 65.

After my talk, representatives from several organisations asked my to send them further information about the initiatives presented in the AVONet report and featured in my talk. Representatives expressed their interest to implement one of the initiatives, Project ACE, in their communities.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>93307001C6A</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Health professionals</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2009</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Knowledge Transfer</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E9BCA1E4-9CD5-48E1-AE78-1B7A7F894842</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Anglesey Knowledge Transfer Partnership organised an AgeWell Learning Exchange day event in Beaumaris, Wales on 8th July which was attended by health professionals and policy makers.
