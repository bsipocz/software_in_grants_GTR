We house rolling thematic science-based exhibitions based on our University's science research aimed at two target audiences: school students and the wider public. Our exhibitions are accessible, informative and interactive, focusing on the work and collaborations of the University's STEMM community. Oriel Science also hosts schools workshops in parallel with each exhibition. We take visitors on a journey through a scientific theme, ignite their curiosity to explore that theme, and leave a lasting legacy in their imagination. We inspire younger visitors to choose STEM subjects at school leading to STEM degrees in University, and further develop the science capital and scientific literacy of older visitors.

Oriel Science is the only exhibition space run by a UK University which showcases its research to the community.

Oriel Science's venue is in the city centre in the pedestrianised shopping mall allowing wonderful access to our exhibition. Our current theme is &amp;quot;Time&amp;quot; and visitors are welcomed by a &amp;quot;Back to the Future&amp;quot; DeLorean &amp;quot;time machine&amp;quot;, a Tardis, and (leaving the fiction behind) a mock-up of the STFC Large Hadron Collider, the world's biggest machine which studies the physics of the early universe. More than a dozen other exhibits showcase the science of time including an app taking the visitor on a journey close to a Black Hole illustrating time dilation, a time-lapse video of a glacial calving event from Greenland, and various particle detectors such as a cloud chamber, a solid state detector based on the technology used in CERN, and a cosmic ray detector. Across one wall we have our 100 foot &amp;quot;Time Wall&amp;quot; animation of the history of the universe starting with the Big Bang which zooms in on particularly interesting stages of the Universe such as the first few moments after its birth. At the end of this Time Wall is the &amp;quot;Future Wall&amp;quot; where visitors are encouraged to write their own thoughts on paper about what the future might hold. Throughout the duration of the exhibition, these ideas are raised on a pulley system to the ceiling, 6 metres high.

In our first 6 months of opening, we have had over 12,000 public visitors with a further 800 students visiting during organised school trips. We are hugely popular with 94% of visitors stating that they'd recommend us to a friend and 92% saying that they'd learnt more about science as a result of their visit. We have had significant media exposure on TV both nationally and locally, on BBC and local radio, and in the local press.

This application is to provide support for the Director of Oriel Science to exploit and build on the early, significant success of Oriel Science so that it will become an important regional exhibition space showcasing the wonders of science.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>108641</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/R001227/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
