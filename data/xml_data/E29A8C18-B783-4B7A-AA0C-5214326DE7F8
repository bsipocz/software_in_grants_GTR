One example is triangulations of surfaces. If we divide a surface, say a sphere or a donut, into triangular regions, then the geometry of the surface (which is potentially complicated) can be understood in terms of which triangular regions are incident to each other (and this is much simpler).

Combinatorial objects also occur in the context of generating objects of categories such as strong exceptional sequences or tilting objects, crepant resolutions of singularities, and vanishing cycles of Lefschetz fibrations. Recently, it has been observed that these combinatorial objects have remarkably similar properties which are independent from the branch of mathematics in which the were developed. On one hand, they can be constructed by finding maximal cliques of subobjects that satisfy certain compatibility relations. On the other hand, once one has obtained such a combinatorial object, it is possible to generate more by a process that swaps one of its subobjects for another one.

We use mutation as a generic term for these processes which go by different names in different branches of mathematics: Flops, Fomin-Zelevinsky mutations, twists etc. In the case of triangulations of surfaces, we have a particularly simple description: If we remove the border between two neighbouring triangular regions, then we create a quadrangular region, and there is a unique alternative border (linking the two other corners) which divide it into two new triangular regions. This is the fundamental instance of mutation.

Clearly, these observations suggest that there must be an underlying mathematical theory that ties all this neatly together, and the purpose of the workshop is to bring together researchers to discuss these questions.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The planned workshop will have significant impact both on academia and on public life in general.

In academia the workshop will lead to relevant research output of the highest calibre. The subject of the workshop bridges disciplines both within mathematics, but also between mathematics and physics. We expect this
to lead to synergetic effects. The various perspectives and approaches to related research problems will stimulate each other and eventually lead to mathematical or physical insight which will manifest itself in research outputs.

Moreover, the list of world renowned speakers at the workshop will bolster Britain's reputation for world-leading research. At the present time, leading scientists from Britain, Canada, France, Japan, Sweden, and the USA have indicated their interest to participate in the workshop. All these scientists will return to their home institutions with the confirmed impression of Britain's excellence in research.

As explained in the Case for Support, an important aspect of the workshop is the participation and training of postgraduate students. Postgraduate students will have the opportunity to get to know and experience internationally leading scientists. They will be exposed to the latest research trends and obtain a comprehensive overview of an exciting research area. In the training of postgraduate students, events like this workshop fulfill a key function: It is a great motivation to experience the leaders of one's own research area first hand.

Beyond academia, the workshop will be an important manifestation of cultural life. It will be conducive to research informed teaching which will eventually lead to better teaching in general, even at Britain's schools. The workshop will provide vital experience to postgraduate students, even if they choose to leave academia upon completion of their degree. Finally, the workshop will take place at a civic university in the North-East of England and hence strengthen the local identity.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-03-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>15912</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Pure Mathematics has a long time horizon. Fermat's work on finite fields took place in the 17th century, but the first application to cryptography did not occur until the RSA cryptosystem was published in 1977.

While the Workshop on Triangulations and Mutations had a big academic impact, we cannot say yet that there is an impact on wider society. However, we fully expect such an impact to happen in due course.</gtr:description><gtr:id>FFE806D5-04DF-42D0-A4F8-9B3F33E1294D</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>5638c5d3278277.64110742</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The EPSRC grant supported the &amp;quot;Workshop on Triangulations and Mutations&amp;quot; which took place in Newcastle 18-22 March 2013 with 52 delegates. The first day of the workshop also served as the Northern Regional Meeting of the London Mathematical Society and was funded with &amp;pound;7,500 by that organisation. The afternoon of the first day had colloquium style talks, accessible to a more general audience.



The key theme of the workshop was the interaction of combinatorics and deeper, more fundamental mathematical theories, in particular the prospect for combinatorics to be used as a handle to facilitate concrete computations. 



Some examples mentioned in the original application were tilting objects and mutation, as well as crepant resolutions of singularities. They lend a strong combinatorial flavour to topics of representation theory and geometry; in particular, they relate to the theory of triangulations of surfaces which are pivotal to recent developments in both areas.



The key gain made in the workshop was to bring together a diverse group of researchers, all of whom work in this area, and allow them to interact for a week. A number of new trends emerged in the talks and generated a high level of interest in the audience, and we will single out two.



(1) New categorifications of cluster algebras (Baur, Br&amp;uuml;stle, King, Leclerc). It has been well understood for at while how cluster algebras are categorified by the cluster categories defined by Buan, Marsh, Reineke, Reiten, and Todorov, but it is also clear that this categorification suffers from some shortcomings as explained by Nakajima. 

The talk by Bernard Leclerc linked to efforts by Hernandez and Leclerc, and independently by Nakajima, to define abelian categories which categorify cluster algebras in an alternative way.



The talks by Baur and King dealt with new Frobenius categories which categorify the coordinate rings of Grassmannians.



The talk by Br&amp;uuml;stle was on cluster algebras and cluster categories defined by triangulations of surfaces. It was particularly interesting that the themes of Frobenius categories and infinite clusters occurred in several talks.

2016 update: Triangulations of surfaces with infinitely many marked points on the boundary have a range of new applications to cluster theory. Holm and Jorgensen showed that they give rise to new classes of SL_2-tilings, and Grabowski and Gratz investigated some new classes of cluster algebras with infinite cluster arising from surfaces. Bessenrodt, Holm, and Jorgensen have announced a result that such triangulation give rise to *all* SL_2-tilings.

(2) Links with geometry (Felikson, Iyama, Smith, Sutherland, Tumarkin, Wemyss). A number of talks had such links as their major theme.



Felikson and Tumarkin spoke on different aspects of a joint project which, very surprisingly, goes from cluster algebras through representations of Coxeter groups and culminates in the construction of hyperbolic manifolds of minimal volume.



Iyama and Wemyss likewise spoke on different aspects of their ongoing research project which aims to understand minimal models in algebraic geometry by using non-commutative crepant resolutions. Such resolutions are intimately linked to clusters because they also permit a theory of mutations.

2016 update: New joint work by Iyama, Kalck, Wemyss and Yang apply rational singularities to obtain a plethora of Iwanaga-Gorenstein rings of finite Gorenstein Projective Representation Type. This is a very surprising source of such examples, but a welcome breakthrough which significantly extend the landscape of examples.

Smith and Sutherland both spoke on stability conditions, which are important invariants of triangulated categories. They showed how in some settings the space of stability conditions can be identified with a space of quadratic differentials on a Riemann surface. This correspondence links intimately with the &amp;quot;triangulations&amp;quot; theme of the workshop: The trajectories of the quadratic differential give a triangulation of the surface, which provides a quiver and a potential that can be used to construct the heart of the stability condition.

February 2016 update: There has been significant progress on the computation of stability manifolds, not least in the case of discrete derived categories treated in two big papers by Broomhead, Pauksztello, and Ploog. It is clear by now that stability manifolds are extremely complicated objects. The development of new methods for their computation is the subject of a host of ongoing research.</gtr:description><gtr:id>EA63AE00-2801-4966-8CFF-1D217F3D0ADF</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-7248294770.017547780bef4</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/K003720/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>27F853CB-FB22-4B9D-82D7-542648D097F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Algebra &amp; Geometry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9A30FDC6-AEB7-447C-A30E-0EF6BDB406FB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Logic &amp; Combinatorics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ABA2EC9F-6524-443A-BB92-7DF199FE4B25</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical Physics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
