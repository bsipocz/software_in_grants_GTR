In addition, as a New Investigator Award, this proposal will support a vibrant research environment by enabling young promising researchers, such as myself, to establish independent research careers here in the UK.

The results of this research will be communicated in peer reviewed publications. In addition, results will be presented at scientific meetings to communicate progress with the scientific community. Close interaction with the communications department of Imperial College and the MRC will ensure that new findings and porgress are dissseminated to the public in an appropriate and timely fashion.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>This proposal aims to investigate why, and how, inflammation becomes chronic leading to disease where the body?s immune system plays a destructive role. We hypothesise that the transition from acute to chronic inflammation is regulated by a signalling pathway involving the enzyme IkB Kinase (IKK) alpha. Because dendritic cells (DCs) play an important role in bridging innate and adaptive immunity, these studies will investigate the role of IKKalpha in DC function and antigen-driven chronic inflammation. We have recently discovered a new role for IKKalpha in limiting acute inflammation, published in Nature earlier this year. Previous studies show an important role for IKKalpha in the organization of the spleen marginal zone and germinal centre reaction in response to antigen challenge, illustrating the important role for IKKalpha in adaptive immunity. Therefore, our recent studies suggest IKKalpha has evolved opposing, but possibly complementary, roles in acute inflammation and adaptive immunity. IKKalpha functions to limit acute inflammation, by antagonising the ?canonical? NF-kappaB pathway, while promoting the development of adaptive immunity through the ?alternative? NF-kappaB pathway. Although innate immunity is classically considered to prime the adaptive response, acute inflammation must be switched off to avoid tissue injury while maintaining the development of adaptive immunity. Considering the unique role for DCs in ?bridging? innate and adaptive immunity, cross-talk between the ?alternative? and ?canonical? NF-kappaB pathways in DCs may regulate the transition from acute inflammation to antigen-specific immune responses that drive chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Ultimately, inhibition of IKKalpha may represent a new therapeutic target to prevent autoimmune disease while maintaining innate immunity. This proposal aims to investigate the hypothesis that IKKalpha acts as a molecular ?switch? to limit the acute inflammatory response and promote the development of adaptive immunity and therefore, plays an important role in the development of antigen-driven chronic inflammation. We will characterise the role of IKKalpha in activation of mouse bone marrow DCs derived from transgenic mice that express an inactive IKKalpha using biochemical techniques. This will be complemented with functional assays of antigen presentation and priming of T cell responses. These studies will be extended to human primary DCs where we will modulate IKKalpha activation with recombinant adenoviral vectors, using established methods. In vivo studies will evaluate the role of IKKa the role of IKKalpha in DC-priming of T cell responses and the development of antigen-driven chronic inflammation, using a mouse model of arthritis.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>323943</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">G0501176</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>C6D70A71-8796-47BC-AFE0-CC2286E66A06</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Inflammatory and Immune System</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
