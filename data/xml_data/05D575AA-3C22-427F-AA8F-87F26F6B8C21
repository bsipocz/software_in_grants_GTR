In order to perform their appropriate function proteins, which are composed of a linear chain of amino acids, must fold up into the correct three-dimensional structure in the correct place within the cell, or be targeted for destruction when damaged. To achieve this a set of proteins have evolved, known as molecular chaperones, whose function is essentially one of protein quality control, ensuring proteins fold correctly or are unfolded and targeted for degradation. One particularly acute problem is when the cell is exposed to harsh environmental conditions, such as heat, cold or chemical insult. This causes proteins to misfold and self-associate to form insoluble aggregates. These aggregates can cause cell-death and in some cases disease e.g. CJD, Alzheimer's disease. The protein to be studied in this project, ClpB, is a bacterial ATP-driven motor protein (part of the so-called AAA ATPase family) which is able to rescue proteins which have previously aggregated, thus helping the cell to recover. It adopts a ring structure and rescues proteins by translocating them through its central pore in a process dependent on the energy provided by ATP turnover. The mechanism is also analogous to that seen in similar AAA ATPase proteins which are involved in a diverse set of cellular functions. The aims of the proposed work is to investigate exactly how the energy derived from ATP is coupled to protein translocation through the ClpB protein complex. This involves measuring the nucleotide binding and hydrolysis characteristics in the two ATP binding sites on each polypeptide and evaluating how these two sites communicate with each other. The kinetics of the structural changes in the protein induced by the binding and hydrolysis of ATP, as well as those of the protein substrate being translocated will determined and compared. We are also going to examine the aggregation and amyloidogenesis processes at the level of single molecules (or single particles) to determine exactly which aggregates can be dissolved by molecular chaperones, and exactly how this is achieved.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The molecular chaperone ClpB is part of a bi-chaperone system which, along with DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE (KJE), has the unique ability to rescue proteins from an aggregated state. It is also a member of the AAA+ protein superfamily whose members are ATPases involved in a diverse set of cellular processes. Like members of that family, ClpB has two nucleotide binding sites and assembles into a hexameric ring with a pore running through the centre of the complex. It also has a unique coiled-coil domain, which lies between the two nucleotide binding domains, and protrudes laterally from the ring. Disaggregation is achieved as the DnaK system disrupts a protein substrate from the aggregate and then transferred it to ClpB where it is translocated through the central pore in an ATP-dependent manner before it can refold to its native state. Although the basic details of this mechanism are known there is, as yet, no quantitative, kinetic or structural description of how ClpB couples the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to protein translocation through its central pore. The work proposed here aims to elucidate the mechanism of this molecular motor by (a) determing the kinetics of ATP-induced conformational changes in ClpB and how they are coupled to binding, translocation and disaggregation of polypeptide substrates; (b) using single-molecule fluorescence burst analysis spectroscopy to examine the heterogeneity of the aggregation process, both for amorphous aggregates and amyloid fibrils, and determine which sub-population can be reversed by either KJE or KJE and ClpB ; (c) determining the precise nature of the interaction between DnaK and ClpB. This will be achieved principally using a variety of fluorescence techniques, (e.g. intensity and FRET) in both ensemble and single-molecule experiments.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-08-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-08-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>304185</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>ClpB is a member of a family of protein machines known as AAA+-ATPases, which use the energy derived from the hydrolysis of ATP to either disassemble or remodel other molecular complexes. ClpB has six subunits arranged in a ring structure with each subunit having the ability to bind and hydrolyse two ATP molecules. It is therefore a challenge to understand how the twelve ATP molecules are coordinated to allow ClpB to perform its task of disaggregating previously aggregated proteins in conjunction with the Hsp70 chaperone system (DnaK, DnaJ, GrpE). The work in this grant has identified the following key features of this system:
(1) The six ATP molecules at the top of the ClpB ring bind relatively weakly, are responsible for stabilising the ring structure, but also can hydrolyse ATP freely by themselves.
(2) The binding of six ATP molecules to the lower sites within the ClpB ring act to inhibit ATP hydrolysis by the top six and coordinate the motor function of the whole molecule.
(3) Mutational knock-out of the top ATP sites has only a proportional effect on the ability of ClpB to disaggregate aggregated proteins.
(4) Mutation of just two of the bottom ATP sites totally abolishes ClpB function, demonstrating that the importance of the motor action driven by the bottom six ATPs and also the nature of the coupling between those ATPs, which seems to suggest that the six subunits behave as three dimers that each act together.
(5) The unique M-domain undergoes large movements during the ATPase cycle and suggests that the base of this domain is the site of allosteric coupling between the two rings of ATP binding sites within ClpB. It is also the site of interaction with the DnaK chaperone that acts at the initial stages of disaggregation and so provides a method by which ClpB becomes activated when presented with a protein substrate.

Together our data have allowed us to construct a quantitative model of the ATP-driven functional cycle of ClpB.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>While the findings are mainly of academic interest, the AAA+-ATPases are common to many important intracellular processes and so an understanding of the common features of these machines will help us understand exactly how they function in each case. There are some clinical conditions associated with some of them, such as with mammalian p97, and so anything that furthers our understanding of how these molecular machines function may help in the development of therapies. In addition, chaperones that disaggregate proteins may also be useful in the production of aggregation-prone recombinant proteins in biotechnology.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>7DEED68D-942A-46D5-AFBE-391BE0183D76</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d6d6003fe2f0.30597730</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>DDFDD8C5-D700-42CE-ADD2-49BE8A14E468</gtr:id><gtr:title>Mapping the road to recovery: the ClpB/Hsp104 molecular chaperone.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of structural biology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/26693aca8f33a2ff46a83c356f81bfcb"><gtr:id>26693aca8f33a2ff46a83c356f81bfcb</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hodson S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1047-8477</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>544654a261b2e8.75124185</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/G01468X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
