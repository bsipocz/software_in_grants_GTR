Why this happens remains unclear. In recent years evidence has suggested that white blood cells (called monocytes) can crawl along the inner lining of blood vessels within the body's organs. It is believed that by doing this, the monocytes are well placed to kill any bacteria that get into the bloodstream, and to set in train reactions that prepare the body to clear the infection. However the way in which monocytes interact with cells lining blood vessels (called endothelial cells) remains unknown, and much of the available information comes from experiments in mice.

I have spent several months trying to develop an experimental system that places human monocytes in direct contact with endothelial cells from human blood vessels. I have shown that if bacterial material is present, the monocytes change their characteristics. This proposal seeks to extend this observation by working out how monocytes change when the endothelial cells are &amp;quot;activated&amp;quot; during an infection. I hope that understanding this system better may lead to a better understanding of severe infection and ultimately to better treatments. 

My hypothesis is that under normal conditions, an infection is &amp;quot;sensed&amp;quot; by the endothelial cells, which programme monocytes to become better at killing bacteria. However, when the infection is very severe, this system can be overwhelmed, and paradoxically monocytes can lose the capacity to clear infection. 

To test this idea, I shall firstly use my lab endothelial cell-monocyte system to check whether the cells have to be physically in contact to allow monocytes to change their characteristics. My reading of the literature suggests a putative chemical &amp;quot;switch&amp;quot;(called CSF-1) in endothelial cells, that may regulate the behaviour of monocytes. I can test this using techniques that increase or decrease the activity of the gene for CSF-1 in endothelial cells. 

I shall also test the ability of monocytes to kill bacteria when they are in the presence of &amp;quot;activated&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;unactivated&amp;quot; endothelial cells. I anticipate that killing of bacteria will be greater by monocytes on &amp;quot;activated&amp;quot; endothelial cells. This will provide an early indication of whether we can manipulate human monocytes to kill bacteria more efficiently. 

Importantly, the laboratory experiments described will give me skills that will allow me to study monocytes in humans. I shall do this in two ways. Firstly, our lab group has a system in which a very small amount of bacterial product is injected into the bloodstream of healthy human volunteers under controlled conditions in an intensive care unit. This allows a unique opportunity for me to obtain blood before and after the injection, and to study the characteristics and function of the monocytes using techniques available in the lab. 

Secondly, I shall study patients in an intensive care unit who have severe infection. I shall obtain small blood samples and again study the characteristics and function of monocytes. I shall compare the monocytes from patients with severe infection (a) with monocytes taken from the same patients after their recovery, and (b) with monocytes taken from patients in the intensive care unit who do not have severe infection.

The proposed studies will build on my preliminary work to date, they will provide new information in an important clinical area that might inform insights leading to new treatments, and it will give me an excellent foundation for a career in academic clinical medicine.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Mortality from sepsis remains high, there is a need to improve understanding of the basic mechanisms and identify novel therapeutic targets. Recent murine data suggest monocytes patrol endothelium and may regulate the immune response. However little is known about how monocyte subsets interact with endothelium and how this regulates innate immunity. 

Monocytes are classified according to surface markers into classical (CD14++CD16-), non-classical (CD14+CD16++) and intermediate (CD14++CD16+). Colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) may drive monocyte differentiation to the non-classical. These subsets seem to differ in function with non-classical involved in tissue repair and classical important for bacterial killing and the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-10. My preliminary data show that co-culture of human monocytes with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated human microvascular endothelial cells leads to an increase in classical monocytes. 

I hypothesise an appropriate host response to endotoxaemia is for activated endothelium to enrich the classical subset, stimulating bacterial phagocytosis and transiently increasing anti-inflammatory cytokines to promote tissue repair. However, in sepsis these mechanisms are overwhelmed leading to a prolonged immunosuppressive state. 

Using my established co-culture system I shall determine if the increase in classical is contact-dependent, determine the role of CSF1 and assess the capacity of these monocytes to kill clinical strains of bacteria. 

I will assess monocyte function in vivo. Firstly, by studying monocytes before and after the administration of intravenous LPS to healthy volunteers under controlled conditions in an intensive care unit. Secondly, by isolating monocytes from patients with sepsis and then again in recovery. 

This will provide novel insights into the functional consequences of human monocyte-endothelial interactions and may suggest future therapeutic manipulations.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The study seeks to generate high quality, reproducible protocols for the co-culture of primary human monocytes and primary human microvascular endothelial cells, and assessment of monocyte subset enumeration and function in this context. This is expected to accelerate research into monocyte subset/endothelial interaction, and to promote consistent methodology in different labs, which is currently lacking. These technical considerations will be of benefit to the scientific community. 

The study has a moderate to high likelihood of identifying putative therapeutic targets for further study by pharma or the academic sector. Given that sepsis affects tens of thousands of patients in the UK every year, and given the mortality associated with sepsis, identification of any novel cellular targets clearly implicated in pathogenesis may have far-reaching impact. 

The clinical studies will add to the small but growing body of evidence pertaining to monocyte subsets in infective illness.

The iv LPS model will provide novel temporal information about monocyte subsets in response to an acute infection-related stimulus. An important impact of the study will be the generation of data to inform end-points in future studies. This may be particularly relevant to pharma in providing opportunities to test the efficacy of novel drugs in a mild, controlled setting rather than making the first assessment of drugs in the complex and heterogeneous setting of critically ill patients.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>126807</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/P019935/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>C6D70A71-8796-47BC-AFE0-CC2286E66A06</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Inflammatory and Immune System</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>CF950C9A-DB16-4E23-8AEB-94548777BCA1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>1.1  Normal biological development and functioning</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
