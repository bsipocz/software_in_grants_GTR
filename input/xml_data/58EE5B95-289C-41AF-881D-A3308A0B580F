Developing such an algorithm is a particular concern for practitioners who use auralisation as a consultation tool in acoustic design of built spaces. In this process the data from the simulation model is rendered as sound by a loudspeaker system allowing a client or stakeholder, who is unlikely to be an expert in acoustics, to form a judgement on whether the acoustic design fits their needs. This process is of course only valid if the acoustic model delivers accurate prediction of how sound behaves in the space, and current commercial software does not always succeed in this task because the high-frequency geometric propagation assumption on which it is based breaks down at low frequencies and in spaces where diffraction effects are significant. Although alternate numerical methods exist they are typically limited to modelling only low frequencies since their computational cost becomes impractical as frequency or time-resolution is increased. In response to these shortcomings, this project will develop a new hybrid method which combines the best features of geometric methods and fully numerical boundary element method (BEM) solvers to provide a scheme that inherits desirable characteristics from both approaches; i.e. fully error controllable schemes, more accurate than geometric methods for low to mid range frequencies, but with reduced computational cost at higher frequencies compared to standard BEM, all achieved within a single unified framework. Such a model would potentially include all wave terms, geometric and diffracted, but lower energy reflections would only be included where necessary to achieve a given accuracy criterion (e.g. an SPL threshold or a function of the ear's perceptible difference limen) hence computational efficiency would be maximised.

Introducing an element of interactivity to the auralisation process, where a user would be able to explore the space and/or make dynamic changes to the sources and building geometry or materials, would be desirable from a consultation-productivity perspective but place extremely high demands on the acoustic model. Not only must the model dynamically update to reflect the modifications made by the user, but the requirement for accuracy is even more pressing since any feature the client chooses to introduce must be accurately rendered, even if it has a strong acoustic effect (e.g. concave focussing surfaces, room resonances, unusual echo patterns), and there will be little or no opportunity for an expert to check that the sound is realistic. The new algorithm we propose will address these needs since, as well as having improved accuracy, it also has the desirable characteristic that only a small easily identified subset of the acoustic interaction data needs to be re-computed when a change in building geometry or source location occurs; incorporating support for modelling time variant and interactive scenarios would hence be relatively straightforward. Towards this goal the project will also develop a new auralisation orientated audio platform which will represent acoustic interactions by a network of digital filters and output sound direct to audio hardware, and the simulation algorithm will be geared towards outputting reduced acoustic models in this format. Pilot studies will investigate how interactivity might be supported, as dynamic modifications of scenario objects and corresponding filter network elements, and how standard lumped parameter sound insulation and stochastic reverberation models may be incorporated. The project will conclude with a work package dedicated to modelling some real-world scenarios which would cause difficulties for current acoustic modelling software.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project has been specifically designed to address a knowledge gap in acoustic simulation. In particular we believe that this is limiting the impact of auralisation technology as a consultation tool to aid design of urban environments, so the project contains features specifically targeted at this application. Such tools are typically used to support improvements in acoustics to grant better quality of life (e.g. less intrusive background noise, more intelligible speech) hence this project also has ambition of significant societal and economic impact.

Using auralisation technology for planning consultation improves information delivery and informs choice, engaging stakeholders and enabling them to understand and evaluate changes planned in their communities, thereby minimising decisions which would have negative effects. This research therefore aligns directly with the Sustainable Society sub-theme of the Digital Economy theme, and will benefit both the general public and the public and commercial sectors, who will get a tool which can test public opinion to acoustic concerns in a direct way. In the short term acoustic consultancy firms will benefit by having an improved tool both for engaging, informing and selling concepts to clients and for providing accurate predictions so that designs may be refined in advance. This latter point also benefits the clients and end users of the spaces since it allows superior acoustic specifications, or similar specifications at a cheaper cost or with more sustainable methods and materials, and reduces the chances of poor designs being realised. These new technologies will almost certainly first be applied to high value projects where acoustics or noise are of particular concern, hence the immediate groups to gain these benefits will likely be users and patrons of arts and music facilities or stakeholders in planning situations where noise may be a problem (e.g. the use of Arup's SoundLab to gather evidence on noise attitudes regarding the planned High Speed 2 rail link). As the use of auralisation technology becomes more commonplace these benefits will spread to other areas, for example: schools (where poor acoustics has been shown to harm learning); hospitals (creating a more tranquil environment for recovery); urban cityscapes and transport interchanges; and homes and dwellings. In the longer term it has the potential to be a disruptive technology in urban and rural planning and is expected to drive increased consideration of &amp;quot;soundscape&amp;quot; concepts in these applications.

Much of the impact above is also education of non-specialists to consider and better understand their acoustic environment. As such the project outcomes will also offer new opportunities in public engagement into the understanding of science, acoustics, and human perception of sound.

With the increasing use of spatial audio in gaming, tele-collaboration and broadcast there is a demand for tools which assist sound designers in the realistic placement of sources within a 3D virtual environment. This project will directly inform such tools and the involvement of the BBC through the Audio Research Partnership at Salford will help steer the project towards impactful outcomes in this area and permit further work to re-package the new algorithms for use by broadcast professionals. Beneficiaries will be the UK broadcast and gaming industries and the end users of their products.

Although the project is focused on acoustics, the wave propagation model and computational framework developed in this project will also apply to other wave phenomena, notably electromagnetics. Dissemination into this academic field will influence the telecoms and defence industries in particular, which in turn have wide societal/economic impact through improved communications and national security.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>249719</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>BBC Research &amp; Development</gtr:department><gtr:description>Arup - auralisation</gtr:description><gtr:id>1971AB64-DDAF-4BA7-9CC0-C2F73EEE46FF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Development of a wave matching based high frequency acoustic modelling method.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dd3dc3abda03.26736266-2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Guiding the project towards industrial relevance and realistic applications.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Informing partners of the latest developments in acoustic modelling and auralisation, which contributes to the partners' future research and development plans.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Arup Group</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Acoustic Consulting</gtr:department><gtr:description>Arup - auralisation</gtr:description><gtr:id>E953ACF3-7BCD-4580-AF72-7462D3A88AD8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Development of a wave matching based high frequency acoustic modelling method.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dd3dc3abda03.26736266-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Guiding the project towards industrial relevance and realistic applications.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Informing partners of the latest developments in acoustic modelling and auralisation, which contributes to the partners' future research and development plans.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited research talk (MHiVec workshop in Freising)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C7C2C8B7-A193-45F0-9294-4E9D95F239CD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>To disseminate research outcomes on high frequency acoustics modelling to the vehicle industry.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d01589377915.15474877</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.mathematicsntu.org/MHiVecWorkshop/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Professional magazine article acoustic simulation and auralisation as built environment design consultation tools (IoA Acoustics Bulletin))</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3FF4A8DD-2F4E-45FE-95AA-47629F365968</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Describes an EPSRC-funded workshop on on numerical acoustic simulation and auralisation as built environment design consultation tools, which was co-hosted by Arup and the University of Salford.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d01944a512e8.44619644</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://usir.salford.ac.uk/36887/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Nottingham Trent University seminar (Acoustic modelling: methods, challenges and applications)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3D11D618-EC10-4FF9-8329-BA1F347E7EC1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Talk sparked questions and discussion afterwards

Both theoretical and practical issues were considered, with a key goal being to promote better mutual understanding, identify directions for future development, and open up possibilities for future collaborations. This was achieved via showcasing recent developments, through both presentations and practical demonstrations. The workshop concluded with an open discussion on how research might be progressed so that these goals were met. Plans were discussed for seeking funding to organise further such networking events (in a survey afterwards 100% of respondents said they had found the industry / academia networking aspect of the workshop beneficial, and that they would like to see more such events in future) and to coordinate joint publication and benchmarking initiatives, the latter being aligned to complement the parallel work being done by the European Acoustics Association technical committee for computational acoustics and the SEACEN project in Germany.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d0141b996ac7.73780207</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://hub.salford.ac.uk/acoustics/workshopSept2015/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Research talk (Durham University)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DEB9B7C5-4529-4EE0-95AA-A98D6DD9F03E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>To present and discuss advances in the Partition of Unity high frequency BEM modelling.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d01664c75631.33737270</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Organised a structured session at Forum Acusticum &quot;Emerging Computational Room Acoustic Methods&quot; (Krakow)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3E693BA1-38FC-4D16-9198-1086BEC8DD0A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A structured session in an international conference to disseminate to and engage with researchers on emerging computational room acoustic methods, with the objectives to stimulate ideas and future research directions.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d017ffbc2306.10033167</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://usir.salford.ac.uk/33051/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Southampton University seminar (A common acoustic energy flow metric for spatial audio and the boundary element method)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C9328531-6E2B-4AEB-954B-CC2DE6A65838</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Talk sparked questions and discussion afterwards.

A new high frequency BEM method based on the idea of wave matching has been developed, and code was written to apply the method to realistic applications. Specifically, it has investigated methods to extend the highest frequencies that can be simulated using the Boundary Element Method (BEM), and in doing so has produced new insight into parallels with existing methods based on a geometric approximation of acoustic propagation. The Hybrid-Numerical-Asymptotic BEM formulation developed at the University of Reading has been extended to allow simulation of an obstacle (a planar screen) in 3D. The problematic numerical conditioning of the closely related Partition-Of-Unity BEM has been investigated and a variant with much improved conditioning and sparse interaction matrices has been developed. A new algorithm which combines the best of these approaches by selecting wave directions adaptively is developed. While the accuracy and efficiency of the method still need to be developed further, the potential of the method was demonstrated in the auralisation of the acoustics of a small room in the final dissemination workshop of the project. An integral transform enabling more efficient evaluation of the (otherwise extremely costly) integrals arising from these schemes in 3D has been published including a Matlab? demonstrator toolbox. This development is not only essential for the efficient application of the proposed wave matching method, but also can also be applied to other high frequency methods employing the partition of unity approach. Finally a new approach for mapping the results of numerical models onto a 3D spatial audio reproduction format (specifically Near-Field-Compensated Ambisonics) has been published; this also unifies a number of microphone array design techniques.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The dissemination of the findings of this project is still in progress. However it is anticipated that the knowledge and tools we have developed will ultimately lead to a new generation of full-bandwidth acoustic prediction algorithms, which will be more reliable that the current crop in applications where diffraction and other effects not captured be purely geometric models are significant. The dissemination workshops at the end of the project have generated significant interests in both the research community and industrial sectors. To this end, we are developing proposals for further research and networking activities to encourage increased adoption and impact. Further work in developing the methods and in particular the development of benchmark cases for high frequency methods has been discussed with potential academic and industrial partners. A collaborative proposal to the EU is being planned.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>91D3DD08-59A7-4AC3-96BE-F5464C59222C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dd39d93f9af9.72279221</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Construction,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://hub.salford.ac.uk/acoustics/category/projects/hybridbem/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>The software is provided without warrantee under a Creative Commons 'Attribution' licence (CC BY); see http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ for more information.

The code contained herein is intended only for demonstration purposes and is deliberately structured to match the formulae given in the paper - it has not been optimised for fast execution.</gtr:description><gtr:id>C1A5BF2F-15EA-4075-BCAC-DCBBD4A7DC22</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This toolbox is used int he project to demonstrate efficient evaluation of oscillatory surface integrals arising in three-dimensional boundary element methods.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c2706f92fe55.53656475</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>A Matlab toolbox for efficient evaluation of oscillatory surface integrals.</gtr:title><gtr:type>Software</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1002/nme.5204/asset/supinfo/nme5204-sup-0001-Supplementary.zip?v=1&amp;s=767aa1e781bd9013c143d761381e7bb9c1be2956</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>891C6D4C-685E-4276-9F07-221F38BC422B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Acoustic cross-energy measures and their applications</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/866af855857ba7878b0d444c5271796f"><gtr:id>866af855857ba7878b0d444c5271796f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hargreaves JA</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56d01099355459.71062962</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D3F513B8-90C0-424A-8A80-2C5604ED5779</gtr:id><gtr:title>Towards a full-bandwidth numerical acoustic model</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7ada54d10d5b85eb0c6444c9cd24b4a7"><gtr:id>7ada54d10d5b85eb0c6444c9cd24b4a7</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hargreaves J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5461d504c2b648.35134797</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E647DAB2-C4E4-4664-8FA7-CE1E68A0D7F6</gtr:id><gtr:title>An Energy Interpretation of the Kirchhoff-Helmholtz Boundary Integral Equation and its Application to Sound Field Synthesis</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Acta Acustica united with Acustica</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7ada54d10d5b85eb0c6444c9cd24b4a7"><gtr:id>7ada54d10d5b85eb0c6444c9cd24b4a7</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hargreaves J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5461d1a5e9e2a1.66919658</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3FFB4C32-2964-45F8-9CB5-2DAE5B174517</gtr:id><gtr:title>A transformation approach for efficient evaluation of oscillatory surface integrals arising in three-dimensional boundary element methods</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7ada54d10d5b85eb0c6444c9cd24b4a7"><gtr:id>7ada54d10d5b85eb0c6444c9cd24b4a7</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hargreaves J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56d00f28a349e8.92936451</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3C9FD20D-7743-423D-AD9F-8641D0467A62</gtr:id><gtr:title>A high-frequency BEM for 3D acoustic scattering</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/866af855857ba7878b0d444c5271796f"><gtr:id>866af855857ba7878b0d444c5271796f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hargreaves JA</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56d0111aad4626.34535104</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>EEAABFD8-1A28-4052-9E3E-C5E8D5DE1A3E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Simulation of acoustic environments for binaural reproduction using a combination of geometrical acoustics and Boundary Element Method</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7ada54d10d5b85eb0c6444c9cd24b4a7"><gtr:id>7ada54d10d5b85eb0c6444c9cd24b4a7</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hargreaves J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5aa650a2a39197.75401249</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/J022071/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>772CD758-53CD-407F-9B2C-F2B861E86155</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mechanical Engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B148AA4C-48F9-4B18-90F6-641750F725A1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Acoustics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
