It involves measuring the walls in the property using a Laser device that enables fast and highly accurate measurement. Information is then sent electronically to a computer controlled off-site cutting machine that is rapid, precise and mess-free.
The key success of WHISCERS? is that residents stay in occupation during the work, which brings the cost down considerably. Off-site cutting of the insulation panels reduces the mess and time spent in the home and it is much safer; it also minimises dust and wasted insulation materials. As the board is cut off-site it is particularly suitable to metropolitan/urban sites or sites where compound space is at a premium.
The system has been installed in a few homes in London and we are now critically looking to scale up the installations to more and a wider variety of properties.
This bid seeks funding to further develop and monitor WHISCERS in a variety of properties, in particular to test it in varying construction types, as found in different European countries.
In summary
?Traditional IWI install c&amp;pound;110m2 excl survey costs, WHISCERS is c&amp;pound;88m2 inclusive of all costs
?Using Kooltherm K18 we can reduce the U Value from c1.9 to 0.3 in most cases of housing
?Traditional install time for 2 bed flat 5-6 days, WHISCERS 2-3 days
?Waste take back is c6% (recently measured) as opposed to c10% in traditional refurbishment
?Resident energy bills can be reduced by c30% if they follow on site guidance to correctly heat and use their homes post install
?Reduction in heat loss through walls of c40% are more than achievable
?Saves home loss payments which could be as much as &amp;pound;4000 per install for the housing provider
?Generates fewer complaints 95% satisfaction on most recent scheme
?Payback is circa 14 years or less on the basic calculation and zero if you add in savings on statutory payments to residents for home loss and disturbance etc
?Meets Target Zero aspiration strategy for Health and Safety
?Easy to train new installers
?Creates technical and manual jobs
?Suitable for re-skilling existing trades
?Would fit a training academy structure
?Contributes to local economy through the energy savings it potentially creates (mini Stern impact aspirations)
?Lends itself to creating a network of off site cutting facilities to reduce delivery road miles
?An opportunity to bring people into permanent employment
Improves poorly heated housing and therefore can increase residents health and life opportunities (we have a joint study with L B Camden about to start)
?Laser total station survey skills can be transferred to new into work trainees
?CAD drawings generate accurate install data
?Data transfer to CNC cutter is seamless and removes extra drawing issues/confusion etc
?Individual flats programmed for greater resident liaison
?Board cuts maximised on CNC cutter to maximise board usage/reduce waste
?Low waste all collected directly at the cutting factory
?Cut to suit site conditions/facilitates easy rapid install
?Up to 30% cost/time saving
?Safe, safe, safe</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>164409</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">620051</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
