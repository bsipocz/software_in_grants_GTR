We form the &amp;quot;rational&amp;quot; numbers as fractions of integers such as 2/3 and -3/5. Often the next step in looking at new numbers is to look at decimal fractions such as 2.17182818284590... . Whereas integers and rational numbers are part of algebra and exact mathematics, decimal fractions really come into the realm of approximate mathematics, since any given list of digits is only an approximation of the full infinite list of decimal digits. The study of such approximations is often called mathematical analysis. However there are other numbers such as the square root of 2 which lie beyond the rational numbers but can be understood with exact methods. These numbers are called algebraic numbers. Each is the solution to an equation such as x.x = 2, whose solutions are exactly the square roots of 2. Connecting the algebraic numbers with the decimal numbers and analytic methods is a surprisingly subtle and difficult task.

The twelfth of Hilbert's list of 23 mathematical problems from his famous lecture in 1900 asks roughly how certain families of these algebraic numbers can be captured by analytic methods. A little more precisely, it asks for an analytic method for computing the abelian numbers over any number field K. A suitable method was already known before Hilbert in the simplest case when K is the field of rational numbers. The next simplest cases are when K is just the rational numbers together with a solution to a quadratic equation. In some cases (the &amp;quot;imaginary&amp;quot; quadratics) a method was also known by Hilbert, but in the other cases (the &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; quadratics) there is still no known method, although some have been proposed.

In this project we will use the methods of mathematic logic, specifically model theory, to chart a new way between the algebraic and analytic methods which is &amp;quot;exact&amp;quot; but will allow some of the power of the analytic methods. We hope this new method will give new insights into Hilbert's problem, particularly relating to the real quadratic case.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project is in pure mathematics, and its most direct impact will be within pure mathematics, as explained in the section on Academic Beneficiaries and in the Case for Support. In this section we concentrate on the longer-term potential impact of this project and its subject area.

Two contrasting approaches to mathematics are those of algebra which involves exact computations, and analysis which involves approximations. The tools of analysis are most useful where exact methods are impossible, or where no exact methods are known. Elliptic curves can be studied in both ways, but it is the algebra (and algebraic number theory) of elliptic curves rather than their analytic guise as complex tori which has direct practical computational applications, for example in cryptography. In contrast, the so-called quantum tori are essentially analytic objects but Manin's real multiplication programme and this project seeks to show close connections between these quantum tori and elliptic curves. In this project the approach is through the exact method of model-theoretic algebra. A possible longer-term outcome of this project would be to find a new algebra which encompasses elliptic curves and these quantum tori. There would be great impact to coding and cryptography if they are as useful as elliptic curves. Taking a more general view, the project seeks to open up an area of mathematics to exact algebraic methods which could in principle be implemented on a computer, and hence have new applications outside of research mathematics.

One difficulty with modern mathematics is that different branches necessarily become very specialised and hard for anyone not working in that branch to understand. There can be a danger of isolated branches becoming separated from the rest of mathematics and from the world outside research mathematics. This project is one which will build and strengthen connections between different areas of mathematics at a deep level. Such projects ensure that mathematicians from different areas are involved in explaining their work to a broader mathematical audience, which in turn helps them understand how to explain it to an audience outside mathematics. Thus projects such as this which build connections inside mathematics do indirectly have an impact on the understanding and appreciation of mathematics in the wider population.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-02-23</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-02-24</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>99103</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The model theoretic property of quasiminimal excellence has been related to the j-function. This j-function classifies elliptic curves, which are used amongst other places in cryptography and also in number theory. The j-function is also related to understanding the arithmetic of the solutions of certain quadratic equations, namely those with only complex solutions. Quasiminimal excellence is a tameness property for the geometry of the function.

The quasiminimal excellence property has been obtained and explained for the more general setting of Shimura varieties, of interest in number theory. For the quasiminimal exponential function, it was shown that the rational field is not universally definable.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This area of research is now a hot topic, and many people are working in it.
