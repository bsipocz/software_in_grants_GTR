By contrast with these studies of biological factors that influence face preferences, this project will investigate whether social learning is also a potent source of individual differences in face preferences.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project will also investigate the range of circumstances under which social learning effects on face preferences occur. The project will use a paradigm developed by Jones et al. (2007, Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B) to investigate whether social learning effects on face preferences only occur for social transmission of mate preferences or also occur for social transmission of attitudes during same-sex interactions. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>Furthermore, the project will investigate whether viewers are more likely to copy the face preferences of physically attractive individuals generally or are more likely to copy the face preferences of individuals who are of similar attractiveness to themselves. These tests will offer insights into the mechanisms through which visual experience during social interactions shapes face preferences.&lt;br />&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>70264</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Observing social interactions influences attractiveness judgments of the actors involved. Perceptions of others' attractiveness was increased when other individuals appeared to respond positively to them (i.e., smiled at them). 

This effect was observed regardless of the type of interaction observed (same-sex or opposite-sex interaction) and was seen in both male and female participants.

The attractiveness of the person doing the smiling and the attractiveness of the participant interacted. People were more likely to copy the social preferences of people who were similar to them in attractiveness.

This extends our prior work showing social transmission of face preferences in humans (Jones et al. 2007 Proceedings B).

Additionally, we found that these effects were not caused by increased tendency to simply look where attractive individuals were looking or increased sensitivity to gaze cues in attractive individuals. 

Papers reporting these results were published in Proceedings B and Psychological Science.

A full list of the papers arising from this project is given in our publications list.

Additionally, two presentations reporting parts of these results were presented at the 2008 British Science Festival (Liverpool) and the 2009 British Science Festival (Guilford). A short interview with Dr Jones from the Liverpool festival about the research project was broadcast on BBC News 24.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2008</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>02753DEB-17E4-4B04-AA9E-7950A100A6F5</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545237f27c04e2.96649687</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Observing social interactions influences attractiveness judgments of the actors involved.
