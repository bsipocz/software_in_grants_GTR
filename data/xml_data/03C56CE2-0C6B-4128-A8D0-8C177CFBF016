But though the developmental dimension of virtue ethics is mentioned even by Aristotle - as he says, 'it is a matter of no little importance what sort of habits we form from the earliest age' - it remains underexplored to this day. This is a significant theoretical gap in its own right. Filling it promises to yield new understanding not only of the processes by which vice and virtue are formed, but also of what vice and virtue are, and thus to address afresh the fundamental issue in virtue ethics: the relationship of vice and virtue to the proper development of human nature. 
However, this theoretical gap is one which also threatens to have practical consequences. Vice and virtue have been a prominent theme in recent public policy discussions, with character education envisaged as a key means by which early years interventions can address social problems. But if we do not understand how virtues and vices of character are formed, we cannot intervene effectively to promote or prevent their formation. And if we do not understand how the traditional vices and virtues relate to those developmental goals which lie more obviously within the reach of early years interventions - like warm relations with caregivers, the ability to focus on a task, or the ability to defer gratification - we have no way of evaluating whether these interventions really are promoting virtue, or if so, how. 
The proposed interdisciplinary research network aims both to address the theoretical gap identified above, and to devise theoretical tools with which to assess character-building interventions in the early years.
It will do so by bringing moral philosophers working in virtue ethics together with experts in attachment theory, one of today's leading approaches in developmental psychology, which has been influential in public policy discussion on character but has yet to gain proper recognition from philosophers.
It is able to take on both tasks because the network's theoretical and policy-focused ambitions stitch together neatly.
According to attachment theory, attachment dispositions are the product of natural selection: clinging, following and so on evoke caregiving behaviour in adults, which favours survival. And individual attachment dispositions (secure or insecure) explain high-level psychological differences - e.g., in respect of the ability to co-operate or to regulate emotion. But are co-operativeness and emotion-regulation virtues - distinctively modern ones which deserve a place in philosophy alongside the Aristotelian and (post)-Christian catalogue? Or are they more basic dispositions which can underlie vice and virtue alike? Co-operativeness is socially useful, so if - as Philippa Foot maintained - the virtues are the traits necessary for us to lead our characteristic species life, the answer seems to be yes. But co-operation is as necessary for war and interest-rate fraud as it is for socially useful activity. The answer is thus decisive for the fundamental claim of neo-Aristotelian virtue ethics - that virtues and vices are natural excellences and defects. To evaluate that claim is the network's central theoretical goal. But co-operativeness and emotion-regulation are also typical goals of early years interventions: because of these traits' well-established links to secure attachment, if we can promote secure attachment (e.g. by teaching parenting skills), we know we can promote those traits. But are we thereby promoting virtue? If these traits are virtues, yes; if not, then either we are not promoting virtue, or we are doing so but do not yet properly understand why. Mapping the relationships between the traditional virtues and the high-level psychological traits attachment theory is in a position to explain is thus a path to fulfilling both the network's theoretical and its practical ambitions.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Non-academic beneficiaries will include:

- anyone concerned with the formulation and assessment of public policy designed to build character, including government (e.g. the Cabinet Office BIS); Members of Parliament (e.g. the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Social Mobility); non-government-funded researchers beyond academia (e.g. Character Counts, the Dartington Social Affairs Unit); the business sector interested in character building as a strategy for economic growth (see 'Characteristics that Last a Lifetime', in First Steps: A New Approach for Our Schools, CBI 2012); and the third sector (e.g. Sutton Trust).

- professional psychologists and psychotherapists concerned with the relationship between attachment-based interventions and the formation of vice and virtue, i.e. with the ethical dimensions of their own therapeutic goals.

- anyone liable to benefit from character-building interventions by the above, which includes parents, children themselves, and employers - e.g. the beneficiaries of Character Counts' EasyPeasy app for parents and 2-4 year-olds (initially funded by Guys &amp;amp; St Thomas's and The Design Council), now being evaluated for a possible national roll-out by Prof. Kathy Sylva at the Oxford University Department of Education.

All the above seek to apply notions of good and bad character in policy design, so all will benefit from the proposed network (i) because the network will build relationships between them and researchers at the cutting edge of research on character development both in philosophy and in developmental psychology; and (ii) because targeted intervention designed to build character depends for its effectiveness on clear concepts, in particular on the conceptual sharpening the network will make available of the relations between three different sets of characterological notions, viz. attachment classifications, the notions of good character current in pubic policy discourse on character building (e.g 'resilience'), and traditional virtues.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>39277</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop presentation, Centre for Global Studies, London</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DAC7D5FC-5414-4E6B-8EF2-713146496E0A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I presented a paper on some findings from the Network - specifically, on the relationship between classical conceptions of the virtues of character, and the concept of character as it features in contemporary public discourse about 'character building' - to an interdisciplinary audience of (mostly) academics and some policymakers/politicians</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c2f5b6e9d231.68429554</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop presentation, Dartington Social Affairs Unit</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>07509187-39B2-485C-8EEC-4AF988470140</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I attended a workshop organised by another member of the research team, Michael Little, on the role of emotions (especially shame and guilt) in targeted interventions focused on victims of multiple deprivation (e.g. how shame can prevent people from accessing services).

One has been through Core Group member Jen Lexmond, Director of Character Counts. Prior to the project, Jen developed a character-building smartphone app (EasyPeasy) aimed at parents and their pre-school children, which had a very small-scale initial trial on the basis of which (and her expertise on character and public policy) Jen was invited to join the Core group. A larger-scale roll-out of the app was evaluated during the project period in conjunction with the Oxford Education Dept., and the results presented at Conference 2 of the Network. This found that the app had a positive effect on child outcomes. However, how to interpret the nature of the positive effects - were they effects on character, or what? - was harder. The Network had some effect on the interpretation of these outcomes, and also served to affirm the value of the app, thereby (we hope) contributing to further roll-outs (and associated funding) in future.

The second pathway has been via Core Group member Michael Little of Dartington Social Affairs Unit, who advises local authorities on how best to spend their social welfare budgets. He has recently been arguing against targeted interventions on the grounds that in order to access them (e.g. an intervention designed to teach people to parent better) participants need to self-identify as bad parents. Since this carries a stigma, people are unlikely to do it, so targeted interventions do not reach the groups who most need them. More effective are population-wide interventions that raise the level of (e.g.) parenting even slightly in a population as a whole. Some character-building interventions are of this sort. The advice Little has been giving to local authorities over the last year has been influenced, in his view, by the findings of the Network on character-focused interventions - not only by the Network conferences but by presentations to his research group at Dartington by Harcourt (see Engagement Activities). We hope to continue this collaboration and document it more fully over the remainder of the award period.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>8A4885F3-F846-48DA-8F64-2E513C01A010</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>58c2fc3c4bf4a0.52248851</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/N004043/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>946C0541-464B-43A5-9EE3-65C23360E959</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Philosophy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>24C2FD61-D899-497D-8F52-D8C590EAD745</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Child Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9A6079E0-357B-44DA-80F9-C5953586BD0C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Developmental psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E24DFBD1-65CA-4C0A-ABA6-58F8F129200B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ethics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
