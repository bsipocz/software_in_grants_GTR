With the widespread explosion in the use of mobile technologies and the adoption of social media applications across all social demographics and age groups, online low level fraud and abuse levels have increased dramatically. Banks, on-line retailers, Service Providers and Application developers provide a multitude of protection and support mechanisms of varying degrees of robustness and operative ease to customers and users within their own respective communities.
To bring sense to this varied and uncoordinated protection landscape and to enhance users' experience by simplifying design and proposition, the Mobile Data Association proposes a technology framework and systematic process that will provide a simple, single national standard reporting interface (and associated services) for all online service providers.
Such a multi-operating system interface will allow all users (regardless of technical know-how or challenging conditions) to report financial scams, fraud, online bullying and trolling. A single reporting point mechanism provides a faster, simple to use, consistent and more effective way of reporting fraud, which will lead to greater uptake, greater success in identifying and prosecuting offenders and greater confidence in mCommerce and social networking. Once implemented it is anticipated that consumer pull will drive demand for the facility from any reluctant providers, thus mitigating against 'consumer confidence' being a reason for consumers not to embrace mCommerce from said providers. This interface will provide more meaningful and accurate data about fraud volumes and will demonstrate to those perpetrating fraud that the complexity of reporting such crime has gone. With the associated back-end infrastructure, the likelihood of meaningful investigation (particularly when patterns emerging from the data point to a mass fraud) will be increased as will the likelihood of perpetrator apprehension - all expected to directly lead to an overall reduction in fraud attempts which will further feed consumer confidence in mCommerce.
The Mobile Data Association (MDA) - a not-for-profit trade association founded in 1994 - through its wide network of contacts, has already gathered core information required by banks, regulators and prosecution services and has defined an initial application programming interface (API) for discussion and working prototype development. To complete the design, engage with all interested parties and develop a prototype reporting gateway, the MDA requires funding. Once completed, the MDA intends to release an API under a free license for all developers such that they can integrate the single reporting point mechanism into both new and existing services.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>48000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">971333</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
