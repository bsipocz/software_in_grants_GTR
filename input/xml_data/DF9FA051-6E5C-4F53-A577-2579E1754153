Our immune system is regulated in a such a way as to tolerate these commensal bacteria, while remaining poised to rapidly respond to any harmful pathogenic bacteria that try to invade through our intestine. It is not clear how the immune system is able to discriminate between good and bad bacteria in our guts, but the importance of maintaining this balance is illustrated by the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), chronic debilitating disorders of the intestine caused by inappropriate activation of immune response against commensal bacteria. IBD encompass Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), which together affect around 1 in 500 people in the UK and currently there is no cure. IBD patients are also at increased risk of developing bowel cancer. Treatment involves long term administration of immune suppressive drugs to reduce the symptoms of disease, but these often have harmful side effects and are not always effective. A better understanding of how the immune system malfunctions in the intestine during IBD is necessary in order to develop new and improved therapies.

Genetic studies in IBD patients have indicated that altered versions of genes involved in bacterial recognition and control are associated with an increased risk of IBD. Several genetic changes that predispose to IBD are in genes associated with autophagy, a cellular survival response that is induced by stress or starvation. However, recent studies have shown that autophagy proteins are also involved in immune defense against bacterial infection.
The aim of this study is to use mouse models of IBD to to investigate the role of autophagy proteins in controlling inflammation in the intestine. The second key objective is to better understand the immune functions of autophagy proteins in different types of cells in the intestine. Many intestinal bacteria do not directly interact with the white blood cells of the immune system, but instead have important effects on the epithelial cells that line the surface of the intestine. In turn, the epithelial cells can influence the behaviour of the host immune cells. Therefore, we aim to use genetically-modified mice that lack certain autophagy genes either in the intestinal epithelial cells or in the host immune cells.

These experiments will help us define how autophagy proteins contribute to the control of inflammatory responses in the intestine and to the interactions between host cells and intestinal bacteria. We also hope to identify the intestinal cells in which autophagy proteins mediate their effects, as well as the pathways involved. The knowledge gleaned may lead to novel therapies for patients with IBD, especially for those who carry altered versions of autophagy genes.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The aim of this project is to define the roles of autophagy proteins in the regulation of immune and inflammatory responses in the intestine. In particular, we aim to assess the functions of autophagy proteins in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) and in leukocytes during homeostasis in the intestine and during conditions of acute or chronic inflammation. This will be achieved by generating transgenic mice in which the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) associated autophagy gene Atg16l1 is ablated in specific cell types (IEC or myeloid cells) through tissue-specific expression of the Cre recombinase. These conditional Atg16l1 knock-out mice will be assessed in models of bacterially-triggered intestinal inflammation that reproduce many aspects of the inflammatory pathology associated with human IBD. The impact of ablation of autophagy proteins in distinct cell types on the induction and regulation of IBD pathology will be assessed, as well as their effects on bacterial handling and immune defense in the gut. Factors and pathways that are identified in the mouse IBD models to be regulated by Atg16l1 will be verified by analyses of cell and tissue samples from IBD patients. A better understanding of the roles of autophagy proteins in intestinal homeostasis may lead to the development of novel therapies for IBD, particularly in patients who harbour mutations in autophagy genes.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The primary results of this laboratory-based basic research will be disseminated through publication in leading research journals as soon as possible after completion. Ongoing research progress will be disseminated through regular presentation at lectures, seminars and at conferences and meetings in the UK and abroad. All resulting publications will be linked to the lab website which is publicly accessible and regularly updated.

Academic beneficiaries in the field of mucosal immunology will include other researchers in the UK and abroad who are working on the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We envisage that our findings may have a significant impact not only in the field of mucosal immunology, but also on additional disciplines in areas of immunology, chronic inflammation and microbiology. The links between autophagy proteins and inflammation are relevant not only in IBD, but also in other chronic inflammatory disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, as there is growing evidence of shared pathological mechanisms. Therefore, the results of our project may stimulate a wider assessment of the role of autophagy proteins in other diseases. In addition, a better understanding of the role of autophagy proteins in distinct cell types could help uncover new strategies to stimulate immune defence pathways in the intestine, which is relevant for designing vaccines against mucosal diseases.

Eventually, the results of this basic research may impact clinical practice in IBD. Identification of the pathways that link autophagy proteins to intestinal physiology could lead gastroenterologists to investigate new avenues for therapy and to better patient outcomes as new therapies are selectively applied to appropriate patient sub-groups. In turn, these improvements in clinical practice should provide significant financial benefits to local health authorities through a more economical employment of resources. For example, the improved knowledge could help avoid unnecessary use of expensive drugs as well as decreased hospitalization of patients.

The results of this research may also have potential benefits for the pharmaceutical industry. A better understanding of how autophagy proteins function in different cells in the gut should identify new targets for drug design and may stimulate the development of new approaches needed to direct drugs to specific host cell types.

The ultimate potential beneficiaries of this basic research are IBD patients. The chronic, debilitating nature of this disease, as well as the side effects associated with most of the long-term conventional immune suppressive therapies, emphasises the need for new and better treatments that can significantly improve patient health and quality of life. The identification of new targets for biological therapies and effective translation into clinical practice is illustrated by the recent success of TNF blockers, which are now widely employed in IBD patients. However, the high proportion of patients who do not respond, or who become refractory to TNF blockers, illustrates the heterogeneity of these disorders and then need for targeting novel therapies to the patient groups who are likely to derive most benefit. A better understanding of autophagy proteins in the gut may facilitate the development of novel 'personalized medicine' approaches for selected subsets of IBD patients.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-01-08</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-09</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>392699</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>1878290</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Wellcome Trust New Investigator Award</gtr:description><gtr:end>2020-08-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Wellcome Trust</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>102972/Z/13/Z</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>C2254951-F4CF-4B86-955C-0987F67BD4E9</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54638e092e4571.16789970</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-09-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>We have established a recently described technique that allows the long-term culture and propagation of primary intestinal epithelial cells (IEC).</gtr:description><gtr:id>4C9BC92D-F1F0-46AC-B2BB-4EFE0C248630</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This technique allows us to grow primary IEC as tissue 'organoids' that can be propagated in vitro, akin to long-term cell lines.
