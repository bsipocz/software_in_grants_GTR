At the end of the reaction, extra operations (known as 'work up') are required to separate the product from byproducts and any remaining starting materials. Work up/separation procedures can be complicated and time-consuming, and can constitute 40-70% of the costs of chemical processes. It also consumes extra resources (energy, material, additional solvent), which is detrimental to the environment.

One way of overcoming the separation issue is to conduct multiphase reactions, where the starting material and the reagent are dissolved in immiscible solvents (such as oil and water). After the reaction, the products remain physically separated from the reagent and byproducts, which simplifies the workup procedure. However, there are several fundamental issues that need to be addresse; namely, how fast reactions can occur at the interface, and how to control it precisely to afford reproducible and predictable outcomes (which is very important for its eventual application in industry).

The proposed programme will develop a new type of continuous manufacturing process for multiphase oxidations. First, it will use electrochemistry to generate inorganic oxidants in water from non-hazardous inorganic salts and electricity. The solution of oxidant will be mixed with reactants in an immiscible solvent, using a specially designed reactor that generates an emulsion from the two immiscible fluids. After the reaction, the two different phases then separate out naturally, thus simplifying the workup procedure. 

The research programme will focus on the generation of different oxidants and their intrinsic reactivity. We will also develop novel emulsion forming systems to handle liquid/liquid reactive flows. The rates of the various steps in the process will be deteremined, to produce a predictive model that we can be used to construct a mini-plant for demonstration purposes.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-04-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-04-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>324536</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>ACHEMA Innovation Hall 9.2 stand E83</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1B8F30B8-3D9B-4785-A97C-3E8BB42DA09D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>ACHEMA is the world forum for chemical engineering and the process industry innovations platform and technology summit. We shared an exhibition stand with our EPSRC project collaborators, Imperial College, and were one of only three UK universities exhibiting in the Innovation Hall. We took demonstration equipment for both the oxidation (Imperial) and the membrane emulsification (Loughborough) technologies, and explained how they integrated together. We had well over 200 industrial delegates visit our stand and express an interest in our developing technology. Discussions with a number of these visitors are ongoing, and will be helpful for developing the technology further, to ensure maximum impact.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56bcb3a28e7b06.53190071</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.achema.de/en/home.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>I now have several collaborations, and potential collaborations, on biphasic systems with mass transfer and with reaction.

This enables continuous production of a material by: drop generation; reaction and mass transfer; separation of reaction products; and recycle of unreacted material for further reaction to take place. This has been applied, in the context of this grant, to oxidations of organic phases where the oxidant is in the aqueous phase. The unstable emulsion formed provides a means by which the drop size can be controlled to be small enough to provide high reaction surface area and, therefore, reaction rate whilst at the same time being large enough to facilitate the separation and recycle of the product and unreacted species. Control of drop size is critically important for the appropriate balance between these two conflicting requirements, and membrane emulsification provides the means by which this can be achieved.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Continuous processing based on liquid-liquid phase systems is commonly encountered in mass transfer and reaction engineering operations. We are currently investigating additional systems that have this at their core, e.g. complex coacervate production of encapsulated particulates, fluorine solvent based systems (with minimal solvent presence undergoing recycle), and similar biphasic systems. Thus, we are using the technique as an enabling technology that can be easily scaled-up to process capacity for a number of continuous processing requirements.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D4A62EF9-ECC3-4DC0-A827-8CD5361BBF2F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56bcb79dd78677.92682740</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C705177B-7329-4774-B0D8-216860A4AD97</gtr:id><gtr:title>Controlled multiphase oxidations for continuous manufacturing of fine chemicals</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Chemical Engineering Journal</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b81143df1cba3269ea9753894ef334b3"><gtr:id>b81143df1cba3269ea9753894ef334b3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Loponov K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c010c59ad8d2.57380030</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/L011697/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64596636-AE88-4F6E-A816-9C4C203E1197</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>70</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Catalysis &amp; surfaces</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>99E0B904-CAB5-4511-AFB3-AA6D2B171F97</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Process engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E0D6615C-86EB-4FB1-9874-BFED2EE238B4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>70</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Electrochemical Science &amp; Eng.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8AD167A0-777B-4F91-B5B9-F13843B235F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Separation processes</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
