We will do this by looking at our ability to switch between different tasks. Specifically, we will compare how difficult it is to switch away from a task that we have either: a) only prepared to perform (we &amp;quot;knew&amp;quot; what the relevant task was but we didn't &amp;quot;do&amp;quot; it), or ii) actually performed (we both &amp;quot;knew&amp;quot; it and &amp;quot;did&amp;quot; it). 

In our everyday lives we frequently need to switch between the different rules that guide our behaviour. For instance, when driving a car we might switch rapidly between the following &amp;quot;tasks&amp;quot;: visually assessing potential hazards at a junction; accelerating past a tractor; performing an emergency stop. From studies using laboratory tasks, we know that switching tasks usually leads to slowed responses, and that we occasionally even repeat the previous task in error. The existence of this &amp;quot;switch cost&amp;quot; reveals that some aspect of the previous task must persist in some way to affect the speed or accuracy of our subsequent behaviour, even though we know that it is no longer relevant. In this project, we wish to find out about what causes this cost of switching between tasks. 

Our main question concerns whether just preparing a task (&amp;quot;knowing&amp;quot;) will have different consequences from actually performing it (&amp;quot;doing&amp;quot;). There are various examples in psychology of situations where what we know has surprisingly little impact upon what we do. For instance, we can sometimes verbally repeat instructions given to us, and demonstrate that we understand and remember them, but then fail to implement them at all (a phenomenon known as &amp;quot;goal neglect&amp;quot;). A similar distinction has been drawn in task-switching research. It had been thought that doing a task would produce a subsequent switch cost, but that knowing which task should be performed without actually carrying it out would produce no subsequent cost. However, more recent evidence using a different method suggests that merely preparing a task can in fact produce a substantial switch cost, even if the prepared task was not performed. 

We will conduct a series of psychological experiments in which people perform two different tasks. For instance, we will show them coloured shapes (like a blue circle) and ask them to press a button to indicate either what the colour is or what the shape is. By intermixing the two tasks randomly, we will be able to assess people's ability to switch between tasks, relative to repeating tasks - that is, we can measure each person's switch cost. On most trials, people will prepare a task and then perform it: for instance, they may see the word &amp;quot;colour&amp;quot; and then a blue circle, at which point they press the appropriate button to indicate that the colour is blue. Crucially, however, on some trials we will require a task to be prepared but not performed: e.g., we may show the word &amp;quot;colour&amp;quot; but then no coloured shape, instead moving straight on to the next trial. Therefore, we will be able to measure the switch cost that follows preparation separately from the switch cost that follows performance. Across a series of experiments we aim to find out what causes these types of switch cost to be established and abolished, and in what ways the switch cost driven by preparation may differ from that driven by performance.

The cost of switching tasks indicates a fundamental limitation in our cognitive system that is relevant to many situations (e.g., working in a busy office, driving in heavy traffic, preparing dinner while taking care of a baby). Understanding the mechanisms behind this limitation is of potential practical importance with respect to reducing risks associated with this cost. The present project will meet this challenge by illuminating the origin of this limitation.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The massive flexibility of human cognition gives us the ability to respond in various different ways according to our goals and to the situation. When our goals change or the situation changes, we must change our behaviour. This is the essence of task-switching, and it is something we do innumerable times a day as we juggle competing demands from one moment to the next. Even within what may appear to be a single task, such as driving, we may actually need to rapidly and accurately switch between very different types of behaviour: e.g., visually assessing hazards in or near the road, accelerating past slow vehicles, and braking in an emergency. It is easy to see how slow or inaccurate switching could result in very real problems and therefore it is important to understand what causes the cost of task-switching and how we might aim to reduce it.

While there has been a good deal of research into our ability to switch tasks in the last couple of decades, one aspect has been studied relatively little so far, although it occurs frequently in our everyday lives: that is, the impact of preparing to do a task, but not actually doing it, upon our subsequent behaviour. The issue here is that we do not always carry out our intentions. While driving, for instance, we may consider overtaking a tractor and even get as far as intending to do so, before changing our minds. In this project, we will investigate what kind of effect upon our subsequent performance is produced by preparing an intention to carry out a task even when the prepared task is not actually performed.

There are strong parallels between this work and ideas in other areas of cognitive psychology, especially those involving the distinction between &amp;quot;knowing&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;doing&amp;quot;. Therefore, the results we obtain should be very relevant to academic researchers across a range of fields - including the use of instructions, prospective memory and goal neglect - as well as more directly within task-switching and cognitive control. 

More widely, this type of basic cognitive psychology research forms a fundamental basis for other types of research. Our project will both establish the role played by preparation versus performance factors during task-switching and involve the design of behavioural paradigms well-suited to the differential measurement of these factors. This may be very useful knowledge for researchers who seek to understand, for instance, the precise nature of task-switching processes in clinical or developmental conditions, or who require a way of measuring this type of cognitive function (e.g. over time as a disorder progresses, or following the instigation of treatment). In parallel, these outcomes will potentially be of benefit to cognitive neuroscience (e.g. fMRI) researchers looking to discover the brain processes underlying cognitive control, since these may differ depending on whether the switched-from task was performed or only prepared. 
 
Finally, our work may also be relevant to those seeking to apply basic science to real-world issues, such as assessing the impact of multitasking in the workplace, and to the designers of &amp;quot;multi-use&amp;quot; equipment such as computer hardware and software, where features of stimuli and responses (e.g. the dual-use letter-number keypad) are used across different tasks.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>333572</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/R005613/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E457FFDE-A4C1-4907-AE12-A394D95A3AE5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cognitive Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E1AC33C6-9927-41AC-B23B-2EED8F593588</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Experimental Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
