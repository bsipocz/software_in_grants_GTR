&lt;p>&lt;strong>Colourimetry&lt;/strong> ? Where the children will use colourimerty methods to analyse water samples&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Biogas production&lt;/strong> ? where the children will be able to investigate how gas is generated from farm wastes&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Elements of soil science&lt;/strong> ? a hands-on approach to soil science, soil types and textures and the importance of soil biota.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Water pollution&lt;/strong> ? Hands-on demonstration of how phosphorus moves to watercourses, why it is important and how we measure it.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In addition ?Gary the Musical Clown? will be premiering his new show based on Key Stage 2 ?Living things? on the first three days of the event. This show has been developed alongside scientists from IGER, and will be taken out to schools in the future.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1500</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The evaluation process tells us that we have got things just about right in the format and content of this event.

Primary school children are offered few opportunities to experience science at a level which they can understand. We therefore believe there is particular educational value in targeting this age group and the event is much appreciated by teachers. The Science fair has been held annually (funded under this scheme) since 1995 (except 2001 due to foot and mouth disease). During the Monday to Friday of SET week schools are invited to the site where there a number of ?hands-on? experiments/activities for them. The event is targeted at KS2 (Year 6) pupils, although some of the smaller schools bring all their children, and this is taken into account when developing the workshops. Experience has told us that we have a very successful format where the children are split into groups on arrival, the groups then spend 20 minutes at each workshop before moving on to the next, and then finishing with a drink and a biscuit. This year we had the added attraction of ?Gary the Clown? (www.garytheclown.co.uk) presenting his new show on KS2 ?Living things? developed in conjunction with IGER. This was a big hit with the children and introduced them to the requirements for plant growth and development and is closely linked to the national curriculum. 520 children plus about 50 teachers and adult helpers from 16 primary schools attended the event</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In order to evaluate the event the BBSRC evaluation forms were used. A number of teachers were given the ?Teachers form? and groups of children were given the ?Primary form?.
Teachers returned 10 forms and 90 were returned by children.

? Teachers thought that ?taking part in activities? was the most important, ?obtaining information? and ?meeting scientists? were equally important, ?being entertained? was of lower importance.
? Children thought that ?being entertained? was most important, came second ?taking part in activities? and ?meeting scientists? and ?obtaining information? were of lower importance.
? 100% of teachers thought that the content was ?enjoyable?, 70% of children thought that the content was ?enjoyable? and 30% thought it was ?OK?. 
? All teachers and children thought the event was ?relevant?.
? 100% of the teachers thought the organisation was ?good? as did 76% of the children, the remainder thought the organisation was ?OK?.
? 90% of teachers thought that the demonstrations were pitched at the correct level.
? All teachers thought that the event was ?interesting/enjoyable?.
? All teachers asked to be invited back next year.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>2F907BAE-21D7-4FA4-AC25-8EFA127F979A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545cd548b4ff74.70900461</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">RES-168-26-0093</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-168-26-0093</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
