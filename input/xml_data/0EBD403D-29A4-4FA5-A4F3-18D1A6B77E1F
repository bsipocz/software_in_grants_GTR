Contemporary France</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Fellowship</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/L003937/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>'Mapping Memories of Slavery' explores how commemorative associations located in France and its overseas departments are challenging the state's failure to engage with the history of slavery. It begins with the 150-year anniversary of the abolition of slavery (1998) that was celebrated in France under Chirac's presidency (1995-2007) and gave rise to the passing of a landmark law (Taubira Law, 21 May 2001). After decades of silence, this law retrospectively recognized slavery as 'a crime against humanity' and committed the Republic to overcoming its former refusal to confront this difficult past. In reality, however, little has since been done at a national level to honour this legal pledge beyond the most perfunctory commemorative 'duties' performed each year by the state on 10 May (2006-). In the absence of a genuine effort to address the history of slavery and incorporate it into the nation's narrative, numerous commemorative associations have, since 1998, emerged across the French Republic. Their projects, which range from political campaigns to re-baptise streets named after former slavers to the reconstruction of a pedagogical slave ship, collectively aim to valorise the identities of those descended from slavery. The desire to create visible and, at times, violent sites of memory in which the voices of these descendants can be heard has much to say about the construction of postcolonial identities and memories in France today. In the absence of a state memory, the study of the relationship of these commemorative associations to the past therefore exposes the changing role of the nation-state as an increasingly nebulous point of reference for identity formation.
This project has two primary aims. First, it seeks to assess the efficacy of the state's commemorative practices from the perspective of those most affected by this history. Primarily, it will examine the extent to which the government has achieved its legal intention to offer moral reparations to the descendants of slaves by ensuring that the memories of slavery, the slave trade and its abolition become embedded within the national narrative. Second, it aims to explore the ways in which commemorative associations have encountered and countered state-led memorial practices with models of remembrance that often challenge the Republic's celebrated motto: 'Libert&amp;eacute;, Egalit&amp;eacute;, Fraternit&amp;eacute;'. Indeed, these are projects that remind us that the racism, inequality and social division of contemporary society remain some of the most divisive legacies of the colonial past.
As the first complete study of memory and identity formation among commemorative associations, this project will work with twelve citizen groups based in Paris, the former slave ports of Nantes and Bordeaux, and the former plantation colonies of R&amp;eacute;union, Martinique and Guadeloupe. Drawing its primary data from archival work in government and museum centres, complemented with key stakeholder interviews with association members, artists, local politicians and government committees, it will compare the planning and execution of state- and association-led commemorative events from different perspectives. In addition, it will gather the responses of local and national media, and the wider community, to these occasions. Through these sources, it will present an in-depth picture of the divergence of opinion that exists between the contemporary French state and its citizens over the remembrance of slavery and the slave trade. In doing so, will reveal the complex and dynamic ways in which identities and memories are being formed in a society with an increasingly weak sense of Republicanism. These discrete case studies thus serve as the basis for offering a new theoretical model for understanding postcolonial identity formations within and beyond the nation-state and the increasingly fragile relationships between the French state and its citizens as they attempt to work through the legacies of the past.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>'Mapping Memories of Slavery' is geared towards making a significant contribution to the tenth anniversary of slavery commemoration in France in 2016. By working alongside commemorative associations and government bodies located throughout the French Republic, it will not only produce excellent research for academics, but will necessarily target the non-academic communities with which it is involved. Since it explores some of the deep-seated issues affecting marginalized communities today, including social integration and belonging, cultural memory and patrimony, and the diversity of Republican identities, it will be of potential interest to a large number of non-academic groups. 
The first major group concerns the public sector for which a bilingual report will be compiled (see 'Research Outputs' for more details). The government-funded Committee for the Memory and History of Slavery, which is responsible for overseeing slavery commemoration at a national level, has already expressed a strong interest in reading the results of this report. Following a conference on memories of slavery organized by the PI in 2011, collaborative links have been established with the president of the Committee, Fran&amp;ccedil;oise Verg&amp;egrave;s, who acted as keynote speaker and is in regular contact with the PI. In addition, regional offices dedicated to the preservation of local patrimony and culture, and located in regions formerly involved in slavery and the slave trade will be interested in the findings of the project. The Archaeological and Patrimonial Authority in Nantes, for example, would like to consider the responses of local associations to the city's commemorative efforts since this research contributes to their own projects on community responses, which have already been shared with the PI. The PI will seek to deepen these pre-existing relationships and reach towards other equivalent bodies located in Paris and the French Antilles, as well as museum sites that are concerned with communitand cultural memory. As such, the report summarizing the research findings may have a significant political impact since it will showcase successes and highlight areas for development in terms integrating marginalized memories through commemorative projects.
The second major group concerns commemorative associations. Initially, this will require building upon the links that have already been formed with three associations in Nantes and Bordeaux by including citizen groups based in Paris and the French Antilles. Through the creation of a website (where the report will also be publicised), these groups will be able to view the full range of commemorative practices happening across the French Republic and identify possible areas for future cross-regional collaborations. The website will do this by providing biographical and analytical information connecting different citizen groups. In future, the site may be expanded to include associations based throughout the French- and English-speaking worlds since it has the potential to generate a significant cultural impact by facilitating transnational connections between different commemorative associations. Funds to support the implementation of this bilingual website have been built in the FEC.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-20</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>60290</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences (EHESS)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>France, French Republic</gtr:country><gtr:description>Reparations for Slavery</gtr:description><gtr:id>9ABBE328-9F98-4CB4-BE4D-E06EF79065CB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Through our collaboration with CIRESC and BCU (who are listed as two of our key project partners), we have successfully been awarded a AHRC Research Networking Grant, entitled &amp;quot;Reparations for Slavery: From Theory to Praxis&amp;quot;.

On 26 and 27 October 2015 at St John's in Edinburgh, I worked in collaboration with the Africa in Motion (Aim) African Scotland Film Festival to screen two films relating to slavery and reparations: Karen Marks Mafundikwa's The Price of Memory (2014) and Tony Buba's Ghosts of Amistad (2013). The films were accompanied by a poster exhibition on the 'The Unrepaired Past' and a dance performance, entitled 'Traces of Time', performed by the Dutch-Surinamese professional choreographer, Farida Nabibaks.
 On 29 October 2015 in Glasgow, a third film was screened as part of the AiM film festival, and we organized and chaired a public debate on reparations for slavery in collaboration with the Coalition for Racial Equality and Rights (CRER) for Black History Month. The screening and debate were hosted in Glasgow, a city that was at the centre of the Scottish slave trade. Katrina Browne's film Traces of the Trade (2008) set the scene for the subsequent debate by focusing on the living consequences of one of the U.S.'s most shameful episodes - slavery. The panellists for the debate brought together political, academic and activist representatives from the UK. 
This strand was described by Africa in Motion as 'very timely and stimulated a great deal of discussion around the topic of the legacy of the slave trade and it's continued effects now. The events were very well attended and attracted just over 200 people in total (breakdown below).

Many of the people who attended this event are now part of the networking grant, which is due to start in May 2017.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c95474378960.16380575</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://conferences.hss.ed.ac.uk/reparations/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>4000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>LLC Impact Support Fund</gtr:description><gtr:end>2015-05-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>University of Edinburgh</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>2B889EAA-48C8-41FE-A5C6-E7F62BB25208</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c9505c7c0f24.44835769</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-05-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>3000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Knowledge Exchange and Impact Grant</gtr:description><gtr:end>2015-11-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>University of Edinburgh</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>182975EB-48A6-4B8A-A4F4-46209FE14AFF</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c950a7d48e24.41120155</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-11-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>45000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Research Networking Grant</gtr:description><gtr:end>2019-02-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council (AHRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>AH/P007074/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>30AB2BE5-27AF-428B-8FF6-7CD1C9D9DDA4</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c94f819ad0c3.51841587</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-05-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>1000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>LLC Impact Support Fund</gtr:description><gtr:end>2015-10-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>University of Edinburgh</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>EDA46A78-5C97-4301-B061-2F8B25AB55AF</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c95002312da4.14026583</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Following the launching of the project website (http://www.mmoe.llc.ed.ac.uk/fr) in 2015, which includes a map of all the activities and activism around memories of slavery across the French Republic (including its overseas departments) and a public report engaging directly with misunderstandings about reparations for slavery, a number of activists have been in contact with me, wishing to contribute to the project and/or collaborate. I have also received emails from people commenting on the usefulness of the report and the map as a tool for activists. Going forward, we will be relaunching an English-language version of the site and the report, both of which will be used as a pilot for a larger-scale project through which we will be documenting the history of reparations activism.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>0DC9BC3B-07B0-4F0F-AE12-833DCED2B1D0</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>58c95c579946b7.55250318</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The AHRC Leadership grant has enabled me to begin mapping a network of activists based in France and its overseas departments who are concerned by the effects of European-led slavery on contemporary society. I have developed close links to different activist groups and have conducted nearly fifty interviews with activist leaders that have explored issues such as social integration and exclusion, black identity, reparations for slavery, memories and trauma and French republicanism.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>A website will be constructed using funds from the grant. This website will prove useful for researchers, activists and advisory bodies working in the field of slavery studies and reparations for slavery. The report that will be written on my research activities will be submitted the French government's Committee for the History and Memory of Slavery in 2015, and may prove useful in shaping decisions in the future.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>7C91B408-4547-4AE2-8B13-95905F89267F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5463724b26eeb3.65380829</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>77CD0FB7-1FA2-4601-9824-92039C716FCF</gtr:id><gtr:title>At the Limits of Memory - Legacies of Slavery in the Francophone World</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/09598a9863a770c5a4677e694743c592"><gtr:id>09598a9863a770c5a4677e694743c592</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Frith N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781781381595</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>5462582d294689.66262119</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>472893A6-B221-4C13-97B2-86102627D4DE</gtr:id><gtr:title>Saving the Republic: State Nostalgia and Slavery Reparations in Media and Political Discourses</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Modern &amp; Contemporary France</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/09598a9863a770c5a4677e694743c592"><gtr:id>09598a9863a770c5a4677e694743c592</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Frith N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>588b716d83efe3.98767351</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7A7E0BE1-3A16-4E2B-B2B9-71DDFABB91C2</gtr:id><gtr:title>At the Limits of Memory: Legacies of Slavery in the Francophone World</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/09598a9863a770c5a4677e694743c592"><gtr:id>09598a9863a770c5a4677e694743c592</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Frith N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781781381595</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>54625881d04b70.27206748</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/L003937/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:parents><gtr:parent><gtr:id>0EBD403D-29A4-4FA5-A4F3-18D1A6B77E1F</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>AH/L003937/1</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>60290.32</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2014-01-20</gtr:start><gtr:end>2014-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:children><gtr:child rel="Transfer"><gtr:id>25C3051B-F073-4309-B965-1A65E7E36004</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>AH/L003937/2</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>16572.55</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2015-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2015-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:children/></gtr:child></gtr:children></gtr:parent></gtr:parents></gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1AE825FC-C165-4D0F-B712-D5FA662046AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>French Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9DFBE9F1-538E-4C96-B606-5163472E6960</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Literary &amp; Cultural Theory</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3CE20DB9-873E-489F-BBC7-3F05BD0D900C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EF860896-6A4B-4EF6-A42E-F78E49ED901F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Post-Colonial Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
