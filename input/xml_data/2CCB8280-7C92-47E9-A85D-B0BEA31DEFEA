Overall, average survival is around 1 year. Mesothelioma is a cancer of the lining of the lung. It is almost always caused by exposure to asbestos and currently there is no cure.|Our work is aimed at improving the results of treatment in lung cancer and mesothelioma in terms of patient survival and quality of life. We currently have 1 open trial (QUARTZ) and 3 (LU22, MS01 and INCH) that are closed to recruitment and we are now looking at the results.|When lung cancer spreads to the brain, the length of time that patients live and their quality of life is modest and extremely variable. Currently the standard therapy is a combination of steroids and whole brain radiotherapy. However, whole brain radiotherapy causes side effects and there is no good evidence to show improvement in quality or length of survival. Therefore QUARTZ has been designed to assess whether steroids plus the best possible care are as effective as steroids, best possible care and whole brain radiotherapy.|LU22 looked at patients with operable non-small cell lung cancer to see if survival can be improved by giving chemotherapy before surgery. The main results in 2007. The results of similar trials are now being compared by the MRC CTU meta-analysis group.|The MS01 trial assessed the value of chemotherapy for patients with mesothelioma. The main results were published in 2008 and a quality of life analysis is underway.|For patients with locally advanced inoperable non-small cell lung cancer, the standard treatment is radical radiotherapy. The CHART schedule (giving small doses of radiotherapy 3 times a day over 12 consecutive days) has been shown to give a better survival than conventional once daily radiotherapy. The INCH trial aimed to see whether the results of CHART could be improved by giving a course of chemotherapy before CHART. The trial closed due to poor accrual because few centres in the Uk couold offer the accelerated radiotherapy</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Lung cancer is by far the commonest cancer in the Western world, with around 35,000 new cases per year in the UK. Prognosis and treatment depend on the histological type, and the extent to which it has spread when first diagnosed. Overall, median survival is around 1 year from presentation. |Our programme is aimed at improving the results of treatment in lung cancer and establishing the best standard treatment in mesothelioma in terms of duration of survival and the quality of life. We currently have 1 open trial (QUARTZ), and 3 (LU22, MS01 and INCH) that have closed to accrual, main results have been published and further analyses are ongoing. |About a third of all patients with non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) develop brain metastases, and once this happens median survival is around 2 months. Many of these patients will receive whole brain radiotherapy, but this has side-effects and has never been shown to extend survival or improve quality of life. The QUARTZ trial addresses this issue, and patients, all of whom will receive supportive care with dexamethasone, are randomised to either receive whole brain radiotherapy or not. The primary outcome is Quality Adjusted Life Years so as to combine duration and quality of life. We are aiming to accrue around 500 patients to this challenging trial, and the results will potentially have a major impact worldwide.|In patients with surgically resectable NSCLC, our aims are to see if we can improve survival by giving pre-operative chemotherapy. LU22 closed in July 2005 with 519 patients, the largest trial of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer. The main results were presented in the Lancet in 2007. The data is currently contributing to an MRC CTU led individual patient meta-analysis on this subject. |The MS01 trial investigated the value of chemotherapy for patients with mesothelioma. It opened in 2001, following a feasibility study to see if patients would accept a randomisation to supportive care alone. The trial closed in July 2006 with 409 patients, making it the second ever largest trial in this disease. The results were published in the Lancet in June 2008, and a further paper, looking at quality of life is underway. |INCH evaluated CHART radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy, the trial closed early due to poor accrual due to the few number of centres in the UK that were able to offer CHART.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>173000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MC_UU_12023/8</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>7C58A707-1BF6-4573-A44F-30B271C80813</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cancer</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>7135039D-2DB0-4D41-87B3-FA1C8D38E133</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>6.1  Pharmaceuticals</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>6FFAED28-939F-4795-9FD1-98511549B3B8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>6.5  Radiotherapy</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
