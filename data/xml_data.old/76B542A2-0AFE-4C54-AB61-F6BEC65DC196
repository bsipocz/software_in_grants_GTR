Many uncertainties remain in the likely conditions the world will experience, for example in local rainfall, and the effects of such changes on agriculture, fisheries, health and industrial development. It is today's early career researchers who will be tasked with tackling these challenges in future. To generate the skilled people necessary, we propose an international PhD partnering between the University of Cape Town (UCT) and the University of East Anglia (UEA) in the areas of (1) understanding the climate system, including the ocean and atmosphere, and (2) developing capacity to cope with a changing climate. 

The proposed partnership will exchange PhD students in the fields of climate science (e.g. climate modelling, ocean science, atmospheric science), climate impacts (e.g. social science, international development, human health, agriculture, fisheries) and adaptation strategies. UEA and UCT are two universities with strong expertise in these disciplines. These strong and complementary centres and academics are brought here together in a formal arrangement for the first time. 

The PhD researchers will benefit from strong expertise in both UEA and UCT in a range of key and modern methods. They will learn the skills needed to fully develop as researchers and operate in a global research environment in their field. Our partnership includes world experts in the measurements of ocean currents, marine biogeochemistry and ecology, fisheries survey, and atmospheric trace gases, as well as experts in conducting fieldwork on climate change adaptation and on epidemiology. We also have expertise in the synthesis and analysis of global datasets such as the global temperature (CRUTEM) and global ocean CO2 (SOCAT), and expertise in the modelling of physical climate, biogeochemistry, and integrated assessments of impacts and adaptation options. Importantly, many of our academic staff are experienced in working in interdisciplinary teams, a skill that is becoming increasingly important to address issues related to climate change using the best possible solution. 

The exchange of 10 PhD students on each side will take place ideally in annual cohorts of 3-4 students, with an initial cohort of UEA students going to South Africa around February 2016, and an annual cohort of South African students coming to UEA around September. Students will be paired with someone of similar interests on both sides. This arrangement will create a support group for the students both for helping to quickly integrate socially and professionally and to be productive in advancing their knowledge, skills and connections quickly. Furthermore, at least three members of academic staff from each of UEA and UCT will also take part in the exchange, one each year. Additional exchanges are envisaged from projects that are already on going. 

The group will benefit from international visibility through their integration with the Tyndall Centre at UEA and the African Climate and Development Initiative at UCT, contacts with the staff developing the international Future Earth platform, and connections with staff members that play key roles in international efforts, such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the World Research Programme.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed UCT-UEA PhD student exchange partnership builds on existing interactions to work together to promote the economic development and welfare of South Africa and the surrounding nations. The exchanges will up-skill local early career scientists in the area of climate science and how to cope with climate change while enhancing livelihoods. At the same time it will build understanding amongst UK early-career scientists of climate change issues in South Africa, providing a foundation for their longer term engagement with South African researchers.

The main impact of the proposed partnership will benefit those managing sustainable development in Africa (local governments, aid agencies, leaders of industries such as agriculture and fishing). This is through better understanding of likely climate change and its effects on water supply, agriculture and food security, human health, fisheries and marine ecosystems, the uncertainties in such projections, and the techniques for mitigation, adaptation and alleviation. 

This impact will be achieved through holding open workshops in South Africa to undertake knowledge exchange with local decision makers, and through ensuring that webinars and dissemination events are open and widely advertised.

The exchange will produce cohorts of PhD students trained in the advanced subject-specific and transferable skills necessary to address the issues of climate change in South Africa, and the wider developing world; these will benefit future employers. The project will build capacity in the use of new environmental observing systems, climate-relevant data analysis and modelling, adapting and finding solutions to a changing environment. The resulting trained cohorts of PhD students with experience of working overseas at the partner institution, linked to industry, will be better connected with international activities such as Future Earth and IPCC, leading to enhanced reach of research and enhanced capacity to operate in global research environment.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-11-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-11-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>152438</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Cape Town</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>South Africa, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>UCT-UEA Newton PhD partnership on Understanding the Climate System and Coping with Climate Change</gtr:description><gtr:id>33DA7107-18C8-49F3-8085-803BD5A9EE6D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This collaboration is new and thus we do not yet have outcomes.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56def71e9be6e7.38507074-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>UCT is expected to host the first cohort of PhD from UEA during Autumn 2016.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The University of East Anglia (UEA) and the University of Cape Town, South Africa (UCT) are starting a new partnership scheme supporting PhD students conducting research in the areas of 'improving understanding of the climate system - including the ocean and atmosphere' and 'developing capacity to cope with climate change'.

These are: 
(1) a Global Challenge Research Fund on Growing research capability to meet the challenges faced by developing countries. Our large proposal in preparation (&amp;pound;8mi, 5 years) looks at responses to climate change in urban environment and tries to identify the economic benefits of low carbon development. It links the UEA School of International Development with the UCT African Climate &amp;amp; Development Initiative (ACDI) and the UCT African Centre for Cities. Our linkages strongly build on interactions between the UEA Tyndall Centre and UCT ACDI in the past year through this Newton Partnership. 
(2) a large-scale NERC project on the 'OCEANic release of Greenhouse gASes under Pressure from multiple stressors (OCEAN-GASP)' that will conduct field work in the Benguela region off the coast of South Africa. UCT's Marcello Vichi has agreed to be project partner and to help guide both the field and modelling work and to link with corresponding research at UCT. This further links UEA's School of Environmental Sciences, Centre for Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences (COAS) with UCT's School of Oceanography.
Furthermore, we have been able to link additional researchers through opportunities that have arisen through the UEA and UCT connections with Future Earth. Through our partnership information was diffused more widely on international opportunities (e.g. for authorship of the important IPCC assessment reports and workshops). 

The programme so far has achieved the objectives of the Newton partnering call, it has facilitated active communication between UEA and UCT. It has helped in the development of communication between researchers in the two locations, such that we are confident that open communication will continue. The programme has set the groundwork for ongoing collaboration on climate research work.

The partnership has developed sustainable, strategic links between UEA and UCT in two key areas:

At an individual student level it has improved understanding of the climate system on seasonal time scales through research on ocean processes. The exchange of PhD students between countries has allowed for field work, development of new models, and acquisition of new data and knowledge which will help to constrain climate variability and its drivers, including aspects of the global ocean carbon cycle. Students have had the opportunity to engage with new research programmes, for example in the case of Kulthoum Omari the UEA-led annual release of the Global Carbon Budget. (http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/).

The programme has helped in developing understanding of the options to deal with climate change through identifying and quantifying climate change risks, and the potential for implementing impact and adaptation options. Three partnering activities have been undertaken consisting of the exchange of PhD research students between UCT and UEA, for average periods of 3 months. Research has been conducted that will promote future South African well being, the exchange has facilitated the gaining of multi-disciplinary scientific skills and Integration has been achieved in such a way that will make future inter-country working more likely

CHALLENGES OVERCOME
UCT campus closures over student fees protests have meant that the two UEA students were not able to be on campus at the start of their exchanges and it has hampered discussions. 

On a more practical basis, UK regulations have meant that the UCT student could not open a bank account during her 3-month stay. Other financial arrangements had to be put in place involving direct payment of rent etc but these were unusual and complex and meant financial uncertainty for the student at the onset of her stay. As this was the first student the issue should be sorted out for future visitors.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>5D6CCCD0-0846-41F0-B33C-6F67DD801E4E</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56def78b8f0c73.01124276</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Energy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>After one year of exchange we already see benefits to the UCT-UEA partnerships. The benefits are both for the individual projects the individuals taking part and for the wider consortium. 

For Jana Hofmann, the partnership has helped her and her supervisor to develop local knowledge to better understand the value of carbon offsets for the local economy. The partnership has helped to identify the main stakeholders for her research and to facilitate new skills like networking and generating new ideas for research collaborations. The partnership has been essential to her work and provided a great learning curve in terms of how non-UK institutions operate in the research environment. The initiative has been an essential stepping-stone to learn about different research methodologies academics use to assess carbon offset projects. 

For Rebecca (Becki) Wright, the partnership has helped focus her work on jellyfish on the key species that affect the South African environment, which have repercussions globally. Rebecca is located in the Oceanography Departtment with close ties (especially socially) with the post grads in the lab of her supervisor which is in Biosciences. This is useful for facing and resolving the challenges of interdisciplinary work. 

For Kulthoum Omari, the partnership has helped to link teams between UEA and UCT who were working on the same large research project of the governance of climate change adaptation. This has allowed both the UEA and UCT teams to interact more than we otherwise would have been able to. This has also enabled the two groups to think more about our joint area of work - which they are pursuing in two different geographical regions. The student is hoping to write a co-authored paper, which would be of benefit to both groups.
Interworking between the two universities has been good, in particular Kulthoum Omari attended the Tyndall Assembly where she played a very active part in a number of discussions relating to climate change research, relevant to both issues in the UK and in South Africa. Kulthoum also made over 100 other attendees aware of some of the issues that she felt were important and this had strong benefit in encouraging cultural understanding.

Rebecca Wright reported that the placement of her with a local family was very helpful, particularly as there were troubles at the UCT university at that time.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Two large research grants are being developed between UCT and UEA, which stem directly from the interactions during the first year.

During the period of the placements communication surrounding the placements increased dramatically between the universities. There were a number of online seminars and presentations that were shared on the subject of climate change within the specialist areas of the students. The impact was clearly that digital communications could be achieved between the universities using the physical swap as a catalyst, it must also be said that there have been a number of technical issues relating to the software used to facilitate the exchange of presentations that has had to be overcome. We had repeated technical issues and cancellations, but even for those seminars that were streamed the attendance has been low</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>54C368EF-3E3B-4DFC-9A55-797510654D82</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56def7794bae91.03738562</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Energy,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N013948/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Climate &amp; Climate Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E05CFC1B-8264-49AB-8A54-E3A86F404707</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Marine environments</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>62DCC1BF-B512-4BDB-A0C3-02BC17E15F6B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biogeochemical Cycles</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Climate &amp; Climate Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>C29F371D-A988-48F8-BFF5-1657DAB1176F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ocean - Atmosphere Interact.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>723BA0F8-3ECD-4E2A-A39E-44936EAC1517</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ocean Circulation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>396591D1-8226-43A9-991D-8E0D265D99D0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Regional &amp; Extreme Weather</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>C11BDEA9-7D9D-4728-B6A9-31032921B328</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Newton</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
