The decision to progress is determined by the expression of transcription factors that function as molecular gatekeepers, with simple changes in levels resulting in dramatic changes in phenotype or developmental potential. Understanding the regulation of such transcription factors in response to developmental and environmental stimuli is therefore crucial to understanding the signalling pathways involved in lineage and functional differentiation and how these interact. We are interested in the transcription factor BLIMP-1 which affects the expression of hundreds of genes in the developing cells of the immune system. This factor can coordinate the silencing of genes and reorganise the structure of other genes to activate genetic programmes. We have identified that this factor is responsive to stimuli which signal stress conditions to the cell. Furthermore, we have evidence that BLIMP-1 can potentially alter gene expression in the context of inflammation as may be experienced in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or atherosclerosis. Our proposal aims to investigate the nature of the stress conditions that trigger BLIMP-1 expression and how this may influence the response of the immune system.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>BLIMP-1 is a transcription factor that is required to complete terminal differentiation of B-cell and myeloid lineages into plasma cells and macrophages, respectively. We have now identified BLIMP-1 as a target of stress-induced pathways. The upregulation of BLIMP-1 in response to stress provides a means to alter effector function and may be relevant in disease states characterised by inflammation. Little is known about how BLIMP-1 is regulated. However, such information is critical in order to understand how developmental and environmental signalling pathways impinge on BLIMP-1 expression. We will therefore investigate the impact of physiological stress on BLIMP-1 expression and how this in turn dictates the transcriptomes of mature macrophages. Elucidation of how BLIMP-1 is regulated and subsequently shapes the immune response will improve our understanding of the networks linking differentiation, stress and function.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>278264</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>BLIMP-1 represses microRNA-21 during plasma cell differentiation</gtr:description><gtr:form>Scientific meeting (conference/symposium etc.)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4B760E37-6EFA-4070-803A-9547E553EA8F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Oral presentation at Keystone Conference 2011:

In particular, T cells are exposed to the low tryptophan microenvironment created by IDO1as they are recruited to participate in the immune response. At present, the downstream components linking exposure of low tryptophan to the attenuation of T cell responses remain uncharacterized. However, the fate of effector and regulatory T cells is controlled and re-routed through the expression of BLIMP-1. Thus, in cells of both the monocytic and T cell lineages, the stress-mediated up-regulation of BLIMP-1 may contribute more widely to the immunoregulatory effects of the IDO1 and offers new possibilities for targeting these pathways.

Our data further extend the actions of BLIMP-1 to the control of a microRNA, which regulates gene expression at post-transcriptional level. miR-21 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of epithelial and central nervous system tumors acting through repression of pro-apototic genes, and contributes to characteristic microRNA signatures in DLBCL, myeloma, and Hodgkin's lymphoma. Loss of control over miR-21 expression is therefore likely to contribute substantially to the effects of BLIMP-1 inactivation in B-cell malignancies. Defining the targets of mir-21 in B-cells and the wider impact of BLIMP-1 on microRNA expression patterns will be important avenues for future investigation.</gtr:description><gtr:id>CB6DA037-452F-40EE-AA59-419AE8B66D07</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>54536a4d8b5d13.45462345</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, or IDO, plays an important role in the immune system by keeping responses in check. IDO exerts its effect through the depletion of the amino acid tryptophan. Amino acid starvation triggers key survival pathways in individual cells. We have identified that a transcription factor called BLIMP-1 is made during this response. We have further shown that an important job of BLIMP-1 during this response is to turn off the IDO enzyme and thus bring the response to an end.



The transcriptional repressor BLIMP-1 regulates gene expression and cell fate. The DNA sequence bound by BLIMP-1 overlaps with that recognised by interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), which respond to inflammatory/immune signals. At such sites, BLIMP-1 and IRFs can counter-regulate activity. To address how extensively this occurs, we identified an extended set of sites occupied by BLIMP-1. Genes linked to occupied promoters containing overlapping BLIMP-1/IRF motifs were sensitive to the levels of the competing transcription factors.



microRNAs are a class of small RNAs that can turn off the expression of genes. They are expressed during normal development but are also abnormally expressed in tumour cells. Micro-RNA-21 is the most frequently deregulated microRNA in malignancy. We have shown that BLIMP-1 turns off micro-RNA-21 as a B-cell becomes an antibody secreting plasma cell. Our findings place BLIMP-1 in an important regulatory loop that governs the fate of differentiating B-cells.</gtr:description><gtr:id>43C9952B-7BF1-4996-948A-84E3B5977C77</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-8852406459.723047776fbe92</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4A0960FE-B850-448E-909D-24DDBF60CDC4</gtr:id><gtr:title>BLIMP-1 and STAT3 counterregulate microRNA-21 during plasma cell differentiation.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9c2ec152fe48a86d55fefbceb611b93c"><gtr:id>9c2ec152fe48a86d55fefbceb611b93c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Barnes NA</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0022-1767</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d089089042c936</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1D06AD05-1A5B-4CB2-B638-EC87A93E9AF0</gtr:id><gtr:title>An extended set of PRDM1/BLIMP1 target genes links binding motif type to dynamic repression.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nucleic acids research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6fc6da1d29ae4ca40c3da21395c649f7"><gtr:id>6fc6da1d29ae4ca40c3da21395c649f7</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Doody GM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0305-1048</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d0470478649b87</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>58AA60EE-EFDD-402E-B092-C82EF8692827</gtr:id><gtr:title>Amino acid deprivation links BLIMP-1 to the immunomodulatory enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9c2ec152fe48a86d55fefbceb611b93c"><gtr:id>9c2ec152fe48a86d55fefbceb611b93c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Barnes NA</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0022-1767</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d0890890119b84</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/E000746/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
