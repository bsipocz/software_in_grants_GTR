&lt;p>This two year programme of events examines the extent to which austerity fundamentally alters conceptions of futures and explores the social and cultural effects of this shift. It looks at how the future is imagined, planned for and worked towards, and at how certain visions, expectations and promises about the future are brought into beingthrough technologies of modelling, forecasting, and planning across a wide range of fields including security, science, health and medicine, new media, design, engineering, and urban and population unrest. Bringing together leading researchers from the UK, USA, Australia and Europe with those working on methodologies for mapping the future in the public, private and third sectors, the series provides a forum for the exchange of ideas and information, stimulates debate and discussion and establishes a new research agenda on futures.&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>There will be non-academic beneficiaries both during and following the research period. We have identified the following as the primary users and beneficiaries:

Industry, think tanks and government departments concerned with futures and austerity
Conceptions of the future are highly relevant to policy-making, trend forecasting and product design and these conceptions are made more prevalent in the context of austerity, where certain groups of people are described as having 'no future' (see Clegg 2011). Thus a range of people will be interested in the exchange of information and ideas. The participation of speakers from industry and the public sector at each event, and particularly at Seminar 4, will benefit these sectors during the series itself. For example, we will invite speakers to participate in the series from:
- The Work Foundation, the leading independent authority on work and its future: http://www.theworkfoundation.com/
- Foresight the 'horizon scanning' Department for Business, Innovation and Skills programme with interests in digital technologies, new media, population, finance, health and wellbeing: http://www.bis.gov.uk/foresight
- Technology Strategy Board, the UK's leading innovation agency, interested in new technology based products for future markets: http://www.innovateuk.org/
- The Futures Company, specialising in future trends and modelling techniques and with whom John Urry is currently working: http://blog.thefuturescompany.com/

Social movements: the third sector, charities and more informal social movements
These users will also benefit from and be interested in the research. For example, versions of and methods for modelling future climate change will be of interest to environmental campaigners, predictions for a rise in obesity will be of interest to health campaigners and charities and, more broadly, images of dystopian or diminished futures will be of interest to educational, social justice and equality movements. 

Publics 
The ideas about whether or not the future is diminished in a shift to an austerity society and the wide range of topics the series will explore, are likely to capture the imagination of wider publics who follow current affairs.

See Pathways to Impact statement for details of how these users will be engaged.

How will they benefit?
While not over-emphasising its potential impact, the series is likely to benefit the users specified above through the development of knowledge and understanding of the visions and methods of capturing the future, and of the effects of austerity on the ways in which the future is both imagined and lived out in the present. The series is organised around the exchange of knowledge and ideas and will benefit, firstly, participants throughout its two year duration. Secondly, following the series this exchange of knowledge and ideas has the capacity to generate research to improve the critical understanding of the future of those in industry and public services/policy making which may, in turn, have consequences for the ways in which, for example, products are designed, scenarios visualised and policy made. 

Academics, perhaps especially early career/postgraduate participants, will develop research and professional skills through learning about methodological approaches, ways of working and best practice from industry, the public sector and the third sector.

Given the series involves the formation of a network to exchange ideas, information and ways of working so that academic and non-academic users may learn from each other, these results may not be immediate. However, following the impact achieved throughout the series, we envision the research generated to be absorbed into prevalent ways of thinking about the future.

We will explore opportunities that arise throughout the series to collaborate with non-academic participants to expand research agendas and widen impact following the seminar.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-08-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-12-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>17928</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Findings from the seminar series have been published by The Conversation to reach a non-academic audience.

The aim of the seminar series was to facilitate discussion between academics and non-academics on how the future is imagined, planned for and brought into being, what conceptions of the future tell us about the present, and whether the current 'age of austerity' has impacted on imaginations and materialisations of the future. The series helped to foster a network of international researchers on this topic, and to provide a base from which further research projects, including those involving empirical research, could be generated.

Events were organised by academics based in Sociology, Geography and Design Departments at Goldsmiths, University of London, Lancaster University, University of York and Durham University, Speakers at the events included academics and those working in the hi-tech industry, art and design, and a think tank, and were drawn from Australia, United Stated of America and the Netherlands, as well as the UK. The final conference attracted 100 international delegates, including many postgraduate students. 

Some events were paper/presentation based, and others were designed as workshops to include practical activities and/or 'brainstorming' for further projects.

Through the grant, members of the seminar series have developed a range of more concrete plans to expand on further. These include: the need for the development of theoretical frameworks to research and understand time and futures; the need for the development of creative methods to research and understand the intangibility of time; the need to consider how austerity measures have effects not only in the present but also in the future. 

In addition, a number of outputs from the project are in process: see below.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The initial findings from the seminar series are been taken forward by members of the series in the following ways. These include: an edited edition of New Formations on austerity, indebtedness and politics, edited by seminar series member Rebecca Bramall and including contributions from other seminar series members; a series of artists' film screenings, discussions and workshops with artists and academics to develop visual methods for researching futurity and disasters, led by seminar series members Rebecca Coleman, Michael Guggenheim and Yasmina Reggad; a proposal for a two-year project studying the multi-media texts via which time and futures are encountered and experienced has been submitted by Coleman (September 2014); a panel of an international conference, the Association of American Geographers, has been accepted for April 2015 on the topic of 'the present', led by seminar series member Ben Anderson and including other seminar series members. A proposal for a panel on 'the present' has also been submitted for consideration for the British Sociological Association Annual conference, April 2015 (led by Coleman, October 2014). A proposal for a special issue of an academic journal based on the final conference will be submitted in November 2014, edited by seminar series members Coleman and Richard Tutton.

The findings of these projects, and the seminar series more generally, might also be taken forward by policy-makers in terms of the affects of austerity on both manifestations and imaginations of the future.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C3E21D87-3FBC-4FCF-B6CA-B111399BEEFA</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544a4ddaed20d9.25945575</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.austerityfutures.org.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>DDAC9582-E403-4B0C-963A-427601DCCBFC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Transforming Images: Screens, Affect, Futures</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/355a9e87df3b5ec78d5b6358ce70afdd"><gtr:id>355a9e87df3b5ec78d5b6358ce70afdd</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Coleman, R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-13-882060-9</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>543ba8c359a682.47545017</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/J021512/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:parents><gtr:parent><gtr:id>AC9631AE-BCE6-4112-9F96-1F01D6A265C9</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>ES/J021512/1</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>17928.38</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2012-12-14</gtr:start><gtr:end>2013-08-01</gtr:end><gtr:children><gtr:child rel="Transfer"><gtr:id>A03A59A0-B669-4F59-B3DB-9BC5C852BB1E</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>ES/J021512/2</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>12133.64</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2013-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2014-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:children/></gtr:child></gtr:children></gtr:parent></gtr:parents></gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>608431EA-925E-44D8-A1E2-8C24B4768085</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9E4BDAC2-CD51-4625-BCC1-5F768EE168D0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3FB490ED-1150-4B72-BB38-E3A211952C34</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Science &amp; Technology Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
