Two major BBC television documentaries about him in January 2010 explored the contradictions between his public image (as the controversially-dubbed 'Lawrence of Arabia'), and the private individual who regarded his past with feelings of guilt and failure. Notwithstanding this sense of internal fissure, Lawrence's public persona has fed into numerous forms of cultural production: David Lean's film, 'Lawrence of Arabia' (remastered in 1989); plays and novels incorporating him; discussions of Lawrence's relevance to debates about models of masculinity within postmodernity, etc. This research project will result in a major monograph which, avoiding the psycho-biographical or purely historical orientation which has already featured heavily in existing Lawrence scholarship, will approach Lawrence in terms of why he remains a reference point within contemporary culture and literature. What does the case study of Lawrence reveal about the reasons why some public figures continue to resonate with ongoing critical debate, and others fade away? Why do figures such as Lawrence seem to be necessary sounding boards within postmodern interrogations of subject position and identity? \n\nIn approaching these questions, this book will explore the problematics of Lawrence's insertion into contemporary postcolonialist debates. To what extent is Edward Said (in his 'Orientalism') right to align Lawrence with a white imperialist perspective, and how may this perception be reconciled with alternative views which construct Lawrence as profoundly anti-imperialist? What these and other divergences reveal are the plurality of meanings which have gathered around Lawrence and which lend dynamism to his shape-shifting within culture. Other paradoxes around Lawrence derive from his dual self-positioning both as active combatant in the 1916 Arab Revolt and as artist-memorialiser of that conflict, in his best-known book, 'Seven Pillars of Wisdom'. This work will be assessed in terms of its literary qualities, but also via a comparative study of its many translations into French in the past two decades (most recently in 2009), which throw valuable light on how the 'translational' Lawrence contributes to the multiple realisations of the 'transnational' Lawrence. In considering the case study of 'Trans-Manche' Lawrence (Lawrence in French-speaking contexts), a further under-researched area - that of his influence on key French writers and intellectuals, such as Gilles Deleuze and Andr&amp;eacute; Malraux - will be explored. The book will argue that Lawrence has become a transnational figure not only because of the cross-cultural travelling of his works ('Seven Pillars' as well as other postwar writing such as 'The Mint') but also because he is a border figure, inscribed within the transient identities of a globalised world.\n\nIn addition to the monograph and three conference papers/panels aimed at diverse audiences, the applicant will organise a series of public lectures at Reading University in 2011, inserting aspects of the Lawrence findings into a wider context of war and its documentation, and linking up with two other current research projects on War being conducted at Reading. These lectures will connect with current public interest in Lawrence, taking the debate further towards an appraisal of his status as a cultural vehicle in the twenty-first century. They will also contain references to previously unpublished Lawrence material held in Reading University Publishers' Archive. A further link with local public interest is the fact that Lawrence claims to have lost almost the entire manuscript of 'Seven Pillars of Wisdom' while changing trains at Reading Station, in 1919, necessitating a complete rewriting. Given these specific regional links,BBC Radio Berkshire has already expressed interest in covering these lectures.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>- T. E. Lawrence is already a polyvalent figure with a remarkably diverse set of academic, professional, and public audiences. Academic beneficiaries have already been stated. Public interest is manifest in the consistent stream of newspaper articles about Lawrence, the frequency of Lawrence-related items being advertised on online auction sites, and the plethora of popular books about his life. Within the general public, the educational charity, the T E Lawrence Society, has some 1000 members, mainly in Britain, France, and America. It sponsors regional groups who hold regular meetings and visits in many parts of the UK. The Society also holds an international 2-day biennial conference, attended mainly by members of the public, rather than academics. The applicant has already attended several of these conferences, and has given a well-received plenary paper (afterwards published in the Society's Journal) on reactions to Lawrence among 20th century French intellectuals. A further paper will be offered for the 2012 conference. Professional audiences include politicians, diplomats, and military education personnel. In May 2005, a 'Times' article reported how Lawrence's work on the importance of cultural sensitivity was recommended reading for both US officers in Iraq and for British officers training at Sandhurst. Yet anti-war activists have also used Lawrence's hostile remarks about colonialist agendas after World War I in support of their own arguments. These multiple readerships illustrate the diverse ways in which Lawrence is accessed across a range of disciplines and cultural spaces. In its analysis of these complex intersections, this book will benefit all the above, plus an important additional group of users: cultural commentators and journalists.\n\n- There already exist ongoing bibliographies of printed Lawrence material. What is now needed is a method of navigating through the diversity of cultural outputs associated with the transnational Lawrence. In exploring the use made of Lawrence as a cultural vehicle, the proposed book, conference papers and journal articles will address themselves to all the constituencies mentioned above. They will impact on understandings of the conditions in which figures like Lawrence are enabled to gain currency and cultural longevity through a series of mutations. Timescale: publication and dissemination across 2011/12. The public lectures at Reading will enable Lawrence to be placed in a wider global context of reflection about war and peace, including linkages with other 20th and 21st century conflicts. Timescale: 2011/12.\n\n- The publication of the book with a major publisher (currently being considered by Oxford University Press, with whom the applicant has published in the past) will ensure widespread marketing and publicity. The chosen outlet for the Special Session is the MLA Annual Convention, since this prominent US conference attracts high levels of participation and press coverage on both sides of the Atlantic. The impact of the public lectures will be ensured by working with BBC Radio Berkshire (who have already expressed interest in covering the debates). It is intended to include in the broadcast short interviews with members of the public who attend the lectures, and the lectures will also be followed by question and answer sessions involving speakers and audience. Insofar as the research uses material from the University's Special Collections, provisional plans have been made with the University Archivist for the applicant to present a lecture in the Lunchtime Network series, part of a regular public programme held on the site of Special Collections, in central Reading. Listings for these lectures reach a wide audience through a monthly e-bulletin, and a link will also be set up with the Special Collections website, which will include a feature on those parts of the Lawr</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>90901</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I002057/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1AE825FC-C165-4D0F-B712-D5FA662046AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>French Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
