change.</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/M008339/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Disabled people's lives are often devalued, by comparison with others' (ODI, 2011). For instance, there are scandals in care homes (Flynn, 2012) and in the health service (Heslop et al., 2013; Francis, 2012) and we know that social care is struggling due to financial cuts (Woods et al., 2011). Disabled people have long said that they can provide solutions for themselves (Oliver &amp;amp; Barnes, 2012) and this notion is now embraced by government policy which aims for disabled people to exercise 'choice and control' over their own lives. In all these areas, there are policies that identify the potential problems and lay out by contrast the person-centred goals of government (DH, 2012). 

The problem is therefore not about a lack of appropriate policy, but the gap between that policy and its enactment in practice. There are many areas in which research has shown what works, but in which we do not yet know how to stimulate and maintain changes in practice. Instead of simply describing the barriers faced by disabled people, we will focus instead on mechanisms of change, aiming to find out what theoretical ideas have practical adequacy. This research aims to focus on how to develop and sustain practices that are on the terms of disabled people themselves.

Phase 1: Theories The first key word in our title is 'Co-production', where disabled people's own solutions are in the spotlight. The DRUK (Disability Rights UK) is a partner in this project, and will lead our thinking about co-production. Disabled people are centrally involved across the various strands, and we will collect evidence about the process of co-production from the point of view of all those involved in the study itself. Our second key word is 'change' and we will form a 'Getting Things Changed' group, starting with a series of seminars on: 1) user-driven change; 2) interventionist conversation analysis; 3) social practice theory; 4) theories of 'sense making'. These will kick-start a sustained dialogue across the length of the project.

Phase 2: Research based Interventions The central part of the study is organised into five parallel research based interventions, to identify problematic social practices and work out how to tackle them. Each strand delivers action and insight about how to make changes on the terms of a specific grouping of disabled people and within a different layer of social life. All of these are areas in which research has already revealed problems of practice. The five strands focus on 1) how to improve everyday interaction between people using primarily non-verbal means of communication and their support workers, 2) how to change practices in universities, which unintentionally marginalise disabled students; 3) how to shift health care practices by making 'reasonable adjustments', 4) how to develop better interdisciplinary support for parents with learning difficulties, particularly where child protection issues have been raised; 5) how to affect statutory commissioning of social care by listening to disabled people's own solutions. In each of these areas, we will work with disabled people, to help identify improvements and understand how to sustain them. 

Phase 3: Embedding Change Impact is both an outcome and a focus of the study, running through everything we do. The final phase will bring these activities together in academic outputs, policy impact and in dissemination to a network of disability organisations, as we did in the recent Confidential Inquiry (Heslop et al., 2013). Disability Rights UK and its networks are equally a key to our routes to impact, and we are well placed at NFRC to disseminate via disability events and journals. Following our three sets of project briefings for policy makers, during this final period we will hold events led by each of the five strands, and a public dissemination event at a media centre in Bristol.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>WHO WILL BENEFIT, AND IN WHAT WAY?
The key practice beneficiaries for this research fall into three groups: 1) disabled people and their organisations; 2) education, social care and health policy makers and practitioners; 3) practitioners, NGOs and organisations involved with specific groups of disabled people.
1) Disabled people and their organisations (via DRUK &amp;amp; member organisations): we will suggest strategies for tackling inequities experienced by disabled people, by foregrounding the voice and agency of disabled people, and by providing evidence of 'what works' in shifting social practices. Our findings will be fed back directly to DPOs, and to campaigns led by disabled people.
2) Policy makers (e.g. via NHS England, Association of Directors of Adult Social Care): we will contribute to debates about 'challenging culture' , by enabling research evidence to be examined through different theoretical lenses on change. Policy briefings will be disseminated at Months 4, 18, 28 and 35 at key moments following project learning events, and also via blogs and interactive media. Advisory groups in each of the strands, as well as the final-stage policy impact discussions, will enable us to engage with practice guidance, such as guidance for commissioners in local authorities. 
3) NGOs and provider or support organisations (e.g. Alzheimers Society, Mencap, Centre for Studies on Inclusive Education): a range of organisations representing particular interests in the disability world, and provider organisations, have signed up to support this project. We will also invite others, such as the Mental Health Foundation, to sit on advisory panels, and they will all benefit from regular strand and cross-project updates about findings, which they will be able to feed into practice (e.g. via training of staff) and into policy (e.g. for disabled parents). 

WHAT ARE THE IMPACT GOALS?
Impact is both the topic and the outcome of this project. The goal is to analyze how changes in policies, practices and outcomes for disabled people can be brought about. By building in a central partnership with DRUK, the research messages will be informed by their voice in public debate, and by working with theorists, we will engage with wider interdisciplinary social science debates. The research messages will have impact at two levels:
1) Research evidence about how practices and policy can be shifted, using direct practical examples that foreground the voice of 'users' of the research, in relation to everyday life interactions (Strand 1), inclusion in HE (Strand 2), health service adjustments (Strand 3) social support for parents with learning disabilities (Strand 4) and social care and health commissioning (Strand 5). We will feed these insights into specific policies and strategic documents, via our regular web-based briefings, and the policy meetings detailed in Pathways to Impact. 
2) We will contribute to the debate about how research can be linked with impact. For instance, both Strands 3 and 5 will examine the way in which 'dissemination of innovation' can help local authorities or health trusts to implement policy.

HOW WILL WE ACHIEVE IMPACT?
Our key strategies to engage with our various stakeholders are detailed in 'Pathways to Impact'. In summary, they include ongoing work with DRUK and disabled people throughout the project, and an advisory group structure which will help to disseminate messages from our work. An advisory group specific to each strand will involve both policy makers and disabled people, so that their voice is central throughout the research, and the fifth strand turns the spotlight onto disabled people as agents of change, focusing on the ways in which individuals and groups of disabled people can influence statutory provision. We will host a project website and use social media, to publicise our regular research briefings in short accessible formats, and monitor the impact of the work throughout the study.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1346912</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A workshop was held in April 2014 which was facilitated by Dr Val Williams, Dr Sue Porter and Dr Stanley Blue.

This audience took part in the Forum Theatre presentation as 'spectactors', and several also contributed individual interviews for the research. The overall impact was to support the idea of training to be carried out by disabled students, to improve practices in universities. This matter has since been discussed by the student group with the Pro-Vice Chancellor of the University of Bristol, and will be instituted within a planned future online training offer to University staff. Other points the students are pursuing relate to accessible signage within the University, and engagement with the new Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Steering Committee.

DEEP stands for Developing Evidence-Enriched Practice, and was a useful way to approach the idea of dialogic learning. Val presented on the topic of: 'The Inclusion of People who are Seldom Heard', with some emerging findings from Strand 2 (Changing the Academy) and Strand 1 (Getting Good Support), both of which form part of the large study on 'Tackling Disabling Practices: co-production and change'. The day proved to be a very useful forum for networking and exchange of ideas with practitioners, activists and policy makers, many from Wales, but also more generally in the South West and nationally. Specifically, there was a strong exchange of views on how we can both listen to disabled people's experiences and stories, but also analyse and take action on the basis of these stories. A full list of participants' details and their interests in quality assurance was circulated, providing for very good networking opportunities for our project.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b84e42d65931.44175593</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ruru.ac.uk/pdf/nov2015/Nick%20Andrews%20PRESENTATION%20-%2009nov15.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Advisory meetings on Reasonable Adjustments in Health Care</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>61778380-EA68-435C-8140-CD29F5BDAF37</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In 2016, Dr Stuart Read organised two meetings with a learning disability advocacy group, and two meetings with a pan-disability group.

Disabled participants in the programme spoke strongly about their identities, and their lack of identification with 'negative' aspects of disability. This has some resonance with one of our emerging findings, relating to the difficulty of (self) identification for disabled patients in the NHS and for disabled employees. We plan to take this further by reflecting on the issues raised in the debate, particularly in relation to people with learning disabilities and people with dementia.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c0009b2069e2.71300001</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://bcfmradio.com/wellbeing</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Co-production workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F2677435-330A-4024-B5B7-9D6347697685</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This co-production workshop took place on September 20th 2016, and was structured around presentations from four groups working with our project. All of them represent different disabled people, and we had presentations from people with dementia, people with learning disabilities, and a group of university students with disabilities. This was a unique occasion for discussion between people with different disabilities, to share perspectives on inclusion and on the social practices which exclude them, and for learning about the process of co-production in research. We discussed specifically the emotional content of co-production, the support which disabled people can give to each other, and the subtle barriers that they face (for instance in Universities, as well as in Health Care). Hearing directly from people with dementia about their experience of diagnosis was extremely powerful, and sparked many discussions with other participants about their own experiences. We reflected and recorded our thoughts about how this day would enable us to think more deeply about co-production, and had some very thoughtful feedback from participants.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c172bbc0fb00.09047429</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Patients, carers and/or patient groups</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.bristol.ac.uk/sps/gettingthingschanged/workshops/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>4th Workshop Ongoing Conversation About Change</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A5485A9A-004C-4FC5-9997-261A2E7E6BD5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In the 4th workshop Val Williams made a presentation about the the ongoing conversation of change and the challenges for disability research and analysis of social practice.

Our introduction stressed that parents may not have the necessary resources. However, it is equally important that professionals do not have the time, knowledge and skills to support them appropriately.
This fourth strand thus focuses on change at the level of implementation of policy, aiming to understand what strategic policies make a difference in 'successful' practice to support parents with learning difficulties. Despite UK legislation and policy (Children Act 1989; DH/DoE, 2007), parents with learning difficulties are more likely than others to have their children removed from their care (McConnell and Llewellyn, 2002; Masson et al, 2008). Parents are seen as neglecting their children because they do not have the resources, knowledge, skills, experiences and support they need (Cleaver and Nicholson 2007) while professionals are regarded as not having the necessary time, skills and support to work with them (Tarleton et al 2007; DoH/DoE 2007; Jones 2013). However, there is an increasing awareness of how parents with learning difficulties can be positively supported via adapted materials, support services and additional time (DoH/DoE 2007; Tarleton and Porter 2012; Tarleton &amp;amp; Turney, 2013). What is now needed is a better understanding of the facilitators and barriers to 'successful' practice, so that we can know more accurately how to implement change for parents with learning difficulties. 
The discussions in this workshop with disabled people helped us to recognise the need to look at all types of cases that are seen as successful (even if only in particular aspects) by practitioners and parents, even if the eventual outcome is removal of the child/ren as there could be radical differences in parents' responses. Following this workshop, in designing our research, we made decisions to ask parents (and children) about what &amp;quot;practices&amp;quot; worked, from their point of view, as well as the practitioners' point of view. In this way, we will aim to ensure that the parents' and children's views are as central and valid as those of practitioners. This is a clear stance for this strand.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6d255d682c3.22391775</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Patients, carers and/or patient groups</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description> 14th International Pragmatics Conference</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>43B4F8F3-FBB9-4DD0-9005-E32FD7849DB3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation on Peer Research as part of the panel 'Tell me all about it': interactional dynamics in research interviews, led by Kathryn Roulston and Val Williams.

Therefore, the eventual impact of the study will be seen in the application of this learning about how changes happen. In order to develop those understandings, we are working across a canvas of five different empirical strands of research, and within those strands, some of the research is taking an 'action' approach where we are working with community groups or other organisations to make changes which are beneficial to disabled people. 
At this stage, we can therefore report on:
a) Developing partnerships where we are taking the conversations about change forward.
b) Specific actions to effect or re-shape problems being faced by disabled people.

DEVELOPING PARTNERSHIPS
Working partnerships within our research have been developed with NGOs and networks who are themselves seeking to take action on change. Examples of these include the 'DEEP' Network (the UK Network of Dementia Voices) which is represented in our advisory group. Through our collaboration with them, we are carrying out research by actively involving a group of people with dementia in Swindon, and will be able to show that people with that diagnosis can be have a voice in research. In turn, they become change agents by demonstrating how practices in dementia care could contribute to their 'empowerment'. We are also partnering with a drama group in Bristol run by people with learning disabilities, the 'Misfits', who have used findings to create dramas about their support services and interactions with professionals.
A third example of a partnership which has been made is with Openup Music, a Bristol based NGO, working to change the exclusionary practices of music making, so that music become more 'open' to individual disabled people who can create and develop their own profile as musicians via high-quality musical performance. The project will be able to reflect on the way this process happens within schools, thus creating pathways for wider impact of Openup Music.

SUCCESSFUL ACTIONS TO MAKE CHANGES
One strand of our research is concerned with 'Changing the Academy', and is led by disabled students in the University, as well as disabled staff. Via an event in the ESRC 'Thinking Futures Festival' in Bristol, the student group have since met with the Pro Vice-Chancellor to offer their services as 'trainers' in disability issues for staff in the University, and that is currently under discussion. 
The disabled staff part of this strand has also created direct change within the University, by taking action for instance on proposals for disabled staff car parking arrangements, and by advising on an Equality and Diversity post to be advertised soon under the Elizabeth Blackwell Institute within the University. 
A further example is taken from the 'User Driven Commissioning' strand of our research, where we have facilitated the formation of a group of disabled people who have worked with their local authority on the commissioning of Direct Payments support services, and gained agreement from that authority where they will co-assess the bids and have a 20% stake in the final contract award.
These are a few examples of a wider portfolio of change activities, all of which form instances for reflection and learning about how to 'get things changed'. Our project is developing links between this type of action research, and wider theoretical understandings of social practice, co-production and change.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>E6883D60-F065-4087-82BA-9393BEDB2645</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d47b76cdcf10.36182403</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We are still conducting the empirical research in this study, and so final findings cannot yet be released. However, as planned, we have been addressing chiefly the first three objectives over the past year:
1) identify the barriers facing disabled people in the UK, and understand better how social practices get 'stuck';
2) discuss and connect micro and macro theories of social practice, by applying them within the field of disability;
3) explore disabled people's own solutions, and understand better the conditions under which 'co-production' can have an effect on practice.

Emerging findings on the first objective have been shared across the five strands; for instance, we know that the reporting of 'reasonable adjustments' in Health services is very variable, and often non-existent. We also know that this is partly at least because of a lack of identification of disabled patients in the NHS. Further, that problem of lack of identification shows itself again in Strands 2 and 5, which both have an interest in the employment of disabled staff (in universities, and in the NHS). Lack of disclosure of a disability is linked in turn with the lack of reasonable adjustments made by an organisation. In each of our strands, we have highlighted how hard it is to see policy translated into practice in a linear fashion. 

We have also therefore done some work, as planned, to work out how micro elements of practices are connected with wider social practice theories, and have examples in our data from Strand 1 which show how disabled people can become excluded from interactions, from activities, and from wider social practices in everyday life. These include for instance the exclusion from consumer choice in shops, the exclusion from social activities, and the exclusion from an 'equal' conversation on their own terms. 

Our findings will reflect strongly the views and insights of disabled people themselves, both from within the research team, through Disability Rights UK, and also in the work we are doing with groups to co-produce the research. From this angle, we are seeing how problematic practices can arise when disabled people and service users are excluded from decisions, or are only included in a tokenistic way. We have seen examples of how this happens in Universities, and also in health and social care services. We are also finding that there are 'common sense' justifications made for these exclusions, which close off opportunities for change. Applying the lens of Social Practice Theory, we are collecting examples of how organisations and professionals are pulled between different drivers for meeting targets and making cuts, as well as creating opportunities for equality. We have written a summary of some of these ongoing findings as 'Ideas Briefing 4'.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings will extend further to develop practical examples of change and the understandings which will help organisations and individuals to move forward to tackle disabling practices. For instance, we plan to present the findings from Strand 1 within services for people with dementia, including NGOs, and Strand 3 has two workshops during the next month in which solutions for reasonable adjustments in health care will be discussed with health care professionals as well as policy makers and patients. Strand 4 plans to take the findings from 'successful' practices into workshops to move forward the key issues in providing good support to parents with learning difficulties.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>F0A2511A-CE4B-4EB3-AA15-5FC37AD7B492</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d47b012d0430.81784431</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.bristol.ac.uk/sps/gettingthingschanged/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>ED393453-4665-488E-B55F-6EFB2D781A49</gtr:id><gtr:title>Promoting solutions and co-constructing problems - management consultancy and instrument constituencies?</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/fec203795cd78ae6d605dbfa25958476"><gtr:id>fec203795cd78ae6d605dbfa25958476</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Sturdy, A.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56df0910a75484.66518689</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9AB077C7-E9B4-4708-A567-82CBF251FFDB</gtr:id><gtr:title>Conversation takes two: understanding interactions with people with dementia</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Disability &amp; Society</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8114d0c2848b13452ca21e7550d244e4"><gtr:id>8114d0c2848b13452ca21e7550d244e4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Webb J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fc9a8a2eb78.10946564</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>03B103F9-67BE-46C8-9584-E4380C6D7907</gtr:id><gtr:title>Disabled people have often had things done for them, in relationships where they have no power.
