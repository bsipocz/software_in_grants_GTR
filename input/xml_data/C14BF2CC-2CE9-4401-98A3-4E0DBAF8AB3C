The IAG will capture these impacts and select ca. 20 high-impact projects to which they will mobilise the following resources in the form of a Project Exploitation Team which will consist of:KT Mentors: successful entrepreneurs from businesses who will assist and mentor the Exploitation Teams (action learning) and participate in training workshops (for Project Exploitation Teams and a wider audience);KT Champions: an academic mentor from within the University, successful in the transfer of knowledge arising from research to business. We plan to appoint these after the first year and expect that most if not all will have been individuals who have benefited from this Programme; KT Fellowships: A fellowship either buying out academic time from within the University or engaging someone from a third party (businesses and/or research institutions) to work at the University of Bath directly on activities required to exploit EPSRC funded research.The IAG will also approve the allocation of:Proof of Concept (PoC) funding will be set aside to enable Project Exploitation Teams to carry out a small amount of technical development, or marketing, to help understand, or test, a particular market and scope further partnership development projects;Partnership Development Awards will fund partnership development projects, in which the exploitation partner will be expected to commit to further investment following a successful outcome (the criteria for which will be agreed before any award is made). The Partnership Development Awards will be delivered in the form of Knowledge Transfer Partnerships (KTPs), Continuous Professional Development (CPD) Grants, and/or brand new Commercial Adoption Grants (CAGs) as follows:KTPs: we will adopt the national KTP model which funds the employment of one or more graduates to work on a specified project. The graduate works in the company, under the day-to-day supervision of a senior manager. A University member of staff supports the graduate in knowledge transfer process with frequent contact with both the graduate and the senior manager within the company. The University of Bath employs the graduate for the duration of the programme, which gives them the same access to the University facilities and departments as other staff;Commercial Adoption Grants will co-fund the further development of technologies or testing/feasibility studies to be undertaken utilising EPRSC funded ideas, by businesses. A key feature of this Grant is that the UK end-user must set (with the Project Exploitation Team) criteria for a successful outcome, and must commit to either investing in the commercialisation or utilisation of the technology upon success. Continuous Professional Development (CPD) Grants: will co-fund activities to engage employers through tailored modules created and funded in partnership between businesses and the University of BathThe following activities will also capture and celebrate the impact of the KTA:Networking and showcase events in order to celebrate knowledge transfer of EPRSC funded research, discuss concepts and showcase research outputs and prototypes to businesses;Feedback questionnaires and interviews with participating academics, industrial partners, and supporting partners;Case Study Development from new KT activities initiated from within this Programme.The innovative combination of the exciting early strategic interventions by the Impact Assessment Group together with the establishment of Project Exploitation Teams and the allocation of both Proof of Concept funds and Partnership Development Awards, will lead to a greater number of economic and societal impacts, and a sustainable culture of innovation and entrepreneurship within the University.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>3390000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/H500103/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
