It consists of a collection of nodes, some of which are linked by edges. In many application areas, for example in modelling the Internet or a social network, it is natural to think of the graph as generated randomly. My proposed research is about models of random graphs and, in particular, what we may say about large instances of them.

The simplest model is the Erdos-Renyi random graph (ERRG) in which there are n nodes, each pair of which is directly linked by an edge with probability p and not linked otherwise, independently for different pairs of nodes. (We may still be able to travel between two nodes which are not directly linked if there is a path of links leading through other nodes which we may use to get from one to the other; in this case, we say that the two nodes are in the same component of the graph.) One of the many fascinating features of this model is that it undergoes a phase transition, that is a huge change in quantitative behaviour for a small change in the value of the parameter p. (The term phase transition is borrowed from physics, where it is used to describe such sudden changes in physical systems, e.g. water turning into ice or vapour at 0 and 100 degrees respectively.) In the ERRG, the phase transition concerns the component sizes, which are relatively small below the critical value of p, whereas above it, there is one giant component (containing a positive proportion of the nodes) and all of the other components are again small. The most delicate behaviour occurs exactly at this critical point, where there is an intermediate size-scaling and many components of comparable size.

It is natural to ask what happens to the graph as the number of nodes grows. If we simultaneously shrink the lengths of the edges then it is possible that the graph converges. This is the idea of a scaling limit; it tells us information about the macroscopic structure of the components. In earlier work, my co-authors and I were able to give a precise description of the scaling limit of the components in the critical ERRG. It is conjectured that this scaling limit should be the same for a wide range of &amp;quot;high-dimensional&amp;quot; critical random graph models which are obtained by starting from some base graph and then performing a random attack in which some proportion of the edges, chosen at random, are rendered inactive (this is known as percolation). Proving this is one of my aims.

There are many random graph models which behave appreciably differently to the ER case, and their possible scaling limits are typically much more poorly understood; I will investigate these also. Another setting which is much less developed and is where the edges of the graph are directed, so that they point from one node to another. This is the natural way to model the World-Wide Web, where links point from one webpage to another, and will form another focus of my project.

A tree is a graph which has a single component and no cycles. Trees have applications which range from modelling the genealogy of populations through to understanding data structures. Random trees and their scaling limits are currently a topic of intense study, and they form a key part of my project. There is a plethora of different models here arising in a variety of settings. An example which is motivated by a classical optimisation problem is the so-called minimum spanning tree (MST). Inside any connected graph, there are (usually several possible) spanning trees, which represent different ways to connect up the nodes using the smallest number of edges. If each edge has a (potentially random) cost associated for its use, and we still wish to connect all the vertices, then we are interested in finding the MST of the graph. This turns out to behave surprisingly differently to the case where we simply pick a spanning tree uniformly at random. One of my goals is to explore the range of possible behaviours in such trees.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The work outlined in my case for support is theoretical in nature but concerns fundamental mathematical structures which have many important applications.

Trees arise in many contexts, and it is often natural for the purposes of modelling for those trees to be considered to be random. For example:

- genealogies of families and populations;

- data structures and algorithms (e.g. sorting) in Computer Science;

- phylogenetic trees.

Branching processes were originally introduced to model family relationships. More recently, coalescent processes such as Kingman's coalescent have played an absolutely key role in population genetics, with implications for our understanding of, for example, the genetics of diseases. The uniform random tree (whose scaling limit, the Brownian continuum random tree, plays an important part in my research proposal) is closely related to hashing with linear probing. Several algorithms in phylogenetic analysis rely on the sort of natural Markovian operations on trees which one can also seek to understand in the limit and, indeed, the framework of R-trees has been employed in this setting. In all of these contexts, there has been a rich interplay between theory and application, and the work in my proposal will contribute to that interplay.

Networks have, in recent years, emerged as an enormously significant application area. Examples of particular significance are:

- communications networks, including telephone networks, the Internet, the World-Wide Web, ad-hoc mobile networks and peer-to-peer networks;

- social networks;

- the spread of epidemics in human or animal populations, or the spread of digital viruses;

- the modelling of biological networks such as protein interaction networks, or the structural and functional connections in the human brain.

Network science is flourishing. This proposal addresses the need to reinforce the theoretical underpinnings of the applied work in this area, and particularly to understand the mechanisms which give rise to real-world behaviour. To give some examples: studying percolation on a graph yields insight into the robustness of a network under random attack; understanding how different rules for the evolution of a random network give rise to different degree distributions gives an insight into how a real-world network may have evolved. These ideas are particularly important as many real-world social or communications networks are so large that we have only incomplete information about them. Part of my proposal concerns directed random graphs, which are the most natural model for many real-world networks including the World-Wide Web. Research into directed graphs is much less developed than for their undirected counterparts and understanding quantities such as diameters here could have a significant impact on the modelling of these networks. Potential beneficiaries, in the longer term, could include telecommunications and Internet companies.

Training opportunities:

This project will employ two postdoctoral researchers, who will work under my supervision. My department has also guaranteed me a funded PhD studentship, for a student who will work with me on part of the project (and there is certainly scope for other PhD students to become involved if funding is available). These individuals will receive training which they will be able to apply in various employment sectors, especially those where an understanding of networks or random processes and structures is important. Skills in research, preparation of papers, presentation of results, and collaboration with other researchers are all key for undertaking an academic career. But these skills are also highly prized in many careers outside academia. For example, the ability to prepare a clear and rigorous account of a piece of technical work, or the ability to present one's work to an audience of either experts or non-experts, are key skills in most industrial settings.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1062939</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1845ED48-FD8C-42D1-8663-65D1021A753F</gtr:id><gtr:title>The scaling limit of the minimum spanning tree of the complete graph</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Annals of Probability</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6bb560a7e290357ebe1551c884f15d23"><gtr:id>6bb560a7e290357ebe1551c884f15d23</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Addario-Berry L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0091-1798</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5aa9151613c661.57923943</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E744B62B-0C7A-422E-A0BC-E1FF518490CC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Proceedings of the Twenty-Ninth Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6bb560a7e290357ebe1551c884f15d23"><gtr:id>6bb560a7e290357ebe1551c884f15d23</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Addario-Berry L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5aa91575280206.65558881</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/N004833/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9A30FDC6-AEB7-447C-A30E-0EF6BDB406FB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>33</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Logic &amp; Combinatorics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>04D8FF87-2CFC-44E7-A7DF-47E10C813E05</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>34</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical Analysis</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>62309876-5C71-411C-B1A7-1B2907AFB5A8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>33</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Statistics &amp; Appl.
