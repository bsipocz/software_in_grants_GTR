Atrial fibrillation is a condition that occurs when there is a fault in the electric activity in the heart muscle, causing the heart to beat irregularly and in an uncoordinated way. The heart of a patient with atrial fibrillation is often unable to supply enough blood to their body (a condition called ?heart failure?). In about half of all heart failure patients the condition can be explained by the heart pumping (contracting) very poorly. In the remaining patients the heart contracts reasonably well, but it does not relax properly because it is very stiff and so does not fill with sufficient blood between heart beats. These patients have a poor quality of life and a high risk of death, just as those heart failure patients who have hearts that contract poorly. However, effective treatments of patients with atrial fibrillation and heart failure despite normal heart pumping are lacking. In fact, most of the treatments developed for heart failure target those patients whose hearts contract poorly, but they are not effective in patients with normal heart contraction. So there is a clear need to find beneficial therapies for such patients. The reason why patients with atrial fibrillation tend to have stiff hearts that fill poorly and develop heart failure is not known, but high levels of aldosterone have been suggested to play an important role. Aldosterone is normally produced by the kidney, travels in the blood, and has a wide range of effects throughout the body. We think that raised aldosterone levels may explain the stiffening of the heart and its poor filling in patients with atrial fibrillation. The effects of aldosterone can be blunted with the drug spironolactone, and with this clinical trial we want to find out if giving spironolactone to patients with atrial fibrillation enhances the way their hearts relax and so increases their ability to perform exercise and improves their quality of life. The present project we will focus our attention on those patients who have atrial fibrillation, a sizable group of people in the United Kingdom. We believe our project will help us find out the best way to treat such patients.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>We hypothesise that in patients with permanent atrial fibrillation treatment with spironolactone will improve exercise tolerance as a surrogate for cardiovascular mortality/morbidity (primary outcome), and will improve quality of life and diastolic function, as well as reduce the rate of all-cause hospital admissions (secondary outcomes). In our local epidemiological screening study (SAFE), the prevalence of atrial fibrillation was 4.7% in general practice in people aged 65 years or more. A third of atrial fibrillation patients suffer symptomatic heart failure, of which most have heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. This puts patients with atrial fibrillation under very high risk of developing of heart failure irrespectively of their systolic function. The targeted patients represent about 3.0% of the UK population 65 years and older and about 1.6% of the population aged 50 years and older (based on the West Birmingham Atrial Fibrillation project). Despite preservation of ejection fraction, morbidity, quality of life and mortality in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction are generally similar impaired to those in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Furthermore, improvements in morbidity and mortality with conventional treatments used in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction have not translated to heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Hence, patients with atrial fibrillation are very commonly encountered in the NHS; they often develop heart failure despite having preserved ejection fraction and require a better understanding of the disease mechanisms and prognostically relevant therapeutic options. Left ventricular diastolic filling is often compromised due to abnormal active and/or passive relaxation (increased cardiac stiffness, may be due to changes in myocardial collagen and development of fibrosis). Aldosterone has profibrotic properties and may contribute to increased left ventricular stiffness in patients with atrial fibrillation eventually leading to heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. This study aims to determine whether the aldosterone antagonist, spironolactone improves exercise tolerance and quality of life compared to placebo (on top of the current guideline-recommended optimised medical care in both groups) in patients with permanent atrial fibrillation and preserved cardiac contractility. We will test the study hypotheses by conducting a double-blind randomised clinical trial in symptomatic participants with permanent atrial fibrillation with preserved left ventricular systolic function and normal levels of the brain natriuretic peptide to ensure homogeneity of the study population. The patients will be randomised to 2-year treatment with spironolactone vs. placebo (both added to the current optimised care). The primary outcome will be exercise tolerance (peak VO2 on cardio-pulmonary exercise testing at 2 years). Secondary outcomes will be (i) exercise tolerance measured by 6-minute walk test (a simple test of exercise performance), (ii) health-related quality of life (assessed using the validated Minnesota Living with Heart Failure [MLWHF] and EuroQol EQ-5D [EQ-5D] questionnaires self-completed by patients), and (iii) left ventricular diastolic function (E/e? on echocardiography) will be assessed at baseline and at 2 years; also (iv) rates of all-cause hospitalisations during 2-year follow-up.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100167</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>86DCC66B-9A62-4F81-B458-65E6E062762D</gtr:id><gtr:title>IMproved exercise tolerance in patients with PReserved Ejection fraction by Spironolactone on myocardial fibrosiS in Atrial Fibrillation rationale and design of the IMPRESS-AF randomised controlled trial.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>BMJ open</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/fb438b7c7949cd7e144bf15704e4ea54"><gtr:id>fb438b7c7949cd7e144bf15704e4ea54</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Shantsila E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2044-6055</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>589c54d7d65114.80440663</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MC_PC_14142</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>D4FDB752-4E9C-491F-9C63-B7D7F6F95417</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cardiovascular</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>7135039D-2DB0-4D41-87B3-FA1C8D38E133</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>6.1  Pharmaceuticals</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
