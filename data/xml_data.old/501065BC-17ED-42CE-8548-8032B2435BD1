The ultimate aim is develop and demonstrate a sensor network system* methodology which, when appropriately deployed, can contribute to scientific, economic, public policy and regulatory issues, crossing climate change, human (health) responses, as well as air quality on local and regional scales. As well as demonstrating a generic capability, the intention of this application is to address a number of specific scientific and ultimately legislative issues relevant to London Heathrow Airport. We therefore propose to deploy a high-density air quality sensor network system in and around London Heathrow Airport for an extended period. This will use state of the art low cost sensors for selected gases and for size speciated aerosols, providing an unprecedented data-set for use in a range of activities and outcomes. Air Quality and Human Health The World Health Organisation (WHO) reported in 2005 on the effects of air quality on human health and identified the relative contributions to mortality from different components of air pollution. The strongest correlations with health were found to be particulate matter (PM), followed by O3 and NO2; for example it was estimated that a reduction in the PM10 annual mean exposure to 20 ug m-3 would lead to a reduction of 22,000 attributable deaths per year in Europe. The report also identified a substantial reduction in the quality of life for millions of citizens with pre-existing respiratory and/or cardiovascular disease. However, the magnitudes of health impacts per incremental increase in pollutant levels vary between studies, in part due to imperfect knowledge of human exposure particularly within urban locations and complex, multi-source transport infrastructures. The problem lends itself to a high density, long term network of air quality monitoring to refine our understanding of the drivers of the health impacts, and better understand potential mitigation options. London Heathrow Airport There is also a strong political aspect. In 2004 the DfT established technical panels of experts to strengthen and update the assessment of air quality around Heathrow Airport in response to the Airport Transport White Paper 'The Future of Air Transport'. This identified key planning issues with respect to compliance with air quality standards. Deployment of a Sensor Network at London Heathrow Airport Miniaturised low cost measurement methodologies are now available for measurements of a range of chemical species and aerosols at concentrations observed in the urban environment, while infrastructures also exist for GPS (positioning) and GPRS (mobile phone data transfer). The proposed primary sensor network would consist of a series of ~60 sensor units combining NO, NO2, CO, O3, CO2, hydrocarbons, SO2, size speciated aerosols, temperature and RH, allowing deployment along the (14 km) perimeter of Heathrow airport at intervals of a few 100 m. Additional sites would be co-located with static AURN sites in neighbouring Boroughs, and on a campaign basis mobile sensors would be deployed. The project also aims to bring complex mathematical techniques to provide innovative ways of calibrating the sensor network, and sophisticated methods for storing and displaying the data obtained. State of the art computer modelling of pollution levels around Heathrow would also be undertaken, with the aim of producing a more refined tool for assessing the potential impacts, e.g. of airport expansion. The intention is that the sensor network would be developed during the first year of the project, deployed during the second year, with major data analysis during the third year.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-01-26</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>84067</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Alphasense</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Low cost air quality sensor development.</gtr:description><gtr:id>6383B5EC-E02B-4885-84CA-203464EB9990</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Alphasense has engaged with major organisations such as the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) who are using the Alphasense OPC-0N2 low-cost air quality sensors in networks to be deployed in numerous African cities in the coming years (see: http://www.airqualitynews.com/2015/09/02/unep-launches-low-cost-monitoring-unit/).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6734064ed45.91306547-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Alphasense have taken the prototype sensors developed at the University of Hertfordshire and re-engineered them to be suitable for mass production, using injection moulded parts and low-cost optical components. They have continued to work with Hertfordshire on the development of user software for data analysis and interpretation. They have also engaged with major organisations such as the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) who are using the Alphasense products in networks of air quality sensors to be deployed in numerous African cities in the coming years (see: http://www.airqualitynews.com/2015/09/02/unep-launches-low-cost-monitoring-unit/).</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Arising directly from research carried out in the 'High density sensor network system for air quality studies at Heathrow airport' Project (NE/1007296/1) we have designed a range of compact and ultra-compact sensors for ambient particle monitoring. Licensed to Alphasense in 2013, these devices are now being manufactured as the commercial OPC-N2 air quality PM sensor and OPC-R1 wearable air quality sensor. 

Like conventional optical particle counters, the OPC-N2 measures the light scattered by individual particles carried in a sample air stream through a laser beam. These measurements are used to determine the particle size (related to the intensity of light scattered via a theoretical calibration based on Mie scattering theory) and particle number concentration. Particle mass loading- PM2.5 or PM10, are then calculated from the particle size spectra and concentration data, assuming density and refractive index.
Most conventional OPCs employ narrow inlet tubes (and often an additional 'sheath-flow' of particle-free air) to physically constrain the airborne particles to the more uniform central part of the laser beam and ensure accurate sizing. Such instruments must incorporate both an air-pump sufficiently powerful to draw the sample aerosol through the narrow inlet tube and a particle filter upstream of the pump to avoid pump contamination and ultimate blockage. The result is a unit with relatively high current consumption and regular maintenance to replace the pump protection filter (frequent in dirty atmospheres). The OPC-N2 uses a fundamentally different approach that removes the need for both a
pump and replaceable particle filter. Instead, the patented OPC-N2 uses a combination of a custom-designed elliptical mirror and dual-element photodetector to create a 'virtual sensing zone' in free space at the centre of an open scattering chamber. The sensing zone and its surrounding space is then illuminated by a thin ribbon-shaped laser beam. Particle-laden air passing unconstrained though the scattering chamber traverses the laser beam both within and outside the sensing zone, but only those particles traversing within the sensing zone are 'validated' by the dual-element detector and counted/sized by the OPC electronics. The result is a new OPC that uses only a miniature low-power fan to generate the required particle flow through the sensing volume. This, and the removal of the requirement for a pump and particle filter extends considerably potential unattended field deployments and reduces maintenance.

The OPC-N2 classifies each particle size, at rates up to ~10,000 particle per second, adding the particle diameter to one of 16 &amp;quot;bins&amp;quot; covering the size range from ~0.38 to 17 &amp;micro;m.
The resulting particle size histograms can be evaluated over user-defined sampling times from 1 to 10 second duration, the histogram data being transmitted along with other diagnostic andenvironmental data (air temperature and air pressure) via an SPI interface to a host computer.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>86000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Research funding for 'Pocket PM' personal air quality sensor development</gtr:description><gtr:end>2018-02-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Alphasense</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>0DC2DB2D-72A6-411A-9FFC-1084EE05D780</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c2b53352aeb5.62821578</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-02-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>98000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Commercial funding</gtr:description><gtr:end>2015-11-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Alphasense</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>E4FB1ED2-5ED8-4164-AFE9-9188D201935F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546240380e9fc9.40923980</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-11-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The particle detection technology developed for the NERC Airborne Particle Classifier project is now being exploited in the NERC Network of Sensors project 'High density sensor network system for air quality studies at Heathrow airport', NE/1007296/1 (Universities of Cambridge, Hertfordshire, Manchester, Imperial, plus NPL and CERC).
