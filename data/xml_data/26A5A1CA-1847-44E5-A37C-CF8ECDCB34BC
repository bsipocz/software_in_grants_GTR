&lt;p>The research team, from The University of Sheffield, Manchester Metropolitan University, Northumbria University and The University of Bristol, will be working with organisations of/for disabled people, activists and allies to discover how disabled people with LD are participating in their communities, in public services and in social action.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The team will explore disabled people with LD?s access to social capital and networks of interdependence as well as their social emotional well-being in a context of austerity. The research will be carried out over two years through four phases:&lt;/p>

&lt;ol>
 

 &lt;li>an extended literature review and policy analysis&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>interviews with key stakeholders&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>a period of ethnographic research working with circles of support, real employment and self-advocacy organisations&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>a ?researcher in residence? phase in which a university researcher will work alongside third sector organisations in order to promote knowledge exchange and impact generation.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Dissemination and impact will be supported by the impact champions sitting on the research management group and through a series of public policy roundtables.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This proposal responds directly to issues raised by impact experts at a stakeholder workshop held in MMU in January 2011 (see 'Case for Support'). The meeting, funded by MMU, brought together researchers from three universities, The Foundation for People with Learning Disabilities, MENCAP, an Independent Living Organisation and Person Centred planning coordinators, Speak Up Self advocacy, Rotherham. All of these partners now constitute the 'Impact expert research management and advisory group' who will guide the project from start to finish and, drawing on their expertise and connections, will advise the research team to ensure that the projects findings feed into practitioner, service, policy making and civil society contexts. 

Our project interconnects perspectives from disability studies, community psychology, sociology and social policy and garners the perspectives of people with learning disabilities and civil society supporters, in order to deliver a number of impacts. We have two key questions: who will benefit from this research and how will they benefit? 

First, academics, students and practitioners in the areas of psychology, sociology, social policy and disability studies will benefit. We will draw on our track record in disseminating our findings across disciplines and international contexts (See CVs &amp;amp; End of Project Report for RES- 062-23-1138). Mid to long-term impact will be made through knowledge transfer via the presentation of our findings at conferences, events and through publication. Short term impact will include teaching of under/postgraduate students on psychology, disability studies and social work courses managed and delivered by the PI and Co-Is. (see also 'Academic Beneficiaries' section). 

Second, we have identified a number of key players in the Public Sector including practitioners, civil servants, service users, policy makers. We seek to raise public engagement with the lives of adults with learning disabilities and inform government thinking by disseminating information to key departments including: Office for Civil Society, the Office for Disability Issues. We aim to increase the effectiveness of public services through our relationships with our third sector impact partners and our Research Management Group. 

Third, we will collaborate with third sector impact partners (list available on request) who will also be beneficiaries of the research. These partners are at the forefront of engagements with civil servants and service providers and it is through their existing relationships that we will channel key findings and recommendations. They have agreed to act as project champions to share key findings and recommendations with service providers, civil servants and policy makers. These organisations have expressed commitment to draw on our findings, utilising/adapting these within their own interventions/training support packages/services delivered to professionals etc. We will provide evidence that seeks to promote the social and emotional well-being of adults with learning disabilities - thus updating their resources with empirical evidence. 

Fourth, we will collaborate with adults with learning disabilities, allies, families and professionals to promote their critical engagement with services, professional practice and enabling support mechanisms. We have devised co-operative training and impact activities (see 'Activities Schedule' attachment) that will tap into and enhance their critical capacities as key impact participants (see 'Pathways to Impact'). Operational and Organisational Change will occur in through the 'professional allied to the community' and 'impact workshop' phases of our research (see 'Case for Support'). We will seek to publicise these local changes through inter/national dissemination activities. We have costed for involvement of civil society partners as co-researchers to enhance impact.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-09-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-06-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>333056</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Buying (into) autism : the commodification of 'disability' in the academy</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A32B15FB-4F70-4DFC-869C-4B30695BF19F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Talk sparked questioning of how autism is understood as a cultural category and how the category has been commodified within the academy through the development of research centres, training programmes and published literature focused on autism.

Day one focused on the three strands of the project: circles of support; self-advocacy and employment. The day included presentations from 
? Dan Goodley (Sheffield) &amp;amp; Katherine Runswick-Cole (Manchester Metropolitan) describing key project findings;
? Jodie Bradley and Vicky Farnsworth talking about their work as self advocates at SpeakUp self-advocacy (http://speakup.org.uk); 
? Laurence Clark, Karen Flood and Vicky Hornby described their research on self-advocacy for Pathways Associates (http://blog.pathwaysassociates.co.uk ); 
? Helen Smith talking about her work for Community Circles (https://communitycirclesblog.wordpress.com); 
? Keith Bates talking about the work of the Foundation for People with Learning Disabilities moving people into employment (http://www.learningdisabilities.org.uk/help-information/learning-disability-a-z/e/employment-careers/ )
? self advocates Bob Langsford and Kevin White talking about their experience of living with austerity
The day concluded with a knowledge caf&amp;eacute; facilitated by Rebecca Lawthom (Manchester Metropolitan)

Day Two took up the theme of austerity again and began with a presentation from Dan Goodley (Sheffield) &amp;amp; Katherine Runswick-Cole (Manchester Metropolitan) talking about disability and community. In their presentation Dan and Katherine described disability's radical potential to disrupt notions of the community and, indeed, the human.
They were followed by Imogen Tyler (Lancaster) describing her current powerful research on the cultural production of stigma (https://socialabjection.wordpress.com/2014/05/12/from-the-shock-doctrine-to-the-stigma-doctrine-imogen-tyler/ ).
Next Alan Roulstone (Leeds) reflected on the 'causes' and consequences of austerity in the lives of disabled people, as well as thinking about opportunities for resistance.
Alan was followed by Jenny Fisher's (Manchester Metropolitan) presentation which focused on austerity parenting and her evaluation of the work of Home Start in Manchester (http://www.rihsc.mmu.ac.uk/projects/docs/HSMS%20report.pdf ).
After lunch, Aaron Reeves (Oxford) described his work on drawing on social policy and health economics to explore disability and the labour market (https://aaronreeves.wordpress.com ).
The day ended with a presentation by Chris Hatton (Lancaster) describing what statistics do (and don't) tell us about the lives of people with learning disabilities (http://chrishatton.blogspot.co.uk).
Thanks to the generosity and support of those attending the conference, you can follow the detail of the discussion via twitter #austerity15 and the storify is available here: ?sfy.co/b0lJU ? ?

Disabled people with learning disabilities and civil society. Her paper co-authored with Dan Goodley Becoming dishuman: re-thinking social policy through disability outlined a dishuman approach to social policy - one in which disabled people play are at the centre in shaping social policy. Drawing on examples from their research in England, they described how disabled people are troubling, re-shaping and extending what it means to be human. They concluded the paper calling for
a time when any thought about the human in social policy has in mind what disability does to it
that when thinking about the human this will always involve thinking about disability.
Paul Gibson spoke next. He set out his vision for a Centre for Disability Studies at the University of Otago, building on the work of the Donald Beasley Institute and creating a disability plan across the university. Paul called for increased representation of disabled students, staff and governors and for the lived experience of disabled people to be built into the curriculum. Focusing on a human rights approach to disability politics, Paul called for research to play a pivotal role in making disability rights real for the diversity of disabled people. He concluded by asking the audience to challenge their own prejudices, and not limit their own hopes &amp;amp; aspirations and those of others.

This activity strengthened networks in Otago and possible future research collaborations.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>55d1a7cfcb12c9.92135056</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://bigsocietydis.wordpress.com/2015/08/13/12th-august-2015-public-lecture-with-paul-gibson-disability-rights-commissioner-new-zealand/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop: The power of employers</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A5CFC706-87C4-4E7D-9DFB-67017CBA1436</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The workshop sparked discussion of how to develop supported employment at a large engineering organisation in Malaysia

Following an international satellite public engagement event in Malaysia, two of our partners from The Foundation For People with Learning Disabilities, were invited back to Malaysia to deliver further training re supported employment and transitions to adulthood for people with learning disabilities. They delivered training for the Malaysian government department for Welfare, Labour, PERMANDU (Prime Minister's Department) and Special Education as well as private sector organisations and the Japanese International Co-operation Agency. In addition, they were invited to deliver further training on supported employment to Gamuda, a large construction company employing 4,000 people, in Malaysia and to support the development of their exisiting supported employment programme for people with learning disabilities. These impacts will enhance the quality of life, and health of people with learning disabilities and enable them to participate in the work force and contribute to the economy. The team will return to Kuala Lumpur in November 2016 to assess the impact of the workshops from the previous two trips on private companies, job coaches and government policy.
 
SpeakUp Self-advocacy made a successful application (with members of the research team from MMU and Sheffield Universities) to secure a Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, Canada, Network Grant and attended a series of workshops in Toronto, Canada focusing on intimate citizenship in the lives of people with learning disabilities. Following this public engagement event in Canada, a self-advocacy organization based in Toronto is looking to develop its model of advocacy based on the research findings. SpeakUp have also submitted a proposal to Rotherham Local Authority to develop further circles of support across England. Costings for an evaluation led by MMU is included in the application. They are working alongside, Pete Crane, independent living advisor and project partner to develop further circles of support facilitated by SpeakUp. This participation in and expansion of the role of self-advocacy is a key mechanism for increasing the effectiveness of public services and policy and for promoting health and well-being for people with learning disabilities.

Community living advisors have been using research findings to change the way that advocacy is offered to families. A consortium of special schools in Sheffield is collaborating with the research team to develop circles of support for parents and disabled children in Sheffield. As above the rolling out of circles of support are a key tool for enhancing health, well-being and community engagement.

Findings are being drawn on by campaigners seeking to change the law to ensure that there is a presumption that people with LD live in their own homes and communities, this campaign is under the banner of the #LBBill. This will not only enhance the lives of people with learning disabilities but will promote community connection and inclusion.

Vicky Farnsworth, Speak Up Self-Advocacy said: quote: 'This work makes me feel proud and valued and I feel part of a group of colleagues who really want to make a lasting difference'.

Keith Bates, Foundation for People with Learning Disabilities said: 'As this research affords us a geographical snapshot combining three pieces of our work illustrated by the five participants, it has afforded an excellent chance to reflect on the impact of current government policy. This is further boosted by plans, inspired by the project, to launch a programme of conversations about employment with local family carers as they support their son or daughter in preparing for a future as an adult';

David Fiddament, Royal National Mencap, said: &amp;quot;The research has been shared with our Senior Leadership Team and will help to inform the current review of our strategic priorities. Our initial research identified that tackling inequalities (Health, Social Care; Financial) should be at the core of our new vision. Your research has identified the benefits of Community Circles, for families, individuals and organisations and will be a helpful tool in shaping our thinking.&amp;quot;

Pete Crane, independent living advisor said: 
'Already some of the work produced by Katherine and Dan (from the Big Society project) has made a real difference in the lives of real families that we have networked with';
 
We will roll out findings and recommendations of our research through our ESRC Impact Acceleration Account Grant funded website: www.humanactivism.org. 

This website provides a hub that shares news, good practice films, research findings and resources for people with learning disabilities and their allies around the themes of self-advocacy, work and independent living. Humanactivism.org will be officially launched on-line on the 5th September 2016 using the @humanactivism twitter handle, Facebook and through tapping into existing and new networks. We have planned a further launch and networking event on the 2nd December 2016 to coincide with the International Day of Disabled Persons on the 3rd December. Our launch will be broken down into three themes captured on the website:
+ Supportive work
+ Promoting self-advocacy
+ Enabling community
Each of these themes has associated:
(i) films documenting good practice and the impacts of austerity
(ii) worked case study examples of good practice
(iii) links to organisations in the UK that further promote work, self-advocacy and community living.
(iv) key summaries of related research findings associated with good practice
(v) A number of policy briefings that we are developing with the Social Science Impact and Knowledge Exchange Team at the University of Sheffield. 
Please visit www.humanactivism.org for further details. Over the academic year 2016-2017 we have put in place a number of audit trail days each week to;
(i) log and track visits;
(ii) capture responses to the site;
(iii) build up resources through appealing for crowd-sourcing;
(iv) use social media to enhance reach.
Humanactivism.org has already been used to:
+ feed into the Rethinking Care Group report led by Dr Simon Duffy which will contribute to the Parliamentary Inquiry on Adult Social Care hosted by Clive Betts MP, the Chair of the Communities &amp;amp; Local Government Committee in late 2016.
+ contribute to foundational debates of the new Learning Disability England - an alliance between people with learning disabilities and academics.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>6662D43F-55DD-4D27-98F3-54298ACEFD12</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54537f398ae1e2.01106306</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Construction,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Retail,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The findings of the research project can be broken down into three interconnected areas: theory, practice and policy. In brief, we summarise our findings under each of these headings:

Theory
Disability is a good place to start thinking about the ways in which we live together;
Thinking about disability can change the way we think about society;
Disability can change how we think about our relationships with others and to re-shape, trouble and expand on ideas of what it means to be 'human';
Disabled people's experiences and views should always be included in discussion about what a 'good society' might look like;
We live in a time when people who are 'able' to 'work hard' are valued most; we call this 'neo-liberal ableism';
It is important to question the value of what it means be a 'normal' human at the same time as recognising that disabled people are human too (DisHumanism);
We need a social policy that recognises the importance of interdependence, rather than independence;
We need to find new ways of valuing human diversity - disability is a good place to start.

Practice
Disabled people should not be 'left out in the cold' in social policy or society;
Disability is a good place to start thinking about how we might labour (work) differently and think again about what work means;
Self-advocacy enables people to fight for their rights and to speak up.
Job coaching can work well to support people into employment;
Social enterprises can also create employment opportunities for people with learning disabilities;
Business circles of support can help people become self-employed;
Circles offer a powerful form of 'co-produced' advocacy;
Information about circles should be shared widely;
We need to act now to expose and challenge widespread disabling attitudes and practices in the lives of disabled people with learning disabilities.

Policy
It is time to end the institutionalisation of disabled people; assessment and treatment units should be closed to new admissions with a view to closing all such provision within the National Health Service.
Every disabled person with a personal budget should be offered access advocacy, either by an independent advocate or through co-produced advocacy in the form of a circle of support. 
 There should be increased investment in proven mechanisms for supporting people with a learning disability into work (e.g. supported internships, social enterprise, self-employment - supported by business circles).
There should be increased investment for local self-advocacy groups for people with learning disabilities and that these are not replaced by large, generic advocacy organisations.

We have captured these and other key findings through the writing of accessible Summary Cards and Policy Briefings documents which can be downloaded as pdfs from our project website https://bigsocietydis.wordpress.com. Each of the cards accessibly summarises an academic output, blog or presentation.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We expect that the findings re: good practice evidence base for moving people with learning disabilities into employment will be taken forward by the Departments for Welfare, Labour, PERMANDU (Prime Minister's Office) and Special Education in Malaysia, as well as Gamuda, a Malaysian construction company.

We expect that the findings re: circles of support as a form of co-produced self advocacy will be taken up by third sector; local authority social care services, by activists and allies to disabled people. Findings are being drawn on by campaigners seeking to change the law to ensure that there is a presumption that people with LD live in their own homes and communities, this campaign is under the banner of the #LBBill. We expect that the model of circles of support will also be developed by a consortium of special schools in Sheffield.

We expect that the findings re: self-advocacy will be taken up by self-advocates in Canada to develop models of paid advocacy. We also expect that the findings will become part of a wider movement to secure the future of self-advocacy in England working in partnership with Pathways Associates, Mencap, Housing and Support Alliance, Foundation for People with Learning Disabilities and the Learning Disability Alliance - all of whom we have engaged with as part of the research.

Our expectations in relation to the above-mentioned pathways to impact will be met through the development of our ESRC Impact Acceleration Account grant funded website (working title www.humanstoo.com) which will produce resources for people with learning disabilities and their allies around the themes of self-advocacy, work and independent living (drawing on findings and recommendations from our research).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>21B3E6C4-2E3B-4E17-A93B-15E0BA2195BF</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54537bcce4f9a3.95735022</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Education,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Retail</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://bigsocietydis.wordpress.com</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>16F113EB-65FB-4FAD-9121-3A7D506C8260</gtr:id><gtr:title>DisPovertyPorn:
