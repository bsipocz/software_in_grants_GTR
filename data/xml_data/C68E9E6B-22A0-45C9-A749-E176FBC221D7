This application recognises that China has been a remarkable economic success story but the country also faces new challenges as its economy enters a more mature phase. In particular, it needs to avoid the 'middle income trap' i.e. where a country has costs that are now too high to compete with low-income countries but where productivity does not match those in high-income countries. 
There are economies in Asia including Singapore and Hong Kong SAR that have emerged successfully from middle income status. Both these economies are built on UK law and are renowned for the quality of their legal infrastructure in supporting development of the financial system. The application suggests how China might also benefit from the UK experience in building its legal infrastructure. But the application recognises China's singular journey and avoids simplistic conclusions that certain consequences will inevitably follow form certain formal changes. It recognises the need for a continuous process of adaptation and development; learning appropriately from experience and responding sensitively to local conditions. The application demonstrates in particular how legal reforms can support economic growth through 
- enhancing the protections available to minority investors
- supporting the availability of credit and contributing to lower-cost credit
- supporting the restructuring of ailing businesses.

In these areas we seek to provide options for enhancing and reforming the legal and financial system in China that are based upon the UK and other experience. We acknowledge that there are choices to be made between means and ends and that the relationship between means and ends is contingent and uncertain. 
The data we rely on will come principally from the World Bank Doing Business (DB) reports and rankings which are grounded on the notion that smarter business regulation promotes economic growth.
The DB rankings have been issued annually since 2004 and the 2016 rankings includes 11 sets of indicators for 189 economies. Each economy is ranked on the individual indicators and also in an overall table. Currently, the UK is 6th in this table and China 84th but Singapore is 1st and Hong SAR is 5th which shows that it is possible for Asian economies to rank highly.
In our project, we will explore deep into the detail underlying the Protecting Minority Investors, Getting credit and Resolving Insolvency indicators. These 3 indicators appear particularly pertinent to the development of a mature financial system and in relation to them all China ranks far below the UK. On protecting investors, China is ranked as 134th whereas the UK is 4th. We show how the gap can be bridged and how China can learn from the UK experience by examining critically how the UK has protected minority investors and ascertaining what measures of protection might work most effectively in Chinese conditions. 
Our approach takes the relevant DB rankings as a guide but subjects them to critical scrutiny and engaging systematically with the methodology underpinning the rankings; addressing the robustness of this methodology and considering alternative approaches. For instance, we will test the robustness and limitations of the DB 'resolving insolvency' data on China using Jiande Municipal People's Court in Zhejiang Province as a case study. This makes the process of data collection and analysis more manageable. 20 interviews with creditors and practitioners will be undertaken in Zhejiang Province and data on business closures from the local branches of the China Business Registration Authorities and the China Pension Management Authorities will also be collected.
We will also use econometric analyses based on detailed micro data from other data sources</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project aims to influence policy-makers, and guide investors, companies and practitioners on the legal reforms necessary to provide China with a more competitive financial and legal system with increased opportunities for all. it will highlight in particular the reforms that are needed in respect of enhancing the protections available to minority investors; supporting the availability of credit including lower-cost credit; and facilitating the restructuring of ailing businesses. It also aims to influence the World Bank in reviewing its Doing Business data. The project will do this by leveraging the combined and complementary disciplinary and cross country strengths of the Centre for Business Law and Practice (CBLP) at the School of Law, University of Leeds and the Management department at the University of Wuhan. It will utilise their different networks and bring these together to promote the development of innovative new policy ideas and to facilitate policy formation. We set out below these specific policy impacts

1. Policy-Makers/Regulators/Government
A strong Chinese financial and legal system is essential not only for a strong Chinese economy but also, given the size of China's economy, for a sound global economy. Weaknesses in the system can erode trust, discourage investment, including inward investment into China. Chinese investment into the UK may also be impacted if weaknesses in the financial and legal system impact on the Chinese economy. By examining whether there are measures that may enhance the protections available to minority investors, support the availability of credit and lower-cost credit and support the restructuring of ailing businesses, the project will assist Chinese policy-makers in designing measures that may address these objectives. It also aims to assist Hong Kong and international regulators in better understanding and assessing the risks and benefits posed by Chinese companies for investors.
2. The World Bank
The study includes a visit to the World Bank and will assist it in assessing the reliability of its Doing Business data in relation to China and where necessary adjusting this information. This will in turn assist those who rely on such data for investment and policy decisions.
3. Investors-Shareholders and Creditors
The project will assist investors both outside and within China, such as the China Investment Corporation who are seeking to make investment decisions in Chinese companies, by providing them with a more detailed understanding of the risks involved and the protections available and any reforms they may wish to press for. 
4. Companies
The project will benefit Chinese companies seeking to attract investment by providing them with data on the perceived weaknesses, if any, of the Chinese financial and legal system and provide data on what private measures that they be able to take to address these and attract investment. 
5. Professional and Practitioner Groups
The project will inform the practice of practitioners regarding the likely outcomes of litigating on behalf of minority shareholders and creditors and what reforms may be required. This may result in strengthening of protection for investors insofar as it facilitates more successful or effective litigation. 

The above groups will be reached in the following ways:
Groups 1 and 2: Targeted briefing papers, invitation to participate at conferences, workshops, visits to key policy-makers to present research. Their feedback will be sought on design of project as it progresses and they will be briefed on progress. The Final report will be directly disseminated to them.
Groups 3-5: Invitation to conferences, workshops at which social media communications will be flagged up, dissemination through the partner networks. Their feedback and views will be sought eg through comments on blogs, email and in person. 

Advisory Board and policy makers will be contacted regularly for feedback on project findings.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-02-12</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-02-13</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>325177</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/P004040/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4511FB20-8392-418E-809D-7701FACC03C9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Law &amp; legal studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B6F2E89E-46FA-4084-B88C-26D28FC989C6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Common Law inc.
