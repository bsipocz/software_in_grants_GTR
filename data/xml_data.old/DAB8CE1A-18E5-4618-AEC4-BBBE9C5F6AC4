The government and the WHO continue to highlight the development of new antibiotics as an area of high priority. Many antimicrobial natural products contain functionalised decalin ring systems. These structural units are synthetically non-trivial to construct and oftentimes require many synthetic steps. It is proposed here that recent advances in the synthesis and characterisation of dendralenes may enable the development of a highly efficient and general transmissive Diels-Alder approach to a large range of functionalised decalin ring systems present in many natural products. If successful, such a route could lead to breakthroughs in the synthesis and supply of these scarce molecules for full biological evaluation. 
This proposal will build on our previous EPSRC-funded work in the area antimicrobial natural product synthesis and the use of Diels-Alder reactions for the synthesis of biologically active natural products by allowing the PI to spend a period of time embedded in the Sherburn group to gain first-hand experience in the synthesis and handling of dendralenes. This will enable a full proposal for the use of dendralenes in the synthesis of decalin-containing antimicrobials to be developed.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this proposal and how will they benefit? 
The primary beneficiaries of this overseas travel grant application will be the PI and his research group. They will benefit through the acquisition of knowledge and skills obtained in the lab of an internationally recognised leader in the field of dendralene chemistry. The PI and his group will then be able to apply this knowledge and skills in the investigation of the transmissive Diels-Alder reaction of dendralenes as a general strategy for the synthesis of diverse biologically active decalin-containing natural products.

What will be done to ensure that they benefit from this research?
We will actively seek to maximise the opportunities that the award of this overseas travel grant will provide. The PI will spend 1 month in the lab of Prof. Sherburn and will aim to establish an on-going collaboration between their groups. The PI will be embedded within the Sherburn group, learning the techniques required to conduct dendralene chemistry back in the UK. Upon his return to the UK the PI will train members of his research group in dendralene chemistry. The PI will also develop a full EPSRC research proposal on the area of the transmissive Diels-Alder reaction of dendralenes as a general strategy for the synthesis of diverse biologically active decalin-containing natural products. This proposal will be informed by the discussion engaged in with Prof. Sherburn while visiting his group. Furthermore continued contact (skype) and exchanges of researchers between the groups will be sought and actively pursued over the coming years in order to build a strong and lasting collaboration. We will endeavour to obtain funding (Royal Society, University, etc.,) for a return visit of Prof. Sherburn to York in the 12 months following the PI's visit to ANU.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>11681</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R024758/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>60EBB420-734E-4DB5-B0F2-65A1115A27F8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical synthesis</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>454398F2-57A6-4959-8845-0F248CF4D5C4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical Synthetic Methodology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
