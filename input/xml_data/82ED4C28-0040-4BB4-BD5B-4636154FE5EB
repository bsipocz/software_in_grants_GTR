Atmospheric Temperature and Pressure</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>NE/I024852/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Weather and climate prediction are inevitably limited by incomplete knowledge of the Earth system and its external influences. One under-explored and consequently controversial area of research is the meteorological influence of the Sun through processes other than direct radiation, such as variations in the Earth-ionosphere electric potential in the global electric circuit driven by solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere interactions. Previous work has suggested that a relationship exists (often termed the Mansurov effect) but previous correlations have been indirect and the effects most likely underestimated. BAS has considerable expertise in the measurement and understanding of the ionospheric electric potential pattern using the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN). We propose to use 15 years of SuperDARN electric potential measurements from both the northern and southern hemispheres to conduct the most comprehensive analysis to date of the relationship between the ionospheric electric potential and atmospheric temperature and pressure. If this analysis confirms a significant relationship then its consequences for weather and climate will be assessed by studying the climatologies for different ionospheric potential states and evaluating the possible effects on atmospheric modes like the North Atlantic Oscillation.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Scientific mechanisms are often viewed as controversial, or not important, because they have been poorly measured or are poorly understood. Only with a full understanding of such mechanisms can their scientific, economic, and societal impact be properly assessed. The effect of solar variability on climate is presently a very high-profile area of scientific research with sceptics of anthropogenic climate change often exploiting the poorly-understood nature of many of these mechanisms to support the view that natural variability can explain the unprecedented warming of the last 50 years. It is only by having a clear quantitative understanding of all the mechanisms by which solar variability affects the Earth's climate that some closure can be brought to these arguments, and the uncertainty in climate change scenarios can be reduced.

There is presently a low level of understanding of the solar influence on weather and climate. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC 2007) &amp;quot;More research on climate is needed before the magnitude of solar effects on climate can be stated with certainty&amp;quot;. The IPCC focuses on the effects of changing solar irradiance. It is now well known that total solar irradiance, which provides heat input to the lower atmosphere and oceans, varies by ~0.1% through the solar cycle. In addition, ultraviolet irradiance, which affects stratospheric ozone production and temperature, varies by a few percent. The effects of these irradiance mechanisms on climate have now been well modelled and it has been shown that they can result in significant climate effects if present over a long time interval or if there are non-linear responses that give amplifying feedbacks. The IPCC also note that there might be other mechanisms though which the Sun can couple to the Earth's climate. These include such mechanisms as the effect of energetic particle precipitation on stratospheric ozone, and the effect of solar-driven variations in the global electric circuit (GEC) on lower atmosphere temperature and pressure. NERC also identifies, within its climate theme, that there is a need to &amp;quot;improve understanding of natural variability and the link with climate change&amp;quot;, and that there is a need for &amp;quot;the inclusion of a wider range of processes&amp;quot; in climate models.

This proposal aims to provide a quantitative measure of the influence of solar variability on weather and climate, through variations in the ionospheric electric potential and consequently in the global electric circuit. Measurements and monitoring of the global electric circuit have been neglected in recent decades, which has prevented the testing of the basic hypotheses except for some limited regions or by using historical data.

Hence, we envisage the impacts of the project to be:

(i) Quantitative measures of the effect of variations in the ionospheric electric potential on atmospheric pressure and temperature and atmospheric pressure systems like the North Atlantic Oscillation that will provide input for weather and climate modellers at institutes such as the Met Office or ECMWF.

(ii) Raising the profile of the GEC (and its possible effects on weather and climate) within the climate and general science community.

(iii) Ultimately, a reduction in the uncertainty in climate change scenarios (e.g., input to IPCC).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>370875</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Australian Antarctic Division</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Australia, Commonwealth of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Gary Burns</gtr:description><gtr:id>EA06D1BF-01F6-4177-BE2C-931F17BDA089</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Multi-disciplinary: atmospheric electricity; meteorology; space physics</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545ce3ab4d3296.79050930-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>I was provided with a four-year dataset of the size of the thunderstorm generator anomaly derived from Antarctic electric field mill data which is very difficult to collect</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>I conducted a study on the effect of the thunderstorm generator on global atmospheric pressure</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Reading</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Reading University</gtr:description><gtr:id>197AB1C4-37B5-4F9B-8FFE-216CFC516C2D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Multi-disciplinary: Space Physics and Meteorology</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545ce0daafcab5.17018828-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>I have been provided with data and expertise for a new study</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>None as yet</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>International Space Science Institute (ISSI)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Switzerland, Swiss Confederation</gtr:country><gtr:description>ISSI team</gtr:description><gtr:id>E51255F2-ACC0-4911-B2B7-4A54E65A6A3C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Multi-disciplinary.

The existence of a surface meteorological response in the polar regions to fluctuations in the dawn-dusk component of the interplanetary magnetic field is well established, but meteorological effects resulting from fluctuations in the solar wind are presently poorly represented in weather and climate models. There is evidence that suggests that this Sun-weather connection occurs through coupling of the interplanetary magnetic field with the electric field of the ionosphere (the ionised upper atmosphere), and that this in turn affects meteorology through the global atmospheric electric circuit that exists between the Earth's surface and the ionosphere. Consequently it has previously been assumed that this effect maximises at high latitudes and is negligible at low and mid latitudes, because the perturbation of the global atmospheric electric field by the interplanetary magnetic field is concentrated in the polar regions. Previous work has only investigated polar surface effects, which has limited our insight into mechanisms. We have therefore investigated the magnitude of the surface effect worldwide, and the height-dependence of the polar effect from the surface to the mid-stratosphere, using global reanalysis data. The most significant achievements of the project are that we have discovered that (i) the interplanetary magnetic field influences mid-latitude surface atmospheric pressure as a consequence of its effect on polar pressure and (ii) the polar mechanism involved operates in the lower troposphere, with resulting perturbations propagating upwards to the tropopause. These two discoveries were published in high-impact journals and both were chosen as journal highlights. As a consequence project team members have been invited onto international teams examining and reviewing the question of the effect of solar variability on weather and climate, and to give keynote talks at conferences. The project identified a previously unrecognised difference between the mid-latitude mean surface pressure during intervals characterised by strong duskward and dawnward-directed interplanetary magnetic fields, and that this difference possesses a statistically-significant wave structure similar in location and form to atmospheric Rossby waves. The amplitude of the effect is comparable to typical initial analysis uncertainties in ensemble numerical weather prediction. Thus this relatively localised and small-amplitude solar influence on the upper atmosphere could have an important effect, via the nonlinear evolution of atmospheric dynamics, on critical processes such as European climate and the breakup of Arctic sea ice. This project has also provided insight into the mechanism. The increase in time lag of the effect with increasing altitude in the polar troposphere and its confinement to the troposphere is consistent with the upward propagation by conventional atmospheric processes of a solar wind-induced variability originating in the lower troposphere. For instance, it is consistent with the effects of atmospheric current variability on tropospheric cloud microphysics put forward by Brian Tinsley and others.
