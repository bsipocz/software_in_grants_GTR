Yet, as is the case with any contested issue, the definition of what this referendum is about will be negotiated between political and social groups, debated in the media and deliberated by voters before making their decision. Is the referendum a competition between two opponents fighting for the vote? Is it a matter of identity (shared or distinctive)? Is it a matter of economic survival and growth?

This research will examine how the 2014 Scottish independence referendum campaign is framed in the news coverage of the two main television channels catering for audiences in Central Scotland, BBC Scotland and STV. The importance of television as a trusted source of news on political issues is constantly reaffirmed by surveys (Ofcom, 2013, Eurobarometer, 2012) and therefore what television says about a major political event is significant.

The study will focus on Scottish news and current affairs coverage referring to the referendum in the final month of the campaign, create an original set of frames emerging from the coverage and measure which of them were more prominent. The project will also use structured interviews with political editors, heads of news and current affairs, political and civil society actors, to discuss how these representations were shaped in the interaction between journalists, media organisations and their sources. 

The project will contribute to public analysis of the news coverage of the referendum in the aftermath of the event and create opportunities for stakeholders to discuss how broadcasting contributes to the democratic process, through the way it reports on campaigns. Key stakeholder groups, such as the Electoral Commission, the Hansard Society, the Voice of the Listener and Viewer and the BBC Audience Council will be invited to participate in these. At an international level, it will inform debate and policy making on referenda not only on autonomy issues, but also on other national matters (for instance the 2017 EU membership vote in the UK). European election observers, leading researchers specializing in the study of elections and referenda and the European Broadcasting Union will be kept up-to-date with findings and they will also be invited to participate in dissemination events.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research will benefit stakeholders in Scotland, the UK and beyond. The PI has already approached a number of key stakeholders and initial responses have indicated that the project will be a relevant, interesting and timely undertaking.

Stakeholders include organisations promoting awareness of the democratic process, and particularly elections and referenda, such as the Hansard Society and the Electoral Commission; organisations that protect the interests of broadcast audiences, such as the BBC Audience Council Scotland, VLV (Voice of the Listener and the Viewer) Scotland, and the European Alliance of Listeners' and Viewers' Associations (EURALVA); the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), the world's foremost alliance of public service media organizations, defending the interests of public service media; the two broadcasting organisations investigated and the rest of the Scottish media industry; as well as Scottish political parties involved in the campaign.

For the broadcasters themselves, the research will provide an independent assessment of their performance that will contribute to their thinking around editorial policy in future political campaigns. For political actors and for UK electoral bodies, the project will deliver insights into how media interpretations of referenda are formed and affected by political communication - with another referendum planned for 2017 (on the UK's membership of the EU) these insights will be of particular relevance for their strategies. Organisations that are concerned with the interests of broadcasting audiences and with public service broadcasting in the UK and in Europe will benefit from an assessment of how the specific broadcasters served their democratic purpose in this case and from a broader understanding of the role of broadcasting in referenda, which will inform their positions on this crucial matter. More generally the project's social impact will be to provide all relevant stakeholders with input that will allow them to ensure that broadcasting remains in the service of democratic ideals.

To the best of my knowledge, this research is one of very few UK studies undertaking a systematic analysis of how broadcast media help shape our understanding of key political and constitutional referenda. This research will thus constitute an important development in knowledge and will interact fully with relevant national and international programmes and organisations identified in this application, including projects on the Scottish referendum already funded by the ESRC. My previous experience demonstrates that journalists, media professionals and policy makers use research findings as a means of independent evaluation of their efforts and a contribution to their ongoing development of ideas.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>106796</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Department of Political Sciences</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Italy, Italian Republic</gtr:country><gtr:description>Luiss University</gtr:description><gtr:id>66050A14-5016-4935-9A92-1148B7B7A991</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited presentation at the International Conference 'Media Politics and Democracy.

A presentation of findings from the research was followed by a one-hour roundtable discussion, during which delegates engaged with the issues arising from the findings. Delegates discussed the significance of the findings for democratic representation and the role of broadcasting in explaining what a referendum is about. A report from the event was sent to delegates as well as to those who weren't able to attend, including the Electoral Commission and the European Broadcasting Union. 

The seminar led to further liaising with delegates including their participation in the project conference in September 2015. It was also followed up with one-to-one meetings with broadcasters in 2016 to discuss how findings may impact on their coverage of future referenda.

Key industry figures (Ken MacQuarrie, Controller of BBC Scotland; Ian Small, Head of Policy and Public Affairs, BBC Scotland; Bobby Hain, Director of Channels at STV; Bill Matthews, BBC Trustee for Scotland; Allan Jack, BBC Trust Chief Adviser in Scotland; Alan Stewart, Regulatory Affairs Manager at Ofcom Scotland; Liz Leonard and Philip Schlesinger, Ofcom Scotland Advisory Committee members; Lynn Whitaker, Director of VLV Scotland; Blair Jenkins, Chief Executive of Yes Scotland, among others) attended events organised to discuss findings of the research. These were:
- an industry seminar and debate, in Glasgow (Lighthouse) on 17 June 2015.
- a conference at Stirling University on 18 September 2015.
- a talk at the 'Scotland, PSB and the Broadcasting Landscape' event organised by the RSA at Glasgow University on 13 January 2016.

As a result of these events, findings from the research fed into consultation submissions, particularly by the BBC Audience Council, and helped shape policy on editorial standards. The debates at these events and the report I provided to delegates fed into BBC Audience Council Scotland's submission to the BBC Charter Review consultation, where the research was directly cited (see influence on policy, citation in policy documents). Also, as a result of these events, I was invited to a consultation meeting with the BBC Audience Council Scotland on 8 April 2016 (see influence on policy, participation in advisory committee) where I provided further details of my findings to Council members.

A further submission by the Council, to the consultation for the review of BBC editorial guidelines for the 2016 EU referendum, echoes findings from the research and, although it does not directly reference it, its proposal that &amp;quot;coverage should go beyond 'impartial and independent reporting of the campaign' to reflect as wide a range of views as possible [] the BBC news agenda should draw from sources beyond the official in/out campaigns&amp;quot; reflects key findings from my research suggesting that the Scottish referendum coverage was heavily reliant on the two campaigns. This point was taken on in the revised BBC guidelines, which state that: &amp;quot;there may be circumstances in which other voices, beyond the formal representatives, are relevant to the arguments: these too should be weighed in terms of the broad balance. The designated Campaign Groups - whilst offering spokespeople to programme-makers and other content producers - cannot dictate who should or who should not appear on BBC output&amp;quot; (see influence on policy, participation in advisory committee). This suggests an indirect influence of the findings. As the BBC Trust's Chief Adviser in Scotland confirmed in an email, &amp;quot;the ideas raised in your research did enter into the debate on broadcasting&amp;quot;.
 
I also gave written evidence to the House of Commons Culture Media and Sport Select Committee consultation on the BBC and Broadcasting in Scotland on 19 July 2016 (see influence on policy, evidence to government review), which was part of their broader BBC Charter Review Inquiry. 

Impact on editorial decision-making: Following the engagement events discussed above, I was invited to one-to-one meetings with BBC Scotland's Head of Editorial Standards and Compliance, as well as the Head of Public Policy and Public Affairs, on 9 March 2016 at the BBC Scotland headquarters in Glasgow. During these meetings the broadcasters committed to feed the findings into their decision-making process in the coverage of future referendums. The Head of Public Policy confirmed in a subsequent letter that the reseach &amp;quot;will certainly help to inform decision-making in respect of how we approach all such future events&amp;quot;, and that he would &amp;quot;make sure that the document [report prepared for broadcasters] is made available widely among staff&amp;quot;. 

I later recorded and analysed BBC Scotland's Reporting Scotland daily bulletin in the final month of the 2016 EU referendum campaign (23.5-23.6.16) and found much less focus on the strategic game of the campaign, compared to the final month of Scottish referendum (see influence on policy, influence on training of practitioners). This may suggest that issues raised by the research were taken into consideration.

Ofcom Scotland also commented in writing that the study and the debate it generated at events were of &amp;quot;great interest&amp;quot; to them and that they had shared the research with Ofcom Content Standards in London to brief them on the findings. 

Contribution to debate among the public: Apart from the broadcasters and regulators, the research also generated debate among members of the wider public. I presented research findings at the 2015 Festival of Politics (16 August 2015) in the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh. For this I put together a panel with well known political correspondents Sarah Smith (BBC) and Bernard Ponsonby (STV). The panel was the best-attended event in the Festival after the Parliament's Chamber events, with 125 members of the public attending, and generated considerable debate in the room and on Twitter. This was an interactive opportunity for members of the public and the broadcasters to engage directly with the findings of the study and exchange views about it. An exhibition that visualized findings from the research at Stirling University (7/9-16/11/2015) was seen by over 5000 visitors (see engagement activities). Both these events contributed to reflective public debate around the referendum, which was one of the project's aims.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>6D503D3C-7D75-4435-A4A3-4D6D13AF5A8C</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56e14c00c764e7.50788452</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The research discovered that the 2014 Scottish referendum was represented in television coverage in two main ways: as a strategic competition or game between the two official Yes and No campaigns (game frame); and as a decision about different policy areas, such as economic policy, public services, welfare, international policy, defence, etc (policy frame). In the final month of the campaign on BBC Scotland and STV, the game frame was the most prominent way of representing the referendum (present in 70% and 69% of the coverage respectively) followed by the policy frame (in 68% and 62% of each channel's coverage). These frames have also been discussed in the context of referendums and elections in other countries. A set of new, original frames were additionally identified in the coverage of the Scottish referendum: the referendum was also represented as being about national identity; democratic self-determination; a divorce; social justice; constitutional change within the UK; an achievement for democracy; a source of national division. However, none of these different interpretations appeared in more than 23% of either channel's coverage. Taken all together this later group of frames that had to do with abstract values appeared in 45% (BBC Scotland) and 37% (STV) of the final month's coverage, far behind the game and the pragmatic policy frames.

The research also identified a series of factors contributing to this framing of the referendum through in-depth interviews with the BBC Scotland and STV news teams, political communicators working for the two sides of the referendum argument, and neutral civil society organisations. First it found that the policy frame appeared so prominently in the coverage because it was promoted by both Yes and No political actors. The heavy day-to-day reliance of broadcasters on the campaigns for their referendum stories, as well as the wide-spread view among journalists that it was not for broadcasters to determine what the referendum was about but for their sources, both are connected with the prominence of the policy frame. Second, the research found that the prominence of the game frame is connected with broadcasters' understanding of impartiality as giving opposing sides equal opportunity to respond to what their opponents said, which practically translates into countering each claim from one side with a claim from the other. It also found that some broadcasters perceive game-framed coverage such as televised debates and clashes between politicians as contributing to public debate and attracting audiences.

Based on these insights and on insights from studies on other referendums, this research developed a frame-building schema to account for the framing of referendum campaigns combining different factors, which may contribute to broadcasters reproducing political campaigns' frames and also 'reframing' them by presenting their opposing proposals through a game or competition narrative (in Dekavalla, forthcoming monograph). The schema can be useful in explaining the framing of referendums in other Western contexts too.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Non-academic uses: Broadcasters, regulators and policy makers engaged with the findings and committed to use them in their decision-making in subsequent referendums. 

As set out in the grant objectives, the research contributed to a better understanding of the dynamics of political communication in referendums and provided Scottish broadcasters with an external assessment of their referendum coverage and an insightful view on journalistic practice to inform review of their performance. 

It fed into editorial decision-making at BBC Scotland during their coverage of the 2016 EU referendum. In one-to-one meetings the PI had with the Head of Editorial Standards and the Head of Public Policy at BBC Scotland in March 2016, they said that the findings were shared internally and were useful in reflecting on and reviewing their practice. BBC Scotland's Head of Policy and Corporate Affairs stated in a subsequent letter to the PI that the research &amp;quot;will certainly help to inform decision-making in respect of how we approach all such future events&amp;quot;.

Additionally, the findings of this research contributed to policy reviews. Through a series of engagement activities (see narrative impact), the research informed debate among Scottish broadcasters and television regulators, about the framing of referendum campaigns on television. Following these engagement events, the PI was invited to a consultation meeting with the BBC Audience Council Scotland, the advisory body of the BBC Trust, while her research was referenced by the Council in their submission to the 2016 BBC Charter Review consultation. Ofcom Scotland also confirmed that the findings were shared internally and would be taken into consideration. The research additionally informed the PI's submission of evidence to the House of Commons Culture Media and Sport Committee 2016 consultation on the BBC and Broadcasting in Scotland. 

Academic uses: Findings can be taken forward by other researchers by comparative analysis of new case studies using the insights developed in this study regarding the aspects affecting media frame building in referendums.

The research was presented at a range of international academic conferences in politics and communication studies, thus contributing to interdisciplinary debate among academic audiences on the framing of referendums: MeCCSA 2017; IPSA 2016; ECREA 2016; PSA 2016; Media, Politics and Democracy: A Challenging Topic for Social Sciences Luiss University 2015; The 2014 Scottish Independence Referendum in the Media Stirling University 2015; Media Framing and Metaphor Use in Conflict Universitat Rovira i Virgili 2015; and at the Amsterdam School of Communication Research (ASCoR) research seminar.

The interdisciplinary contribution of the research is also reflected in publications in both journalism and politics academic outlets (3 journal articles, the third currently under review, and a forthcoming monograph).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D6B10B64-EDDE-4267-81B2-F833DA14E47B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e159bba683d9.36216712</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Citation in BBC Audience Council Scotland submission to the BBC Charter Review Consultation</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CDA40FED-3776-4DD8-981E-76512E76A661</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56df1f80381785.60588772</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/acs/acscharterresponse.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Evidence to the House of Commons, Culture Media and Sport Committee inquiry on the BBC Charter Review (consultation on the BBC and broadcasting in Scotland).</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C9E7797C-93BD-472A-B035-A0C574D95D6A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58879fe0d9c460.94873735</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/culture-media-and-sport-committee/bbc-charter-review/written/35151.html</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Use of findings to inform coverage of 2016 EU referendum at BBC Scotland</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>389F8A80-BEED-4E22-A282-CA78F2A50BE8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>BBC Scotland used the findings of the research in their decision making while covering the 2016 EU referendum.

Indeed the findings appear to have been taken on board in the coverage of the 2016 EU referendum. Whereas in BBC Scotland's coverage of the 2014 Scottish referendum the referendum was primarily represented as a strategic game between the political campaigns (in 70% of the final month's coverage), in the coverage of the 2016 EU referendum on BBC Reporting Scotland the game frame was only present in 31% of news items (in the final month). The organisation appears to have taken on board the findings of the research from the 2014 referendum and focused instead on the impact of the EU referendum decision on different policy areas in Scotland (the policy frame was present in 86.2% of the final months' coverage on BBC Reporting Scotland).
