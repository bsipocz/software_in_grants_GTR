I presented a talk titled &amp;quot;New Drugs for Mental Illness, where will they come from&amp;quot; to approx 50 psychiatrists twice (Coventry and Cardiff) and showed latest findings with AUT00206 and related projects. These were both funded by the Pharmaceutical Industry. I spoke at the British Pharmacological Society Meeting (BPS, 2015) (approx 80 pharmacologists) and my colleague Mike Harte spoke at the British Association for Psychopharmacology annual scientific meeting and informed approx 60 psychiatrists, scientists and health care professionals about our work with AUT00206. I have spoken to pharmacists and undergraduate and postgraduate students about this work in internal talks at the University of Manchester and also to students at the University of Huddersfield. I have also presented this work to scientists at Boehringer Ingelheim.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b816b194a154.65941872</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015,2016,2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>24000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Autifony have supported an undergraduate placement student form the University Bath</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-08-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Autifony Therapeutics</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>1836FB19-E92F-4341-846D-B72BBBF85BD0</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58b80b78450038.57726560</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-08-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>214000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Clinical Development of AUT00206 for the treatment of schizophrenia</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-06-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Innovate UK</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>MC_PC_15006</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>27459866-D8DC-47DE-8FE4-DC6AE45A7B56</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c6628df2caa8.05868947</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-06-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>The Social Discrimination task is based on the natural preference of rats to investigate unfamiliar objects or animals (Ennoceur and Delacour, 1988) in the presence of normal levels of selective attention. Terranova and Scatton (Terranova and Scatton et al. 2005) and Harich and Bespalov (Harich and Bespalov 2007) performed the Social Discrimination task in male Wistar Han rats, by introducing an adult rat in the test box with a first juvenile rat for a P1 time of 30 min. At the end of P1, a second unfamiliar juvenile rat was introduced in the test box for a P2 time of 5 min. The second juvenile rat represents the novel stimulus. A deficit in selective attention is characterized by the inability to discriminate relevant from irrelevant stimuli. Terranova and Scatton and Harich and Bespalov showed that rats administered phencyclidine (PCP) at the neonatal stage, showed a deficit in selective attention in the Social Discrimination task .</gtr:description><gtr:id>9F9B2D90-180B-471A-B8D6-E55370836FF2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We identified that female Lister Hooded rats, but not Wistars, show aggression towards the juvenile and are therefore unsuitable for this test.
