It has also been established that if an observer sees a face gazing in a particular direction, their attention will shift to the location being gazed at. These effects are likely to facilitate social interaction, but to what extent are such deployments of attention under the observer's control? Some have argued that they occur like a reflex, and cannot be suppressed (eg, Theeuwes &amp;amp; Van der Stigchel, 2006). It does seem that these biases do not represent a deliberate strategy, but some evidence suggests that a form of unconscious control may operate (eg, Ristic &amp;amp; Kingstone, 2005). Control processes that direct the operation of other lower-level cognitive systems are often referred to as ?executive functions?. &lt;/p> 
&lt;p>This research project will investigate the role of executive functions in attentional biases towards faces and eye-gaze. It will use dual-task methodology, where the impact on one task of doing another task at the same time is examined. The research will seek to explain how people exert control over their responses to faces and eye-gaze, thereby increasing our understanding of social cognitive processes in human interaction.&lt;/p>

Observers will attend to a face preferentially above other types of object that may appear in competition with it. However, this bias may not arise (or may take longer to arise) when observers are maintaining verbal information in working memory. 



Nevertheless, visual attention biases towards faces and eye gaze are persistent, and appear not to be readily modulated by the maintenance and manipulation of information in working memory.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>One aim of this Fellowship was to test a number of different combinations of primary (social attention) tasks and secondary (working memory) tasks. The pre-load (digit rehearsal) procedure was found to combine well with the primary tasks and variations of this, perhaps using visuo-spatial information instead of verbal information, would be a useful direction for future research. Further studies using the auditory matrix task may also prove fruitful. Consideration should also be given to the circumstances in which participants initially encounter the primary task - although this was not an explicit aim of the Fellowship, there were indications in the data from the attention capture studies that this may be an important factor, and experiments specifically designed to investigate this issue would be welcome. Although there was little evidence here that facial identity was an important factor, facial emotion does appear to strengthen social attention biases, at least for high-anxiety participants, so there may be scope to examine the impact of different types of WM load on attention to emotional faces. The work pursued during the term of this Fellowship has provided a foundation on which to build future programmes of in-depth studies, by identifying those methods with the greatest promise in terms of investigating the role of working memory and executive control in attention to faces and eye-gaze.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>9D7C51DD-1745-4FBF-8272-05D3593A461F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-9909203275.95361b2f00b74</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software)</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>123EE225-DA49-40C4-84DA-731B9F97BBA4</gtr:id><gtr:title>The role of working memory in eye-gaze cueing</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/dde2f2a77f33b9f0a9bd9aa01a2f3fda"><gtr:id>dde2f2a77f33b9f0a9bd9aa01a2f3fda</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Anna Law (author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>1900-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>r_7516409295cbddc63e</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>11BF5C70-2B49-4E06-95E2-4CAD1C9A9368</gtr:id><gtr:title>Assessing the impact of verbal and visuospatial working memory load on eye-gaze cueing</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Visual Cognition</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/26490cd631598d3c4084a90d18d22feb"><gtr:id>26490cd631598d3c4084a90d18d22feb</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Law A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cf9bf9b7ba9d7b</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/E017541/1</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-063-27-0064</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
