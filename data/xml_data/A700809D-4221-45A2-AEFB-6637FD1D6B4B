Fortunately, our bodies are fully capable of repairing the damage in most cases. Being able to repair these wounds is important to keep the body functioning properly. External wounds expose the body to the outside environment providing an entry point for infections, while internal wounds can prevent organs from working correctly. The body therefore has to sense when it is wounded and be able to repair the damage. Wound repair can happen in two ways. The first is to pull the edges of the wound back together, closing the body off to the outside environment. The second is to regrow parts of the body that were lost during injury. This repair response is termed regeneration.
If damage repair doesn't happen properly a number of issues can arise. When wound healing occurs slowly or not at all, the body is exposed to the outside world for longer, increasing the risk of infection. Furthermore, slow healing wounds can turn into ulcers, as can happen in diabetes patients. At the other end of the spectrum, wounds can &amp;quot;over-heal&amp;quot; leading to scarring. By understanding how wounds heal and how tissues regenerate in more detail, we can apply our knowledge to developing treatments to improve the body's ability to repair damage in a controlled way.
Most research into tissue repair has focused on how chemical signals produced by cells around the damaged area direct the repair process. More recently, however, it has become clear that cells can also respond to mechanical forces. For example, long extensions sent out by cells of the nervous system retreat away from strong mechanical forces. My research will focus on understanding how similar mechanical forces direct tissue repair. To show how mechanical forces impact on wound healing and regeneration, I will use the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Drosophila is commonly used to study many aspects of biology, as it is cheap and easy to manipulate experimentally. Furthermore, Drosophila share over 70% of genes with humans meaning that research in Drosophila can often be translated to human biology. Most importantly, Drosophila can heal wounds and regenerate tissues, meaning they are perfectly suited for my research.
One way to judge where forces are acting in a group of cells is to look at the way the cells behave. Forces can make cells change shape in a number of ways. They can make them get larger or smaller, thinner or wider and get taller or shorter. Forces can also encourage cells to move. They can make cells slip between each other and in some circumstances make them crawl over a surface. Forces can also encourage cells to grow and divide to produce two daughter cells, a process that is particularly important for regeneration. All of these cell behaviours have the potential to help a wound heal or a tissue regenerate, although we don't know how much each cell behaviour contributes. Fortunately, we can directly look at how the cells are behaving by making movies of healing tissues using modern microscopy technologies. I can then use computational tools to analyse these movies and measure all the cell behaviours I have described above. Another way to show where forces are acting during tissue repair is to measure them directly. I will use a variety of techniques that have been developed recently, all of which allow me to measure how large the forces are in healing tissues.
Once I understand the mechanical forces acting during tissue repair, I can then use techniques to change these forces and see what affect this has on the speed of repair. I will stretch and compress injured tissues and measure how fast the healing process is compared to normal. This approach has the potential to demonstrate that applying external forces to damaged tissue can speed up the healing process. This knowledge can then be used to develop new, targeted force-based therapies for tissue repair.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>It is crucial that organisms can sense and respond to wounding in order to maintain tissue continuity. This can involve the superficial closure of a wound or, in some instances, the regeneration of lost structures. Slow or absent wound healing responses can lead to ulceration and increases the risk of infection, while &amp;quot;over-healing&amp;quot; is thought to be a cause of keloidal and hypertrophic scars. Much work has demonstrated that biochemical signals are required for wound healing and regeneration. However, more recently it has become clear that cells also respond to mechanical stimuli. I therefore aim to explore the mechanical basis of wound healing and regeneration.

I will live image cell behaviours and cytoskeleton protein localisations in healing and regenerating Drosophila wing imaginal discs. I will quantitatively analyse time-lapse images of cell behaviours and protein localizations over a time course using the recently developed EpiTools software (Mao, Hoppe and Basler groups) to inform on where forces are likely to be acting within the healing tissue. I will also directly measure mechanical forces using a combination of junctional laser ablation, in vivo tension sensors and force inference software. To demonstrate how these forces contribute to the wound healing process, I will combine mechanical perturbation of wing discs with computational modeling. I will stretch healing wing discs using a bespoke device developed by the Mao and Piel groups and test whether the application of an ectopic force alters wound healing dynamics. I will further test how changing the force balance in wing discs might affect wound healing by using a computational vertex model previously developed by Yanlan Mao. By understanding the mechanical basis of wound healing and regeneration, it will then be possible to develop targeted mechanical therapies to treat wound-healing related disorders.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>As outlined in the &amp;quot;Academic Beneficiaries&amp;quot; section, scientists working within related fields will be the main beneficiaries of my research. My work is likely to have an impact that extends further than academia alone, however. The results I obtain are likely to have a direct impact on how certain therapies are developed in the future, which will contribute to enhancing the quality of life for many patients. I also intend for my work to change the general awareness of the importance of biophysics.

Clinical impact
My research will likely provide insights into how mechanical forces can be exploited to improve tissue repair in patients in whom it is defective. This is likely to be made possible through the adoption of new, targeted mechanical therapies, which will have the potential to treat chronic wound healing failure. One of the leading causes of morbidity in diabetes is ulceration due to a failure of wounds to close, which can ultimately lead to amputation after infection. Diabetes treatment is also of huge cost to the NHS every year. My research therefore has the potential to enhance the quality of life for patients while simultaneously reducing expenditure on chronic wound healing treatment. Furthermore, my research is likely to lead to new methods for increasing the speed of wound healing after surgery. Insights from my research into how the cessation of wound healing is controlled will also help in reducing scarring and in treatment of over-healing conditions such as keloid formation. More broadly, my research will also demonstrate how mechanical forces can alter cell proliferation and growth. This is likely to lead to the development of new mechanical treatments to slow tumour growth, thereby improving morbidity rates and increasing quality of life.

Commercial impact
As I describe above, my work may lead to the development of new therapies for cancer and wound healing. These therapies are likely to require the manufacture of devices and biomaterials that are capable of changing the mechanical force balance within tissues. Biomedical companies will therefore benefit from my research, as it will provide them with a new platform for product development.

Student training
My work will highlight the importance of working at the interface between physics and biology. As I outline above, in the long term this kind of work has the potential to greatly improve the quality of life for many. I intend to promote my work to younger scientists and school children to raise awareness of the importance of biophysics. This is something that requires more of a focus during school and undergraduate education. I will be involved in supervising PhD, masters, undergraduate and summer students in the Mao lab, which will help me achieve this aim to some extent. In the long term I hope to take up a university lectureship, to further inspire others to work in this field. During the course of my research I will also actively engage in schools activities, through which I will promote science in general but also more specifically biophysics. This is likely to have an impact in the future, by increasing the number of scientists working in the field. Through this, the development of the kind of therapies I describe above is likely to occur at a faster rate.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>312975</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/N014529/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>F3822669-BB5A-4BB4-BAE0-DCB9DE36E092</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Generic Health Relevance</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>CF950C9A-DB16-4E23-8AEB-94548777BCA1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>1.1  Normal biological development and functioning</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
