While the term nowaday is associated with the appalling Nazi 'experiments' on 'inferior' human beings and the death camps, historians have warned against understanding eugenics from its 'end point', that is, forced sterilization and the elimination of the 'unfit'. Over the last thirty years, without advocating that these links should be forgotten or minimized in any way, scholars have tried to understand different countries' eugenics movements as specific creations coming out the social, political and scientific circumstances at play in a particular geographical area. The characteristics, underlying assumptions and aspirations of these movements may have been very different to the eugenics of Nazi Germany in the 1930s and 1940s. Such a contextualised broader view has enabled the research of heavily class-imbued eugenics, such as that which developed in England, with a particularly strong concession to constitutionally inherited characteristics within concepts like 'feeble mindedness', has produced examinations of eugenics of different tenors such as Spanish and Latin American forms which focused more on what one British eugenicist, for the Brazilian case, qualified as basic santitation and elementary sexology, and has encouraged the study of other forms, such as Soviet eugenics, which attempted to unite eugenics and biological improvement within ostensibly Marxist political frameworks.\n\nEugenics, then, rather than a strictly defined set of theories or even methodologies for racial improvement, was inflected in accordance with a variety of factors such as: the nature of the national scientific culture of the period and the models of hereditary transmission of 'good' and 'bad' characteristics that were prevalent; the political regime that adopted or sanctioned eugenics, whether Nazism in Germany or social democracy in Scandinavia; the presence of religious misgivings or opposition, as in Portugal where the Catholic church was particularly influential; the role of 'racial' theories and a country's relation to its empire or foreign neighbours. However, if anything unites these diverse expressions, it was the fear of losing control over the ways in which a given population reproduced and lived its sexual life that was at the heart of the movement. This in turn led to a vast range of eugenic recipes for racial improvement and for a halt to the degeneration of the species.\n\nRecent historiography of eugenics has recognized both these variables and these core features and has moved beyond discussing eugenics in so-called 'mainline' countries - Britain, Germany and the United States - to extend its gaze to less commonly examined countries such as Poland, Switzerland, Spain and Hungary. Despite renewed interest in the history of eugenics, however, Portugal's reception of the science has barely been examined to date; only one academic article has been published in 1998 in Portuguese. This project seeks to fill this historiographical gap and in doing so also aims to make a significant contribution to the history of Portugal, a discipline where political history predominates and social histories of science, sexuality and cultural studies are far from the norm. Lastly, this project aims to contribute to current debate on the uses of the past to inform present discussions of the 'new eugenics' of the early twenty-first century, an era of genetic choice led by a combination of scientific advances and individualized consumer options. In similar ways to the spring 2007 issue of New Formations: A Journal of Culture/Theory/Politics, which focused on 'new' and 'old' eugenics and the relations between the two, thisstudy aims to highlight the role and relevance of the humanities in articulating such analyses.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In addition to the impact on the stated academic constituencies, this research project aims to highlight how the humanities, especially historical studies, can be employed in order to evaluate the desirability and the ethics of the choices and decisions made in the past and the present with respect to questions of medical knowledge. It seeks to invite public interrogation of the relationship between science - still often taken to speak the 'truth' about its subject of inquiry - and society as public confidence in science to resolve collective ills is subject to conflicting evaluations. The context of the 'new eugenics' or consumer genetics that researchers have identified in the last ten to fifteen years make this is particularly pressing task and it is humanities research that can make an outstanding contribution to this public debate. While policy change as such is not an objective of this research, a contribution to the social debate is, as public services, broadly speaking, need to constantly evaluate how they can be more effective and, at the same time, enhance the quality of life of citizens in their diversity and individual and collective health. By understanding how societies made decisions on these questions in the past we can come to more informed - and more ethical - decisions about the future.\n\nAs outlined in the attached Impact Pathway document, this research seeks to engage with and provide innovative content for museums and organizations situated on the cusp of the scientific and the social, in order to maximize public engagement with the implications of the research. It also intends to bring the international to the local level, by means of two exhibitions of some of the research findings. The first of these will be at the University of Leeds in the main Parkinson Building. This exhibition and the second version, taking place at the Wellcome Trust installations in London, will display photographs of the major participants of Portuguese eugenics, some reproductions of documents on eugenics, such as the covers of treatises or journal articles, graphs on international and inter-disciplinary links between Portuguese and foreign eugenicists, and explanatory panels in English. This will entail considerable translation work and linguistic expertise, well within the bounds of the researcher who has a First Class Honours degree in Spanish, Portuguese and French. Such exhibitions, planned for early 2013, will draw inspiration from other recent successful public expositions on eugenics in Warsaw and in Stockholm. The ways in which eugenics in the past can be seen to have focused on a particular encouragement of the reproduction of an 'optimum' type of human being, to the detriment of the reproduction of others, can be laid bare as obeying certain social and scientific criteria that appeared to some to be justified at the time, but which, now, are deemed abhorrent. The valuing of different types of human being in their own right is the hallmark of a truly democratic and caring society and it is these values to which this study subscribes.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>75397</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Discourses of Eugenic Science in Portugal, 1900-1950: Degeneration, Race and Sexuality</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>92201C78-2691-4394-A81C-078A0E166CA3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Exhibition of eight panels on the subject of the history of eugenics in Portugal

This reception was located in different specialist scientific and academic fields, such as anthropology, social hygiene and biotypology. 
Debates on eugenics followed the patterns experienced in many other countries of western Europe and oscillated between the twin poles of so-called negative eugenics and positive eugenics. The former sought to increase the number and quality of 'apt' individuals while the latter sought to limit the propagation of 'unfit' individuals. Within Portugal, there were strains of eugenics that were more Germanic and other expressions that were more 'Latin', the former relying more on strenuous interventions into the population and the latter on measures associated with social hygiene, marriage counseling, anti-tuberculosis campaigns and puericulture (child-centred hygiene). 
There were different emphases according to the professional background and locality of those who espoused eugenics. In Coimbra, for example, the more Germanic and anthropological strain prevailed. In Oporto, eugenics was milder in essence.
Eugenics in Portugal, however, was mainly confined to academic and specialist debate despite the existence of a Eugenics Society that had branches in Lisbon, Coimbra and Oporto. Some hygienic measures were introduced as the 1930s and 1940s wore on both eugenics was caught essentially between the twin constraints of a Catholic Church opposed to sterilization and other methods and the Salazar dictatorship that was not keen to meddle in family and reproductive affairs.
Contrary to the wishes of major eugenicists, little concrete, therefore, was achieved in respect of the impact on the population. Despite this, the general interest by the dictatorship in fomenting the population and halting the progress of disease can be read as issues that were infused with eugenic ideas.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings will be of use to those studying the history of Portugal in general, the history of the specialist sciences in Portugal, the transnational history of eugenics and, especially, so-called Latin eugenics as a distinct category of eugenics. Further, these findings will be of interest to those engaged in research on the current reach and ethical questions surrounding bio-medicine, choice and the role of experts in human reproduction.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>40B05287-34E2-4C6A-AA0E-A59A40C097FA</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d560a2cfa373.94742787</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>DE02C52F-606C-461C-958F-65C84DFDC178</gtr:id><gtr:title>Catholicism, Race and Empire: Eugenics in Portugal, 1900-1950</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/0754aaa79838be3b26db275b638333a5"><gtr:id>0754aaa79838be3b26db275b638333a5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cleminson, R.M.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-963-3860-28-1</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>5461d74e420070.87052660</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I026804/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
