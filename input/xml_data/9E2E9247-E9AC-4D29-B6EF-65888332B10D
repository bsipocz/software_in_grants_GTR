It is an anchor for studies of the internal physics, structure and dynamics of other stars. Understanding what drives the observed changes to its activity and emissions is not only of crucial importance to solar-terrestrial relations, but also has wider relevance to studies of the influence that other stars have on their local environments, with the obvious implications for habitability of detected exoplanets. Prominent among recent solar research have been studies of the current, weak Solar Cycle 24, which has shown low levels of activity that are unprecedented in the era of modern telescope and satellite observations. As we move towards the Cycle 24/25 minimum and into the new cycle, helioseismology has an important role to play in understanding not only the internal drivers for these changes, but also how long-lasting they might be. 

We will track the seismic behaviour of the Sun through the decline of the current, weak activity cycle into the next solar minimum, using the Birmingham Solar-Oscillations Network (BiSON). We will mine these data and data from other ground-based and space-borne helioseismic instruments, to isolate and extract signatures of structural and dynamic changes in interior. Using our BiSON data we will also have the first ever opportunity to conduct a seismic comparison of one full 22-year Hale cycle with another. We will also utilize resolved-Sun data from satellites and the ground-based GONG network to monitor the development of near-surface flow patterns as we head into Cycle 25, and to study the internal rotation and composition of the solar envelope.

Our other major focus relates to the now well established solar-abundance or solar modelling problem, i.e., the continuing disagreement of the structures of models constructed using updated chemical abundance determinations with the Sun (as determined by helioseismology). We will provide new constraints on the physics of the deep solar interior, in particular on the extent to which astrophysical opacities and non-standard physics might help to resolve the problem, exploiting the leading expertise of our consortium in modelling stellar interiors. This is an example of solar research that has important implications for the wider domain of stellar astrophysics.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Outreach: 

There is an important strand running through our outreach activities, arranged around the theme of collaboration between scientists and artists, with the group's work with sound artist Caroline Devine providing the focus. Professor Chaplin has initiated UK-wide activities to explore the theme of such collaborations, including organising and leading a workshop for practitioners in art-science collaborations. 

We will reach the audience of schools and the general public by organised outreach activity, publicity, talks, exhibitions, articles in popular publications, radio and (when possible) television appearances

We shall continue to develop strong links with the media, which have led to several recent appearances in broadcast and print media (e.g., BBC Radio, Guardian, Daily Mail)

We engage regularly in outreach activities (including talks) for schools and astronomical societies (we are on lists of speakers maintained by the Royal Astronomical Society and the Institute of Physics). These activities will be coordinated with Schools and outreach liaison specialists at UoB and QMUL.

Knowledge exchange:

Our strategy is to remain alert to KE opportunities, using the well-developed knowledge exchange infrastructures at UoB and QMUL. We shall be alert to opportunities for interdisciplinary research opportunities. 

We shall provide skilled, well-trained students and PDRAs (with excellent transferable skills) for the academic community and non-academic professional sectors. This includes training of young scientists as part of major international collaborations led by the applicants (i.e., as formally recognised structures within collaborations); and UK-wide training of PhD students (e.g., involvement in lecturing and organising graduate summer schools, including STFC Schools).

There is also knowledge transfer to the astronomy community, i.e., the solar/stellar and exoplanet communities and the wider astronomy community (where our work has relevance in galactic, extra-galactic and cosmology studies). This will be achieved by publications in refereed journals (including high-impact, non-specialist journals like Science, Nature and Publications of the National Academy of Sciences); and seminars and talks to a wide professional audience, including the general astronomical community and the solar and stellar physics communities.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>374826</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/R000417/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>CC54D2C6-621F-4715-96B2-C951ECBAF1C4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Solar &amp; terrestrial physics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>158FC7A6-6652-4271-9D78-11BEE91FADDD</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Solar Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
