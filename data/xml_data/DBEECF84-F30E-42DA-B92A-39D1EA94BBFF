It will also work directly with various stakeholders to map a way forward in addressing the needs of these kinship families. 

The most recent estimates of kinship care through analyses of the 2001 Census here at the Hadley Centre found that around 1 in 77 children in the UK were living with relatives or friends, otherwise known as kinship care. Although perceived as better than non- relative foster care, many children in kinship care experience mental health and behavioural difficulties due to previous experiences of maltreatment; most live in poverty and deprivation; and carers, who are mainly grandparents, are also more likely to suffer from physical and mental health concerns. Support and services from local authorities is most likely when the kinship carers are registered as foster carers, although in the most recent estimates, this constituted only around 5% of the 173,200 children living with relatives in the UK. All four UK Governments have acknowledged the need to support all kinship families. However, service provision remains very patchy and concerns have been raised about the extent of the needs of kinship families that are not being met through Government interventions. 

The effects of social and demographic changes in the UK such as the economic downturn and patterns of migration, may all have contributed to a changed distribution of kinship care to that seen with the 2001 Census. Furthermore, one of the main findings of the previous Census analyses was that the characteristics of kinship carers, for example the carer type (grandparent/sibling) and ethnicity, varied between and within the four UK countries, although these differences were not explored in great detail. Therefore, this research will conduct more in-depth analyses of the 2011 Census microdata to explore these differences between and within the four UK countries and also compare children growing in kinship care to those living with at least one parent. 

This in-depth view of kinship care in the UK will be useful to policy makers, practitioners, academics, third sector organisations lobbying for and supporting kinship families, as well as organisations campaigning against child poverty (Family Rights Group, Grandparents' Association, Grandparents Plus, Barnardo's, Office of the Children's Commissioner, Save the Children and UNICEF). All outputs from the study will be made available freely through the project website and other social media platforms. 

Through the establishment of a stakeholder advisory group at the outset of the study, and through interviews and a survey, the research will work directly with a variety of key stakeholders (kinship families, academics, policy makers, practitioners and third sector organisations) to discuss the key economic, social and policy challenges of kinship care in the UK and map a way forward. A special effort will be made to reach the general public through media and social network platforms. This would especially be useful in getting the message across to kinship families who are not in receipt of any services from local authorities to inform them of the findings of this study and provide details on whom they could contact for further information and support.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM THE RESEARCH AND HOW WILL THEY BENEFIT?
The research will generate new academic, political and public awareness and understanding of the extent and prevalence of kinship care households in the UK, including the proportion of kinship carers not known to local authorities. This new evidence base has the potential to impact on policies regarding kinship care at local, regional and central governmental levels in the four UK countries. The disaggregated analyses down to local authority level will provide a scientific evidence base for local authorities and policy makers to better target these vulnerable families facilitating policy formation, implementation and effective resource allocation. Given that the analyses of the 2001 Census found that 95% of the kinship families are unknown to the local authorities, this research also aims to raise the profile of this hidden population of kinship families and harness political will to change policy and practice regarding how the needs these families are assessed and addressed. The research output will also be beneficial to practitioners working within Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (CAFCASS), educational services, CAMHS and the NHS in terms of signposting a population who may be in need of their support. As all UK Governments have pledged to eradicate child poverty by 2020, the results pertaining to the poverty and deprivation faced by kinship families will be of significant use to policy makers working within Governments to facilitate this goal. It is hoped that through impacting these policy and practice developments, the project in the longer term will lead to better health and wellbeing of children and carers living in kinship care arrangements. 

The evidence will also be of interest to stakeholders such as third sector organisations and those campaigning for children's right and against child poverty (for example, Family Rights Group, Grandparents' Association, Grandparents Plus, Barnardo's, Child Poverty Action Group Office of the Children's Commissioner, Save the Children and UNICEF). 

The research will also act as a conduit to collaborative work and debates between various stakeholders (including kin carers, policymakers at various levels, third sector organisations, academics, private sector and practitioners) by engaging with the stakeholders from the outset of the project and facilitating a dialogue through the advisory group and stakeholder interviews, which innovatively uses the Delphi method to feed back the results to stakeholders before reaching consensus.

In order to facilitate these outcomes, the dissemination of output to these beneficiaries will be carried out during and after the project life cycle through several activities. The dissemination of the project results through the website, multiple social media and other direct media platforms will enhance the public understanding of kinship care and also reach out to those kinship families, who may be in need of support, encouraging them to contact the relevant authorities. 
Two separate conferences will be organised at the end of the research project to disseminate the findings to the key stakeholders and academics. The stakeholder conference, which will be organised in partnership and hosted by a stakeholder, will focus more on the policy and practice implications. The research will also be presented at other practitioner workshops as well as academic conferences. 

The well established research, policy and practice links of the Hadley Centre and the networks of the stakeholders will be utilised to convey the messages from the research to a wide local and international policy, practice and academic audience.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-02-19</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-24</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>159906</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Press coverage (Children and Young People Now)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6F18139D-DFDB-4D6D-8057-FCECF36BA11C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Press coverage of results from the first briefing paper published in October 2015</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d5b45992a8a4.04907244</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.cypnow.co.uk/print_article/cyp/news/1154192/majority-of-children-in-kinship-care-live-in-deprivation?print=true</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Press coverage (Community Care)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>57A15753-1AA5-4271-B8BA-321969C10472</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Press coverage of results from the first briefing paper published in October 2015</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d576fdbbb1a7.61214780</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.communitycare.co.uk/2015/10/13/three-quarters-children-kinship-care-living-deprived-household-study-reveals/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Radio coverage ( Heart Ipswich)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9F3590A5-4A00-459B-9966-16696677054B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>News coverage of results from the first briefing paper published in October 2015</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d5bf1fab7f72.39827465</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Engagement with stakeholders</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C58C3BAE-BB37-4E76-A41B-40E22A3BF405</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In order to facilitate better outcomes for children and families in kinship care situations, who are the ultimate beneficiaries of this research, the results of the study need to be accessible and useful to a to a number of distinct audiences including; 1) Policy makers and service providers 2) Third sector organisations such as charities and organisations campaigning for children's right and against child and 3) the kinship families. Therefore, this project has continuous knowledge exchange and co-production of knowledge through direct engagement and collaboration a stakeholder advisory group, which was set up at the outset of the project. The group has representation from:
Department for Business, innovation and skills
Department for Education
Family Rights Group
Grandparents Plus
 Islington borough 
Child poverty action group, Scotland
Office of the children's commissioner
Solicitor
CAFCASS
Kinship Carer
The Grandparents' Association
Barnardo's 
Centre for Social Justice
Buttle UK
Capability Scotland
Children's Rights Alliance for England

The advisory group members provide continued guidance and advice on analyses that would be useful in a practice and policy context. 

Group members such as the Family Rights group and the Grandparents Plus used data published in the first briefing paper from this study to influence changes to the Welfare Reform and Work Bill.

When parents, especially mothers are imprisoned, relatives step in to look after the children, It is estimated that around mothers of 17,000 children are affected every year by the imprisonment of their mothers and that around 40% of these children a looked after by kinship carers, especially grandparents. The meeting was attended by MPs, Lords and third sector organisations, who all agreed that these children and the families who look after them need more support provision. 


In this ongoing study, analyses of anonymised data from the latest 2011 census found that 152,910 children were growing up in the care of relatives in England. Putting that number in context, the number of children in kinship care has grown by 7% over the past decade, far exceeding the 2% overall increase of the number of children in the population.

The results indicate that in households without a parent present in England, it was grandparents who most often stepped in to care for a child - 51% of these children were looked after by grandparents in 2011, compared to 44% in 2001. Older siblings were the next most common carers, looking after 23% of children, although this decreased from 38% in 2001. The remaining children were being brought up by another relative such as an aunt, an uncle or a cousin.

Of the children growing up in kinship care, 32% were of minority ethnic origin, compared to 21% of all children growing up with parents across the population. Looking at the minority ethnic group more in detail, it was apparent that one in every 37 black children in the whole census population (including black Caribbean, black African and other black ethnicities) were growing up in the care of relatives, compared with one in every 83 white children.

Children in kinship care were also twice as likely to have a long-term health problem or disability compared with those children living with parents. A large number, 40%, of these children were also living in the poorest areas of England and were living in households affected by some kind of deprivation - in housing, employment, education, health or disability. One in every 25 children in kinship care were living in the most deprived households in the country, compared with one in every 159 children living with their parents.

The change in family structures from the traditional mother-father set-up needs to be understood and properly addressed. The group of vulnerable children that grow up in kinship care are largely ignored in family policies, where the presumption is that children are brought up by parents. Family set-ups are changing and the government's policies need to address this properly. Our results indicate a pressing need for urgent support and services to be provided to these children and their kinship families.

* Kinship care in this study was defined as an instance where children are brought up by relatives in the absence of parent/s.

The disaggregated analyses down to local authority level provides a scientific evidence base for local authorities and policy makers to better target vulnerable kinship families facilitating policy formation, implementation and effective resource allocation.

The evidence will also be of interest to stakeholders such as third sector organisations and those campaigning for children's right and against child poverty (for example, Family Rights Group, Grandparents' Association, Barnardo's, Child Poverty Action Group Office of the Children's Commissioner, Save the Children and UNICEF).

The research is also a conduit to collaborative work and ongoing debates between various stakeholders including kin carers, policy makers at various levels, third sector organisations, academics and the private sector, which are facilitated through the academic and stakeholder advisory groups, established at the outset of the project.


Over the last 20 or so years, academic research on kinship care in the UK has raised the profile of kinship care arrangements, whilst raising concerns about the lack of service provision for most kinship families. This ongoing study provides the most up to date, reliable and representative statistics on kinship care in the UK, which can be a baseline for future research studies on kinship care. The disaggregated prevalence rates, down to local authority level provide accurate sampling frames for future research, and inform sampling methodology and costing.
