This knowledge is primordial to explain how certain cancers develop and how ageing progresses.
The telomeres composed of repetitive non-coding DNA are degraded after each cell division. Their role is to protect the genes that are found downstream on the chromosomes. To re-enforce this protection the telomeres are proposed to form DNA structures that hide the extremity from degradation. However, this protection might be problematic during cell division when the replication machinery collapses into these DNA structures. It is propose that enzymes called DNA helicases can relieve this protection momentarily to achieve replication of the telomeres.

We know some of the proteins involved in helping replication at the telomeres and how important they are to suppress the damage response that is responsible of genome instability, one of the hallmarks of cancer. However the detailed mechanistic of suppression of the damage response is still missing.

Discovering this mechanism is essential to better understand how telomeres are faithfully replicated and how it suppresses the development of tumorigenesis. Investigating what are the enzymes that lead to the formation of aberrant telomeres is key to decode the mechanism that facilitates replication at telomeres.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The formation and/or metabolism of DNA secondary structures is important for many physiological processes, and is particularly relevant during DNA replication, transcription and repair. However, persistent or aberrantly processed DNA secondary structures can have pathological consequences and are an established source of genome instability. DNA secondary structures can form from alternative DNA sequence motifs (eg. trinucleotide repeats or guanine rich DNA that form four stranded DNA structures called G-quadruplexes (G4)) or as an intermediate formed during DNA replication, repair or recombination. Bioinformatics? data has demonstrated that DNA secondary structures motifs are conserved throughout evolution. Furthermore, the discovery of specialised factors required for dismantling or bypassing such DNA structures, together with the direct observation of G4 focus formation in human cells strongly supports their existence in vivo.

Efficient genome-wide replication requires not only the replicative polymerase but also bypass polymerases, dismantling helicases and repair activities, which engage with the replisome when it encounters DNA damage, topological constraints, transcription complexes and DNA secondary structures. Failure to stabilize, repair or restart the replication fork is a potential source of genome instability, the hallmark of many diseases including cancer. Thus, the cell possesses mechanisms to regulate both the disassembly of DNA secondary structures during DNA replication and the re-establishment of the DNA or chromatin marks after duplication. Evidence is emerging that several replication and repair proteins impact on telomere replication to avert telomere fragility, but the nature, cause and links to human disease remain unknown. 

Ultimately, the program of research comprises complementary multidisciplinary approaches that will encompass molecular and cellular biology, proteomics and vertebrate genetics (mouse and human cells) to discover and examine new genes required for faithful replication at telomeres and throughout the genome. The research will provide a framework for comprehending the contributions of replication factors in general DNA replication and cancer in humans. First, I propose to investigate the enzymatic activities of known and new factors that suppress replication stress at telomeres.

Telomere replication stress displays as multiple spatially distinct telomere foci induced by replication stress (aphidicolin) along common fragile sites (CFS) present as chromosome discontinuities. This raises the possibility that telomere-linked replication problems are processed similarly to CFS. Stable shRNA knock-down or generated Knock-Out mammalian cell lines will help evaluate the genetic interactions of the known nucleases MUS81 and XPF in the suppression of telomere fragility similarly or not to the suppression of CFS.
In order to identify new factors responsible for the induction of telomere fragility in response to replication stress, I will employ proteomics of isolated chromatin (PICh) to identify the factors that are recruited and/or excluded specifically to fragile telomeres. This will be carried out in collaboration with Peter Faull, head of Biological Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics Laboratory at MRC-CSC. Candidates will be then confirmed and characterised by shRNA knock-down to study their role in maintaining genome stability and telomere homeostasis.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>787334</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E9C089F6-CF65-400B-B68E-E5A8378015D7</gtr:id><gtr:title>A Distinct Class of Genome Rearrangements Driven by Heterologous Recombination.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Molecular cell</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/df27921b3015cf4f559a34eb88414600"><gtr:id>df27921b3015cf4f559a34eb88414600</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Le?n-Ortiz AM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1097-2765</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a9cf484ca9a57.27542120</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MC_UP_1102/14</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>7C58A707-1BF6-4573-A44F-30B271C80813</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cancer</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
