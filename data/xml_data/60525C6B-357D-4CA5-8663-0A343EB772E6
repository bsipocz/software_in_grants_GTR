Government bodies, such as the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), have been established to provide a more systematic approach to decision making. One of the main criteria on which these agencies base their decisions is the cost of achieving a given health gain from the treatment evaluated, where health is usually measured in terms of quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. However, the guidance as to what is an acceptable cost per QALY is unclear. One way of attempting to overcome this problem is to determine empirically what one QALY is worth in monetary terms so that the cost of the treatment can be compared with the benefits of it. As part of the doctoral research, three different money values of QALYs were estimated by asking members of the public how much they would be willing to pay for health improvements amounting to one QALY. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>This aim of this postdoctoral fellowship is to disseminate this work to a wider audience through the publication of papers and presentations.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>121570</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>My PhD research was the first to explicitly estimate and compare whether the monetary value of a Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) may differ depending on how the QALY gain arises. This research found that the type of QALY gain does matter to members of the public, in particular that people give higher value to interventions which are life saving. This has led to a further stream of work led by Dr Rachel Baker funded by the MRC (G1002324) on which I am a co-investigator, to examine the views of members of the public on the provision of End of Life Care for people with a terminal illness in the UK.</gtr:description><gtr:id>B01B2527-647E-4C35-B698-E6CC096D805D</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>544fab410eb309.67671875</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The health care budget in the UK is finite and, as such, decisions must be made about how best to allocate scarce resources. Cost effectiveness analysis and its overall summary measure of cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained from an intervention is used as part of the decision as to which interventions are recommended for adoption by the NHS. The underlying QALY model assumes that all QALYs are equal no matter what the combination of quality of life and life expectancy. Within my PhD research I assessed the hypothesis that the monetary value of a QALY will vary according to whether the QALY gain arises because of a change in quality of life or a change in life expectancy. The contingent valuation method was used to estimate three different monetary values of a QALY which could be applied to three types of health care intervention; treatments which improve quality of life only, those which increase life expectancy only and treatments which are essentially life saving. In addition a Q methodology study was conducted to investigate what features of health care interventions, including the type of health gain, are important to members of the public in England in making priority-setting decisions and to understand why. 

The focus of this research grant was to produce outputs from my PhD research. The key objectives were to publish papers based on my thesis, disseminate the work more widely through conference presentations and develop new research proposals. This grant resulted in three papers directly from thesis chapters. These papers added new knowledge to the academic literature within health economics in two key areas; 1) new evidence on how the monetary value of a Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) differs depending on how the QALY gain arises; 2) The use of Q methodology as a means to determine the views of members of public. 
The three key papers published from my thesis have been cited 41 times. 
 This research was presented at 3 academic conferences.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>the results of my PhD work indicated that the monetary value of a QALY may differ depending on the type of health gain that arises.
