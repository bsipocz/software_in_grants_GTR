Long-Term Evolution (LTE), which is the dominant system for 4G networks, has introduced state-of-the-art fountain coding to support data broadcast and multicast services. The appealing property of fountain codes to adapt transmission rate to channel conditions, regardless of the number of receiving mobile users, is however constrained by a trade-off between latency and network overhead. The inherent requirement of content streaming for low latency can thus lead to a significant increase in overhead which, as recent research suggests, can be alleviated if adjacent mobile nodes form cooperative clusters. More specifically, 4G-enabled devices equipped with short-range communication capabilities, such as WiFi or Bluetooth, could request missing packets from neighbouring devices. The use of network coding in each cooperative cluster could further reduce traffic and energy consumption. Therefore, the combination of point-to-multipoint fountain coding and collaborative network coding at the application layer with point-to-point channel coding at the physical layer is an attractive alternative design to conventional automatic repeat request (ARQ) protocols, which can be less energy and bandwidth efficient.
 
Nevertheless, there is great scope for tailoring the proposed scheme to the requirements of upcoming 4G broadband technologies and developing radically new paradigms to satisfy the increasing demand for streaming and downloading of high quality media in next generation networks communications. The proposed project aims to develop a mathematical framework to identify key relationships between the various network parameters, contribute to the understanding of network dynamics and assist in the system-level optimisation of network-coded architectures. The benefits of low-level optimisation will also be harnessed if separate designs of channel coding and network coding are replaced by joint designs for content distribution, which better leverage the benefits of redundancy and boost reliability without requiring significant changes to existing infrastructures. The project also aspires to delve into the emerging research field of network error correction and develop practical implementations of unified channel and network codes that deliver high reliability, low decoding complexity and increased security from malicious users.

The proposed research will be carried out in consultation with international collaborators from universities in Portugal and Norway and its outcomes will benefit not only mobile ad-hoc architectures, but related systems too, such as broadband fixed wireless access networks, machine-to-machine communications and image &amp;amp; video processing. We anticipate that our work on network error control techniques will contribute to the reinforcement of the UK research base and play an important role in putting the UK at the forefront of developments in the arena of next-generation mobile technology.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Surveys show that individuals in Great Britain are becoming more and more accustomed to using mobile-broadband access for content streaming and downloading. The increase in demand for content-on-the move will soon stretch 4G mobile technologies to their limits. Only research for the advancement of existing technologies but also exploration of emerging radical approaches can push technological limits, so that increasing demands are met.

Our proposed work endeavours to foster fundamental research on network information flow with inherent error-correction capabilities for content streaming and downloading over mobile wireless networks. Effective dissemination of our research contributions will have a major impact on related research fields (as explained in the section on Academic Beneficiaries) but also on industrial development. With the help of NEC - our industrial partner - the feasibility of our work will be assessed and our findings will be promoted to meetings of wireless standardisation bodies. We anticipate that our fundamental work will strengthen the research base of communication theory and lead to follow-on implementation-oriented research, which will have a transformative effect on the design of future mobile communication networks. Telecommunication equipment manufacturers will be given the opportunity to develop next-generation mobile products capable of delivering throughput and reliability beyond the state-of-the-art, while service providers will offer broadcast and multicast services with improved quality-of-service to the end user.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>98437</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Results of this project were disseminated in COST action meetings and discussed with Prof. &amp;Aacute;ngeles V&amp;aacute;zquez-Castro, who is the leader of the Working Group on the Practical Aspects of Network Coding (http://www.network-coding.eu/working.html).

Our technology-agnostic models were adapted to the existing LTE Advanced standard for fourth-generation (4G) mobile communications and showed that the service coverage for video streaming can be improved by a factor of 2.5 over conventional multi-rate transmission methods. We investigated efficient methods for decoding network codes on the fly, as opposed to buffering a large number of received coded packets before we attempt to decode them, and developed techniques to 'tune' decoding delay to the severity of the communication channel and reduce unnecessary complex operations at receiving terminals.
[COLLABORATIONS]: Joint research in the area of network coding has been carried out with overseas institutions. Strong links were established with:
(a) Dr Dejan Vukobratovic at the University of Novi Sad in Serbia. We have jointly developed mathematical expressions to model the performance of layered services and extended them to resource allocation schemes. 
(b) Dr. Daniel Lucani at Aalborg University in Denmark. Our group developed accurate stochastic models and Dr. Lucani's group will validate them in practical network configurations. 
(c) Prof. Simon Blackburn and Miss Jessica Claridge at Royal Holloway, University of London. Our collaboration characterised the inherent secrecy attribute of random linear network coding and obtained analytical formulas that provide the probability of an eavesdropper partially decoding network-coded messages.
(d) Dr. Francisco Monteiro at ISCTE-IUL in Portugal. We explored the possibility of introducing techniques that are widely used in Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) detection to network decoding algorithms.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The project was completed in July 2015. In addition to disseminating our results in the form of publications, the following pathways have also been explored:
[KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER IN UK INSTITUTIONS]: Key findings were presented to various research groups in the form of invited talks and seminars. We showcased our results to the University College London (UCL) in June 2014, the University of Edinburgh in November 2014, the University of Bristol in February 2015 and the University of Liverpool in March 2015.
[INTERNATIONAL OUTREACH]: The PI joined the management team of the relevant COST Action IC1104 'Random Network Coding and Designs over GF(q)'. This COST Action offered a great opportunity to meet researchers working on similar fields and a unique vehicle to communicate outcomes and share ideas with both academics and professionals. The PI was invited to deliver an 1-hour tutorial on the techniques and findings of the project in a COST meeting in Istanbul, Turkey
