This claim is a reflection of the absence in China of some of the more formal legal and regulatory institutions of the market economies of the global north. Although the claim that China lacks formal legal mechanisms of market governance may have been somewhat overstated, it is the case that informal finance, particularly in the form of trade credit, family lending and communal investing, has played a major role in supporting China's growth. The prevalence of informal finance constitutes a significance source of flexibility for China's economy given the limitations of the formal sector, which remains dominated by state-owned banks lending largely to state-owned enterprises. Informal finance is also evolving quickly and is converging with the use of internet technologies to deliver finance ('fintech') through such mechanisms as crowdfunding. 

However, there are downsides to the reliance of the Chinese economy on informal finance and significant risks arise from its convergence with fintech. The large shadow banking sector, by virtue of its positioning outside most of the regulations applying to mainstream banks, adds to systemic risks. The formal and informal sector coexist in an uneasy relationship: they may substitute for each other, or provide complementary modes of finance, but they can also operate to reinforce and magnify systemic risks, as in the case of the crisis in Wenzhou after 2011. 

Similarly, the rise of fintech is a double edged sword. On the one hand, cloud computing and big data may be facilitating new forms of social credit and collective investment schemes which have the potential to meet the needs of the growing social credit sector. Crowdfunding may provide a new and flexible form of financing for start-ups and innovative ventures. However, these new forms of finance also have the potential to undercut or render otiose regulations designed to maintain market transparency, and to intensify the risks facing investors. 

Against this background, we propose to conduct a multiple methods research project which will explore the phenomenon of informal finance in China, identify the risks and potential associated with it, and assess how regulation can best respond to the risks while not sacrificing the innovations and flexibility associated with it, particularly in the context of 'fintech'. The projects will be organised in four work packages which correspond to three of the five themes identified in the ESRC-NSFC Call:

WP1 [theme 1]: Understanding the limits of informal financing

WP2 [theme 2]: Regulating shadow banking

WP3 [theme 5]: The potential of new technology to promote financial innovation and development ('fintech')

WP4 [theme 2]: Building a social credit system</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research?

Beneficiaries in the commercial private sector will include financial firms and banks with interests and activities in China and the UK. We expect the research to be of particular interest to UK-based and other multinational banks and financial institutions which are active in China. We already have good contacts with a number of these financial firms and would build on them further to ensure effective dissemination of results. Another group of stakeholders where we have good contacts are international law firms including those based in the City of London; we would expect this group to be very interested in our research, as they have been with our recent ESRC-funded research on law and financial development.

Beneficiaries among policy makers and governmental bodies will include, firstly, officials in international organisations with an interest in financial development in China. These include the World Bank, the IMF, Asian Development Bank, EBRD and ILO. We have good links with these organisations and will be able to communicate effectively with them as in the recent past. Secondly, we expect that the work will be of considerable interest to officials and ministries in China and the UK. We expect to be able to liaise effectively with this group of stakeholders and will use the stakeholder workshop planned for the start of the project to further build relationships with them. Thirdly, we will be in a good position to communicate with civil servants and other governmental policy makers in other governments, using existing links and contacts.

Beneficiaries in the wider public sector and the third sector will include NGOs in the development field and other interested civil society organisations. 

The findings of the work will be of direct interest to many members of the wider public and we will aim to communicate effectively with this audience by liaising with journalists and opinion formers and through use of social media. 

How will they benefit from this research?

The research will lead to a deeper understanding of the role of informal finance in generating growth in China and of the risks and potential it creates. Understanding this issue will be critical to an objective and informed understanding of China's growth path, and its sustainability. China's economic trajectory is of interest at a global level, but is of particular concern to the business community and government in the UK given the strong development of UK-China ties in recent years. Our research will aim to foster mutual understanding between UK and Chinese researchers and research users.

Research users will particularly benefit from the extension of the CBR's leximetric datasets, the CBR Shareholder Protection Index and Creditor Protection Index, from their current 30 countries (http://www.cbr.cam.ac.uk/datasets/).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>314347</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/P004091/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4511FB20-8392-418E-809D-7701FACC03C9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Law &amp; legal studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0E99303-35B5-4458-9B00-D93E2E075C9F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Finance and Accounting</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BF887C15-B29F-4C4C-8420-88AF17A8FFE1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Financial economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>085E9E17-60A5-4B2D-B9C5-F950A45872C5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Law and economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B75590D5-E385-45F1-B6D0-CC3EDEFDE67D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Socio Legal Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>C11BDEA9-7D9D-4728-B6A9-31032921B328</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Newton</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
