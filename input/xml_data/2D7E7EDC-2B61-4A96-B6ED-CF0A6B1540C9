COMPELLING USER EXPERIENCES IN FITTING ROOMS THROUGH VISUAL SEARCH</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Small Business Research Initiative</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>972208</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Snap Fashion's project addresses the well-recognised problem that the in-store clothes shopping experience is becoming increasingly outdone by today?s online offering. This chasm in customer experience between the online and offline worlds is resulting in consumers exchanging their high street shopping trip in favour of a quick and efficient online clothes purchase. Although we believe there will always be strong incentive to visit a physical store when buying fashion, the outdated and tech-free experience is having a significant effect on high street footfall.

Consequently we have developed a system which will revolutionise the UK high-street?s fitting rooms. Our product, Snap InStore, uses tags on clothing to identify which items have just been taken into a fitting room. This is the trigger for a visual search. The user then answers a series of questions which drives product recommendations of visually similar or complementary items.

The system addresses four fundamental flaws in the current instore experience:
1) Product discovery. It is a common occurance that brands have more product lines than they can stock in-store. Consequently consumers are aware that shopping online with their favourite brands can yield more results, rather than restrict themselves to a more limited product set selected by the in-store buyers. Embedding Snap InStore within fitting rooms allows retailers to showcase their entire product range from a physical store. This immediately allows the high-street to compete with online; all of the choice of an online shop, but with the immediacy and satisfaction of an in-store shopping spree.

2) In-store conversion. When an item is taken into a fitting room the user is expressing their highest intent to buy. However, the conversion rate falls just short of 30%. Instead of customers leaving the fitting room disappointed, and high-street retailers missing out on this high-intent purchasing opportunity, showcasing alternatives will increase conversions. Snap's technology has been proven to increase conversion rates by over a third.

3) Data and analytics. For the 70% of items of items discarded in fitting rooms, their history is unknown. Was it the price point, the quality, a poor fit, or any other other reason? Snap InStore captures users feedback instantaneously, providing retailers with invaluable data on how to further improve their product range.

4) Sharing what you've bought online with friends is easy - it's just one tap. Sharing instore is harder - you have to take a photo or log in on a shared device. Our technology broadcasts to multiple devices; meaning that a consumer can have a public experience on an iPad, and a private experience on their personal mobile.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>998464</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">972208</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
