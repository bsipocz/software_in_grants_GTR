It is a two year feasibility study.There is body of knowledge about sensors, sensor networks, and aggregation of sensor information on which we can build. But while there are a number of systems for monitoring and informing consumers about energy use, these tend to be closed systems in which the information service provide controls the infrastructure, be this an energy provider, a road traffic information system, or a building management system.The assumptions which underlie this work are threefold:i) that globally deployed solutions will use mobile phones to interact with users (since in many parts of the world this is the only information infrastructure);ii) that there is a gap in our knowledge about how information applications can influence user behaviour both individually and as a collective; andiii) that we require platforms that both give flexibility to allow the rapid evolution of deployed applications, and are commercially viable.This is not a technology development study; the building blocks - sensor networks and mobile handsets - are available. It is an examination of two distinct but interacting challenges: (i) developing and evolving compelling and influential energy information applications; and(ii) providing a large scale commercial platform on which this development and evolution can be undertaken by independent application providers in light of observed behaviour.In each case the specific instances (energy awareness application, sensor aggregation) and general methodologies (user-centric application development, intermediate network services) will be examined. To meet these challenges we have brought together a multidisciplinary team from Cambridge, Nottingham, Exeter, and China Mobile. The expertise includes business modelling, networking and distributed systems, security, psychology, and sociology.China Mobile have allocated $100k in personnel and other costs to this project.China Mobile, the world's largest mobile operator are a key partner in this project, having demonstrated a willingness to entertain business models and deploy intermediate services - such as aggregation of sensor information - to allow application innovation by third parties.As well as providing insights into the problems described (and many subproblems) the main output of this project will transferred to commercial exploitation via China Mobile or one of its global partners and via the Horizon Digital Economy Hub at Nottingham and Cambridge.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>36780</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The notion of contextual archetypes have now been used to understand changing behaviours in delivering complex service contracts of object performance such as Rolls Royce engines and aircrafts.

Data collected from a survey on smartphone users conducted with China Mobile 
in Malaysia, Singapore and Beijing demonstrated a role of context (i.e. situation) within co-creation, as opposed to simply considering the user's profile or disposition. For instance, studying smart phone users in isolation would not take into consideration the multitude of applications (apps) that can be very valuable in different contexts.
The survey also demonstrated the influence of effectual reasoning (rather than causal reasoning) on technology use, requiring focus on context as well as use. For instance, smart phone users acquire apps not only based on demand (i.e. I need to do something, so I find an app for that), but also because some apps may be useful to them in the future.
A framework for contextual invariances for the business/pricing model was developed. This has the potential to assist firms in achieving better value co-creation capabilities and in reducing energy consumption. Monitoring hardware and software has been developed and deployed within the Computer Laboratory building at the University of Cambridge as a test bed and in domestic buildings through the University of Nottingham.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>As mentioned, the key finding is the role of context (situation) in behaviours and how context might be codified as archetypes so that firms can plan around archetypes rather than having the high risk of variety.
