He has also worked with Fairtrade cooperatives in evaluating the ecological and economic sustainability of organic coffee production, the impacts of changing climate and markets, and facilitating the development of strategies to address these risks. Research has evaluated the provision of environmental services from producer systems, including evaluation of carbon stocks and carbon footprint under different production systems. Thus the applicant has detailed knowledge of ecosystem services and their management from one sector and one region providing Fairtrade coffee to UK and European markets. This project will allow the evaluation of the contribution of Fairtrade licensed companies in the UK and Europe to promoting ecosystem management, building on the applicants and Twin?s and experience with companies and producer organizations.

The main activities will include:
i. Synthesis of existing studies of environmental impacts of Fairtrade and related sustainability programmes.
ii. Initial scoping of initiatives of Fairtrade companies with initiatives related to supporting ecosystem service provision in producer communities.
iii. Interviews with Fairtrade licensed companies on their actual support activities to promote biodiversity and ecosystem services, and their interest supporting ecosystem services in producer communities
through payments for environmental services.
iv. For a selection of initiatives (3 case studies) conduct interviews with all value chain participants to elucidate outcomes and effectiveness of such initiatives; how these initiatives relate to the business models of the company in terms of CSR and marketing; and potential for establishment of payments for environmental services.
 v. Conduct in-country evaluation of outcomes in pducer countries for case studies in at least 2 countries.
vi. Develop Guides of Best Practices for Fairtrade Licensees in integrating actions to support ecosystem services among their producer suppliers.
vii. Roundtable with interested Fairtrade licensees to share results from case studies and obtain feedback on guide of best practices.
viii. Development of final report on case studies and company surveys and preparation of article for distribution in sustainable/green business media.


Case studies will be selected from value chain initiatives in which Twin has involvement in Latin America and Africa, supporting small-scale producers. Potential case studies include: a) in Malawi a Twin Joint Marketing Initiative and a FRICH public private partnership has implemented a sustainable agriculture pilot now in the process of being scaled up; b) Reforestation payments to organic coffee producers in Nicaragua with support from their UK buyer; c) Ghanaian Cocoa cooperative who receive informal Payment of Environmental Service for tree planting to sequester carbon from their buyer, d) Twin supported climate adaptation projects with coffee producers in Uganda. The case studies will be selected depending on a more detailed revision of the actions being undertaken and their level of development, and most importantly on the interest of the companies participating to collaborate in the study.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>19467</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>100000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Evaluation of Impacts of Fairtrade on Smallholder Coffee Producers</gtr:description><gtr:end>2014-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Fairtrade International</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>49C087DD-1966-47DD-B73D-6985E56A05C7</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d851bd9cd3d5.53990890</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-09-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The findings were used to support Twin's Adapt Now campaign that has resulted in two new investments from UK retailers Marks &amp;amp; Spencer's and Sainsbury's with UK coffee roaster Matthew Algie to support climate adaptation by coffee farmers in Peru and Uganda</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>9E064DA2-DD94-48E2-8511-CE2B9AE08C4C</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5460dc62c8e3b1.67461359</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Companies are becoming increasingly aware of the
threat to security of supply from climate change and
environmental degradation, which is leading to
decreasing or variable supply.
The best practice initiatives reviewed for this study
mostly started out as Corporate Social Responsibility programmes that supported
general social and environmental projects. Now,
ensuring the sustainability of the ecosystems that
their businesses depend on is part of their business
plan. Certification of products or voluntary carbon
accreditation, are seen as added marketing benefits,
rather than being the main drivers for investment. Investing in supporting their farmer suppliers to adapt to climate change is seen as a central to reducing risk to their companies</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>General recommendations were made as to best practice to companies wishing to invest supporting their suppliers in adapting to climate change these included:
1. initiatives should be closely aligned with the environmental
needs and aims of producer organisations
2. restoring ecological processes requires medium to long term
commitments often from an alliance of companies
and producer organisations
3. potential trade-offs between ecosystem services should be
considered, such as the benefits of planting fast-growing
species for carbon capture versus increasing biodiversity
4. scientific criteria are needed to assess whether the
desired ecological impacts are being delivered: e.g. the
assumption that reforestation restores water supply
5. interventions should seek to engage with local policies
that may support or hinder the overall aims</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0C390FDF-C8CE-4783-AD58-F500B7CCF0F1</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5460de10702ff6.99956113</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment,Retail</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9EBE495E-6645-4A4B-B7EF-26CDCFC70F56</gtr:id><gtr:title>Supporting Ecosystem Services in Fairtrade Value Chains</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d2ab0c4042be1f23c00ffacece22d020"><gtr:id>d2ab0c4042be1f23c00ffacece22d020</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Haggar J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5460df091f4c19.14128452</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C787DCE5-F7D4-498B-BE42-3E5BA38BBA8B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Land use change on coffee farms in southern Guatemala and its environmental consequences.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Environmental management</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d2ab0c4042be1f23c00ffacece22d020"><gtr:id>d2ab0c4042be1f23c00ffacece22d020</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Haggar J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0364-152X</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56d84d7ced1591.03315242</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>873BDD34-C2C9-4459-ADDE-E67E8EF1A9F4</gtr:id><gtr:title>Intensification of coffee systems can increase the effectiveness of REDD mechanisms</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Agricultural Systems</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/846e2e2dc482d4ef8cdb715ab7cfbc2b"><gtr:id>846e2e2dc482d4ef8cdb715ab7cfbc2b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Noponen M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56d84d7c9e7330.23725425</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>142EE4DB-0D63-42B9-9275-3355DC03D1ED</gtr:id><gtr:title>Supporting Ecosystem Services in Fairtrade Value Chains</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d2ab0c4042be1f23c00ffacece22d020"><gtr:id>d2ab0c4042be1f23c00ffacece22d020</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Haggar J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5460d8c8442c62.65865248</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8542636F-B47A-4856-92D0-952195FB5B5A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Environmental-economic benefits and trade-offs on sustainably certified coffee farms</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Ecological Indicators</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d2ab0c4042be1f23c00ffacece22d020"><gtr:id>d2ab0c4042be1f23c00ffacece22d020</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Haggar J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5aa6b2885a4c20.36738425</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4558D0FC-7711-4148-8F5C-FEDA64D6F33A</gtr:id><gtr:title>An integrated framework for assessing vulnerability to climate change and developing adaptation strategies for coffee growing families in Mesoamerica.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>PloS one</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d958b97623a62677e9df841ed7a8b4dc"><gtr:id>d958b97623a62677e9df841ed7a8b4dc</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Baca M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1932-6203</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56d84d7c766f83.60651194</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1ED39EE7-5C45-4D3E-8EC9-13F92CF62949</gtr:id><gtr:title>Tree diversity on sustainably certified and conventional coffee farms in Central America</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Biodiversity and Conservation</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d2ab0c4042be1f23c00ffacece22d020"><gtr:id>d2ab0c4042be1f23c00ffacece22d020</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Haggar J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56d84d7c46afc1.02811818</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9B7D85A3-D776-4052-9641-74720441539C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Sink or source&amp;acirc;??The potential of coffee agroforestry systems to sequester atmospheric CO2 into soil organic carbon</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Agriculture, Ecosystems &amp;
