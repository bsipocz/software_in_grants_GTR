Many see a connection between these violent episodes and the rise of new Buddhist networks and organizations, including the 969 and MaBaTha movements. However, aspects of the conflict connected to religious identity are poorly understood and research on this topic needs to carefully address the ways in which anti-Muslim actions are difficult to separate from pro-Buddhist impulses. Equally important is the intersection between religious identities and gender, as much of the nationalist discourse focuses on the protection of women as a way of protecting both Buddhism and the nation. A critical aspect of this approach is to take seriously the fears and perceptions of different groups to understand how they shape attitudes towards others and towards religious and national identity.

This 2.5 year research project seeks to critically assess and disaggregate the category of &amp;quot;Buddhist nationalism&amp;quot; in Myanmar by focusing on two complementary aspects of the phenomenon: the production, dissemination, and resonance of narratives that potentially justify violence by positing a Muslim threat to Buddhism and the Burmese nation; and the gendered discourse of nationalism, produced through nationalist rhetoric and both reinforced and contested via the perspectives of women who, respectively, support and oppose it. First, what is the rhetorical and ideational content of this discourse of Muslim threat, driven especially by monks? Which political, religious, and cultural narratives (at local, regional, and global levels) do they employ and how do these resonate with Buddhists in Myanmar? How do these discussions reconfigure categories such as &amp;quot;Buddhist&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;patriot&amp;quot;? What are the potential counter-narratives that monastic and civil society actors are and should be putting forward in response?

The second component of the project considers the complex gendered elements of this discourse. Buddhist nationalist agitation in Myanmar has often focused on the protection of women and concerns regarding women's role as re-producers of the nation have motivated laws to protect them from the presumably predatory actions of non-Buddhist men. However, the narratives from women themselves present a more nuanced picture of their threat perceptions and how they see their role(s) vis-&amp;agrave;-vis the religion, the nation and nationalist groups. In drawing on women's narratives, the project will also identify alternative articulations of religious, ethnic, or national identity that might challenge or complicate the current dominant anti-Muslim sentiment.

These research questions will be explored through assembling a database of sermons, speeches, and written materials from Buddhist and nationalist groups; monitoring media reporting on religious conflict; interviews with key actors in the Myanmar government, religious hierarchy, and civil society; and more detailed ethnographic study in particular places to better understand the production, resonance, and evaluation of nationalist narratives.

In the rapidly-changing political environment of Myanmar, the project will make immediate and regular contributions in the form of bi-annual policy briefs distributed to and discussed with religious and civil society actors, governments, foundations, and other international actors supporting these groups. By also analyzing the rhetoric and methods of those working to reduce religious violence, this study can gauge the effectiveness of their work and assist them in crafting campaigns that respond directly to the logic employed by those who are spreading inter-religious strife.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Since 2012, the P-I's research on Buddhism and politics has been consulted regularly by government organizations, funders, media, and INGOs seeking to engage constructively with the issue of anti-Muslim violence in Myanmar. One of the post-docs is also frequently consulted by NGOs and governments on the subject of gender and politics in Myanmar. This project is expected to yield policy-relevant data and conclusions that will be shared with various stakeholders inside and outside of the country through biannual policy briefs and consultation meetings so as to facilitate more effective targeting of programs that respond directly to local conditions and motivations, as they vary according to region, ethnicity, and other factors. Groups that the research will impact include Myanmar civil society groups, INGOs and foreign government bodies (including the FCO and DFID in the UK), women in Myanmar, minority religious groups in Myanmar, the Myanmar monastic community, and the Myanmar government.

Myanmar civil society: The increased understanding of the narratives and dynamics of Buddhist nationalism and anti-Muslim sentiment will assist civil society organizations in developing responses to violent rhetoric and exclusionary policies. By determining the nature and resonance of particular messages among particular groups, the research will inform local responses that can effectively counter strongly-held perceptions, while also acknowledging the roots of anxiety that fuels religious conflict.

INGOs/governments: INGOs and foreign governments have criticized the Myanmar government and supported values of religious pluralism. Yet, an inadequate understanding of the motivating factors behind the violence as well as of the ways in which nationalist arguments draw more on Buddhist culture and identity than doctrine has meant that international engagement has often been more of a hindrance than a help and has strengthened an insular mentality among Myanmar Buddhists. This research will help inform their policies as they provide material support for the initiatives of Myanmar organizations.

Women in Myanmar: By focusing on women's experiences and perspectives and taking seriously their narratives about their position in society, this study will give voice to communities whose concerns are often unarticulated or unacknowledged in discussions of religion and nationalism. The study will highlight women's diverse perspectives in all of its consultation work.

Minority/persecuted religious groups in Myanmar: Most of the violence in recent years has been directed against Muslims in Myanmar (especially the Rohingya), although Buddhists have suffered as well and Christians have been persecuted in years past. By orienting research findings in ways that encourage more effective policy and civil society responses, this project will seek to minimize outbreaks of religious violence. In developing an understanding of the roots of religious intolerance, it will also contribute to efforts to build inter-communal understanding and coexistence.

Myanmar monastic community: The monastic community has found itself defending both Buddhism (in its view) and its actions undertaken in defense of Buddhism; the global reputation of Buddhism in Myanmar has certainly suffered as a result. By engaging with monks in the research and consultation processes, this project will foster a more constructive and inclusive discussion over the defense of Buddhism and the relationship of religion to gender citizenship. It will also seek to empower and amplify the arguments of those monks who oppose religious discrimination and exclusion.

Myanmar government actors: The Myanmar government has been heavily criticized for its unsatisfactory response to continued inter-communal violence. This research should help inform government policies that effectively counter incendiary religious rhetoric and insulate communities against future outbreaks of violence.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>482945</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N015126/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DB058E35-DBAD-4B21-B030-5C3C78825B11</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Area Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>020361E1-B8CA-49FD-9149-27D31D21C7A3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FE33AE51-7085-4BCA-8B2F-66C86B855F25</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Theology, divinity &amp; religion</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8E63C4A9-31AC-4950-BF4C-643F945B707F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Asian &amp; Middle Eastern Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6C5D7CC6-5D62-4435-892C-B1063F021A04</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Buddhism</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AE63480E-6C03-439A-99F3-2BBCEC64D6A5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Econ, Pol &amp; Env Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5BAFFA07-4055-4FE0-BE2D-FF47ECC4B6BF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Politics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>D640D1B8-B141-4DFC-BCD3-CEADD848A918</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>GCRF</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
