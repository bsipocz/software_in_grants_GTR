Most firms sell intermediate products. Intermediate product markets differ from final product markets. Differences include the greater sophistication of the buyers, the large order-size of the transactions, and the fact that the buyers are often in competition with each other in the final product market. These differences affect the relationship between buyers and sellers: buyers in an intermediate goods market are more likely to negotiate over prices, rather than take prices as given, compared to final customers. As a result, prices (for the same product) are more likely to vary across buyers---a practice known as price discrimination; e.g. buyers in different locations, or with different order size, end up paying different prices per unit. 
A good understanding of intermediate goods market competition matters. Economic theory tells us the competitive behaviour of intermediate firms affects the efficiency of the supply chain, the distribution of profits, and the effectiveness of horizontal competition at any stage in the chain. Intermediate firms are treated differently in competition policy. The desire to protect small downstream firms has led to prohibition of price discrimination in some countries. In merger policy, the presence of large buyers can be used as an argument favouring upsteam merger. 
Despite its importance, there has been very little empirical analysis of intermediate goods market competition. This is in contrast to (i) the recently developed theoretical literature and (ii) the large empirical literature on prices to final consumers. Research that fills this gap is likely to have a high impact. The lack of empirical work on intermediate pricing can be readily explained: prices to final consumers are typically public, but prices to downstream firms are not (they are negotiated privately with each buyer).
We aim to study intermediate pricing empirically using a unique dataset of transactions for intermediate products. We have three principal objectives. First, to build up the (currently scant) evidence base on competition in intermediate markets, by comparing the predictive performance of alternative theoretical models. Second, to estimate specific models of competition that allow us to evaluate counterfactual policy and draw conclusions for competition policy, on topics such as price discrimination and mergers. Third, to develop new quantitative techniques suited for data from intermediate goods markets.
We use data from a specific industry, the established practice in empirical analysis of competition. The data combine transaction and cost data for the four largest UK brick manufacturers. More than 2 million transaction records contain prices, volumes, brick characteristics, manufacturing plant (location), and delivery location, for the period 2001-06. Our preliminary work has found interesting patterns of price discrimination, depending on the sizes and locations of buyers.
We have three broad research questions. First, which theoretical models of intermediate pricing are supported by the data? Second, how important are the pricing effects predicted? Third, the evaluation of policy counterfactuals: e.g., given the theoretical model that describes pricing, would prohibition of price discrimination by upstream firms intensify or soften competition?
To guarantee a robust research approach we employ two research methods: non-structural regression analysis and structural modelling. We see these as complementary; each exploits alternative features in the data. The choice of research methods is driven by the aim of delivering analysis that is both empirically robust and theoretically interpretable. This will ensure that we address the evidence gap in the literature on pricing in intermediate goods markets in a credible way that makes the greatest impact on academic and policy audiences.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>There are many reasons to be interested in vertical relationships. Through their incentive effects on pricing and investment they determine the total economic surplus in a supply chain in the short and long run. Vertical relationships in an industry also determine the distribution of the surplus to different groups along the supply chain, from upstream producers through to final consumers. As a result there are many vertical sectors - from agriculture and manufacturing to retailing and consumers - that have an interest. 
One reason we expect a high impact is that there has been little empirical work on intermediate goods markets, and few tools for such analysis. Noting the shortage Davis (2010, p503) writes &amp;quot;the empirical analysis of such markets is not very accessible to basic (i.e. academic) researchers since [...the contractual relationships...] are often unobserved by the academic community. The consequence has been less empirical research on these topics overall&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;the set of tools available for empirical research is modest&amp;quot;. We aim to fill this gap.
The practice of public policy towards supply chains is the job of competition authorities such as the Competition and Markets Agency (CMA), formerly the Competition Commission (CC), in the UK, the EC's Directorate General for Competition (DG Comp), and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in the US. Vertical relationships have been at the heart of many cases, including merger inquiries, such as the Universal / EMI merger considered by the DG Comp and the FTC (2012), and general market inquiries, such as the CC inquiry into UK grocery retailing (2008). The joint merger guidelines (2010, para 5.9.1 - 5.9.8) of the CC and Office of Fair Trading list relative market power as an important line of inquiry: &amp;quot;Do buyers [...] have the ability to prevent the exercise of market power by their suppliers'&amp;quot;? Similarly, the CC's market investigation guidelines (2013, para 176) note that &amp;quot;much depends on the relative importance to each buyer and supplier of its business with the other party&amp;quot;. 
In reaching decisions, economists at competition authorities employ theoretical and empirical analysis. The role of data analysis is particularly important. This is in part because results in the theoretical literature are sensitive to modelling assumptions, so that empirical analysis is needed to justify assumptions, and in part because of the increasing availability to competition authorities of datasets of transactions between sellers and buyers. 
The data used in this project are an example, assembled for the CC inquiry (2007) into the merger of two UK brick manufacturers. Other examples are the CC's market investigations into grocery retailing (2008) and private healthcare (2014). The current approach by competition authorities to transaction data is relatively limited, because of the lack of tried-and-tested knowledge (from academic studies and past practice) in how to analyse such data. 
The project contributes on two levels. First, by empirically interrogating the data, it identifies which theories of transactions have empirical support, in a specific merger case. This is of general interest as the methodological approach shows how to compare the predictions of competing theories using transaction data. The project thus provides a roadmap for practitioners selecting the appropriate theoretical framework for analysis. Second, the methodological advances in the estimation of structural models enhance `best practice', providing competition practitioners with a tried-and-tested econometric strategy for better use of transactions data. 
More indirect beneficiaries of the project are interest groups who participate in the supply chain, and economic consultancies and competition law firms who represent firms that are in dialogue with competition and other governmental authorities.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>238290</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Engagement with Competition and Markets Authority</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3BFE601C-2BFD-49BF-9141-DC081B206414</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The activity was a workshop day at the Competition and Markets Authority.
