This is in part the result of the collapse of those certainties which had sustained the post-war political consensus as well as peoples' everyday lives since 1945. But it is not simply a product of the nostalgia for the East, or 'Ostalgie', which has brought a new word into the German language. We are also witnessing a much more significant renegotiation of history that involves re-evaluating what has been suppressed or silenced in the drive for progress. A key example is Communism: the 'spectre' upon which East Germany was founded; another is the socialist state it inspired: now itself a spectre that haunts contemporary capitalism as unrealised aspiration, trauma or travesty. \n\nThis project examines how the GDR and its legacy are remembered in the Berlin Republic. It analyses how, alongside the official public culture of remembrance, 'un-accommodated' or taboo aspects of that past have manifested themselves in the form of spectres, ghosts, revenants, phantoms, vampires, 'doppelg&amp;auml;nger' and the undead in the literature, film and culture of the united Germany. Traditionally, the appearance of a revenant has been interpreted as the sign of unfinished business: a disturbance in the symbolic, moral or epistemological order, which is resolved once the ghost has delivered its message. However, in this context the widespread appearance of spectres can be read as the symptom of a profound crisis.\n\nUsing the spectre as a specific focus, the project addresses works of the last two decades by major and lesser-known artists in which revenants of various kinds play a central role: analysing the 'haunted subject' of post-Wende Germany; the spectral topographies of the united Germany; the phantoms of tradition; and the unobserved but observing the 'spooks' of the secret police. Three case tudies then present major writers whose sustained engagement with phantoms offers ways into considering tradition, aesthetics and the business of writing itself (Christa Wolf, Volker Braun, Heiner M&amp;uuml;ller). \n\nBut, at a second level, the project draws on deconstruction, psychoanalysis and cultural philosophy to tap into larger issues of melancholia, mourning, memory, generational transfer and German history: that is, the way the past 'haunts' the present at a metaphorical level. It analyses the way that phantoms of a specifically GDR past also mobilise other acute histories and intertexts (including the paradigmatic spectre of Hamlet), in order to ask what the return of the dead means for contemporary German society. \n\nThroughout the ghosts are interrogated for what they tell us (or conceal) about the past: through nostalgia, trauma, unfulfilled aspiration or ideological critique, but also for what they express about the state of German culture today. The project addresses three further linked questions. It analyses the 'ethics' of a dialogue with the dead; it examines the possibilities and limitations of what might be called a 'spectral aesthetic'; and finally, it asks what this specific case study can contribute to studies of what cultural critics are calling the 'spectral turn'. \n\nIn this way it demonstrates that the figure of the revenant presents a particular challenge to the cultural amnesia of the present, serving as a reminder of the extent to which significant histories can be overwritten in the dominant political interest. In this it feeds into widespread debates in cultural philosophy which address the end of utopia, the future of Marxism or the significance of post-secularism in contemporary thought. It also contributes to a discussion of concerns of perennial importance in any society at any time: loss, memory and mourning. Finally, it aims to show that, in cultural terms, the return of the dead, perversely perhaps, offers a vital sign of life.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Spectres of the GDR will appeal first to those engaged in a scholarly way with GDR Studies or the Berlin Republic. However, given its topicality, the focus in part on well-received films (Das Leben der Anderen, Goodbye, Berlin!), and its theoretical underpinning, it will also have a crossover readership: appealing to those colleagues in cognate subjects and the general reader with an interest in culture, memory and in ghosts. With an eye to this, the monograph will be written in a rigorous yet lively style with quotations in English and numerous illustrations, which will ensure an attractive book with the widest appeal. Publication with OUP will secure wide dissemination beyond the academy and publicity beyond German Studies. \n\nImpacts include:\n1. Deepening the quality of contemporary interdisciplinary discussion about memory culture in the Berlin Republic by drawing attention to the GDR background feeding into it and highlighting the role of literature and film in that process.\nEngaging public audiences has always been part of my agenda and I already have a prominent public and media profile which will be brought to bear on this project. I have already spoken on post-unification literature at an invited interdisciplinary panel discussion at the ESMT, Berlin, and was part of a live radio discussion from Berlin for BBC R3 with Stephan Aust and Ingo Schulze (an author featured in the monograph) on November 9 2009. In January 2010 I also initiated a panel discussion on literature and politics since unification at a literary festival in London. I fully expect this volume to offer further such possibilities in the UK and abroad.\n\n2. Helping to create an appetite for literature and culture engaging with the former GDR through public engagement activities, and so contributing to knowledge and the quality of life.\nMediation of contemporary German culture in the UK enhances an understanding of Germany today beyond the discourses of history or politics and demonstrates the part literature, film and culture play in forming identity. I regularly introduce German writers in the UK and was, for example, in discussion with Julia Schoch and Jenny Erpenbeck (authors treated in chapter 1 and 2) at a Goethe Institute public reading in Dublin in October 2009. Associated with the academic symposium in spring 2011 (see academic beneficiaries) I have also invited Durs Gr&amp;uuml;nbein (chapter 2) for a bilingual reading and discussion along with his prose translator Michael Eskin, which will be open to the public. Issues from the monograph will be aired in a broad public context, and I am negotiating with the Goethe Institute to organise a series of such events across the UK in suitable venues: e.g. South Bank, Dublin GI, Warwick, BCLT, all venues where I have contacts. \n\n3. Advocating literature from the GDR and the Berlin Republic by disseminating it in an international context through translation and public performance.\nMy work on the poet Volker Braun for Spectres of the GDR has led to a conviction that it should be better known in English. Together with the poet David Constantine I have proposed a bi-lingual volume of Braun's Selected Poems to Faber. A series of bilingual public readings in poetry venues across the UK is proposed. My translation is grounded in my research into Braun's poetry, but addresses an audience explicitly beyond German and will also increase public exposure for the monograph. \n\n4. Contributing to high-profile public discussions on the subject of spectres in significant public fora (see Pathways to Impact). \nFinally, in addressing one of the most significant cultural concerns of the moment (see the fascination with revenants in Hollywood, the Twilight or Buffy franchises, philosophical debates about post-secularism), though a specific intellectual framework, I hope to be able to contribute to discussion of concerns of</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>88657</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Bilingual performance of poems German and English, with Volker Braun David Constantine and Karen Leeder.

- 6 articles in refereed books/ journals
- two edited volumes
-5 invited public lectures or talks in a national or international context (New Zealand, US, UK, Germany)
-3 invited seminars in an academic context (UK, Germany)
This have all disseminated my research and provoked discussion and brought the idea of haunting into public discourse in relation to modern Germany
- I organised an interdisciplinary conference on the subject (including participation of artists, writers and cultural commentators). I spoke at this and fed into larger discussions about contemporary spectres in international context
- an edited volume arising from this is in process.
-3 magazine articles/arts blogs for a broader public
-consultation for two national newspaper articles
-invitations to speak about the research on 2 national radio programmes
- an invitation to participate in high-profile discussion with one of the writers featured in my work on 'Europe's ghosts' at an International Arts Festival in New Zealand
- an invitation to deliver the annual public lecture at UK's premier poetry festival on the authors involved.
- an invitation to present the keynote lecture at the biennual Australian Germanists conference GSAA in ANU Canberra 2016 (on two of the authors involved)
- an invitation to appear with experts from related fields on two public panles discussing the effects of 1989 and the legacies of the GDR in the Berlin Republic
- spin off artistic work and cultural engagement in the form of translations of various of the authors covered and these in turn have been presented in high profile magazines, festivals and in book form and also have won prizes. Numerous invited public appearances to perform with writers from the project.
All these have taken the research beyond the academy and inflected the discussion of the work of memory in the media and public realm in Germany and UK as well as further afield.</gtr:description><gtr:id>7F5BC5BD-EF7F-434D-A27F-469FB0FF5300</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5437c147e79975.44970544</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>My research has examined the extraordinary prevalence of spectres in contemporary German literature, art, photography and film since 1989-90. It focusses especially on the spectres of the GDR or East German past as they disrupt the present of the Berlin Republic.
I have examined a number of key authors/works, but also discovered a wide range of further examples that I was not aware of before I started my award. These have added depth and nuance to my analysis revealing especially different kinds of spectres.
I have developed a methodological framework for thinking about haunting within the context of memory and generational transfer.
I have held an international interdisciplinary conference on the subject (including work by an artist and writer). This has led to a widening network of scholars with similar interests across a wide variety of subjects. It has also focussed the distinctive aspect of German spectres, especially the relation to the 'spectre of Communism'. A further edited book will appear drawing on this conference.
I have discovered a good deal more about the spectres of the West German past, which I had not necessarily anticipated especially the spectres of terror (the RAF) and spectres of Auschwitz. 
I have demonstrated that the power of this trope is such that artists from outside the former GDR are drawn to it in dealing with the East German past: that is that younger and or foreign artists, filmmakers, photographers invest in the symbol. 
I have explored the relation of ghosts/spectres to notions of old age and epochal lateness. 
I have translated some of the primary texts that feature in my work and reached new audiences through this activity.
I have put the idea of a 'haunted state' on the agenda in discussions (e.g. in the public media discussions surrounding the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall (2014) and the anniversary of unification in (2015), thus nuancing discussions of generational transfer, memory work, and aesthetic possibilities of engaging with multiple perspectives.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>-I am hoping that the findings will encourage a new interdisciplinary collaborative network of scholars.
-I hope that some of the particular contentions I have made will lead to further research. Two oublished volumes have already engaged with my findings.
- Several graduate students have applied to work with me on topics associated with contemporary haunting 
-I am still hoping that a radio series based on the work will be commissioned and am in active discussions - one potential TV commission (2014) made good progress to the final commissioning round, but was not finally taken up.
-I hope to continue the creative work that has emerged from the project so far and have in mind a volume of translated texts. 
- The research has already fed into political discussions in the media and I hope will continue to do so.
