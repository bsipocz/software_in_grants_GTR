In poor urban areas there is a strong and well established link between the various dimensions of disadvantage and child malnutrition (both undernutrition and over-nutrition). At the same time, there is increasing emphasis amongst civil society, donors and academic institutions to partner with the urban poor living in informal settlements and slums to create organisations and networks that represent all stakeholders. 
1.2 The NICK (Nutritional Improvement for children in urban Chile and Kenya) Project
The NICK project was a three year ESRC-DFID funded study that started in October 2010, based on the above. This study set out to help the cities of Mombasa in Kenya and Valparaiso in Chile reduce child malnutrition using participatory action research (PAR) to broaden stakeholder participation at municipal level to change the social determinants of the everyday conditions in which people live. 
1.3 Aims and Objectives of Current Follow-on Programme of Impact and Engagement
The overall aim of this follow on programme is to further broaden stakeholder participation in improving the everyday conditions in which people live at the municipal level in as many cities as possible in Kenya. A subsidiary aim is to make policymakers world-wide aware of the importance of enabling co-operation, networking and participation as part of a programme of poverty alleviation.
The objectives are to:
a. disseminate the findings and policy implications of the initial NICK research project as widely as possible in Kenya through policy briefs, stakeholder workshops and dissemination events
b. contribute to the growing literature on the importance of community participation by the poorest in designing and implementing programmes of poverty alleviation 
c. examine the barriers and enablers of sustainability as experienced by the PAR group in Mombasa

2A. Activities Proposed
Two policy briefs will be prepared in the first month of the contract: one specifically for the Mombasa officials and one for national policy makers. These policy briefs, together with other supporting materials from the research findings will be presented and discussed at two one-day stakeholder workshops: one national for policy makers in Nairobi to discuss the implications of the research findings for their policies and programming; and one with the original PAR group in Mombasa to continue their contacts and for us to learn about the difficulties of sustaining cooperation, networking and joint programming at the local level.
There will also be two dissemination events at national level: one for practitioners to discuss the obstacles to and potential advantages of implementing a similar process in their own localities; and one for academics to discuss the possibility of research into questions that arise around, for example, the apparent lack of success of the PAR activity in decreasing child under-nutrition in Mombasa.
2B. Ensuring that Target Audiences benefit from Activity
The team will follow up the national stakeholder and dissemination events: 
With all practitioner participants to to ask how they are planning to promote similar activities in their area and whether there are any opportunities for support to overcome barriers to implementation. Where this simply involves further explanation, the Junior Consultant will travel to the area and discuss with the embryonic group; if intervention is required at a higher level the senior consultant who will contact the appropriate authorities. They will also follow up a second time on the issue of whether they are planning similar activities in the middle of March.
With the academic consultants to see how many would be interested in a more specific research proposal seminar, which would be led by the senior consultant and held in March.
With the policy makers to see what support they require to implement a policy of cooperation between agencies at the local level.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Intended Beneficiaries: 

The intended direct beneficiaries are in Kenya and include those working:
1. either practically on nutrition issues either in dealing with under-nutrition among children or on appropriate policies and programmes.
2. or on the importance of collaboration, networking and participation in searching for and implementing poverty reduction programmes

Indirectly, communities and specifically parents and their children in Kenya will benefit from improved ways of working on nutrition and especially the collaborative ways of working; and those working outside Kenya on similar issues will also benefit from the experience of the sustainability (or not) of the PAR group which was very active during the research period in Mombasa.

How Will they Benefit

In Kenya, as in many other developing countries, there is a visible reluctance for officials of different agencies to cooperate at the local level, not because they are not interested, but because of the pressure on their time - nd sometimes resistance to change - from their vertical line managers. To overcome this reluctance we propose to:

1. Prepare two policy briefs (one for Mombasa officials and one for national policy officials) and other materials based on the research findings.

2. Hold two stakeholder workshops: one national for policy makers and senior officials in Nairobi and one with the original PAR group in Mombasa. The former will provide an opportunity for policy makers and their senior officials at a national level in the area of nutrition to discuss the implications of the research findings for their policies and programming; the latter will allow the Mombasa PAR group to continue their contacts and enable us to learn about the difficulties of sustaining cooperation, networking and joint programming at the local level.

3. Organise two dissemination events at national level in mid-December 2015: one for practitioners and one for academics. The former will provide practitioners with an opportunity to discuss the obstacles to and potential of implementing a similar process in their own localities; and the latter for academics to discuss the possibility of research into questions that arise around, for example, the apparent lack of success of the PAR activity in decreasing child under-nutrition in Mombasa. 

4. Follow up these events during January and the first half of February (January is a holiday month) with the Junior Consultant (supported by the RO in London) contacting (by e-mail and/or phone):
a. All practitioner participants to (a) follow up on their evaluation form and (b) to ask how they are planning to promote similar activities in their area and whether there is any need for support to overcome barriers to implementation. If this simply involves further explanation of what happened in Mombasa, the Junior Consultant will travel to the area and discuss with the embryonic group; if intervention is required at a higher level the senior consultant will be informed who will contact the appropriate authorities. They will also follow up a second time on the second question (b) in the middle of March.
b. The academic consultants who attended the research seminar to see how many would be interested in a more specific research proposal seminar, which would be led by the senior consultant and held in late February, and followed up to develop a proposal. 
c. The policy makers to see what support they require to implement a policy of cooperation between agencies at the local level. 

We would expect to be able to persuade at least some of those who attend either the national stakeholder workshop or the practitioner national dissemination event of the value of cooperation and for them to improve their effectiveness in tackling child malnutrition at the County-level in their Urban Nutrition Working Groups. 

Outside Kenya, those in Latin America will learn from the publication of the practitioner/research papers in Spanish.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-04-03</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-01-04</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>74101</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Policy Brief for professional practitioners describing NICK intervention, results of surveys and implications for organisation of interventions to improve child nutrition: six page multi-coloured with graphics.</gtr:description><gtr:id>6338EDD8-B9FF-4371-8CEB-780FC6CBB515</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Influenced the adoption of he Urban Nutrition Working Group model by the National Ministry.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b856921df309.00238887</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Policy Brief</gtr:title><gtr:type>Creative Writing</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Participatory Action Research Group  Mombasa January 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>49669703-C379-4492-BAF0-A509D9FDE88B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>B1: RECORD OF DISCUSSIONS INCLUDING LIST OF PARTICIPANTS
NICK Impact and Engagement Research
Introduction
After successful implementation of the NICK project in 2010-2013, ESRC-DFID through its Impact and Engagement Research call for proposal, it has shown interest to evaluate the impact of the study and how it can engage the stakeholders to disseminate/share the impact with other counties in Kenya through forums and workshops. 

This being the first meeting of the Impact and Engagement Research study, the following members attended the meeting which was held at AIHD Mombasa offices on 15th January, 2016;

Background
The NICK project was a three year ESRC-DFID funded study that started in October 2010 to help the cities of Mombasa in Kenya and Valpara&amp;iacute;so in Chile reduce child malnutrition using Participatory Action Research (PAR). 
In Kenya, the PAR involved stakeholders from various ministries of the County government of Mombasa then City Council. These ministries included Ministry of Health, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Social services and the Ministry of Water and sanitation. The project also involved local leaders i.e. Chiefs and village Headmen while Young mothers and Children under five years being the main beneficiaries of the project. Two informal settlements in Mombasa were selected to participate in the study one as a control (Kongowea) while Chaani becoming the intervention area.

The Impact and Engagement Research meeting
The overall objectives/main agenda of this meeting was to make a follow up on the NICK project in Mombasa. Specifically, it was meant to explore (any) progress made after the project completion in 2013, barriers and enablers to participation in nutritional interventions, challenges experienced and whether/how these were resolved, how lessons learnt can inform other counties in Kenya from the interventions and results of the study. Also discussed were potential participants to a proposed Mombasa stakeholders' workshop to be held in February 2016.
The discussion:
The following are what UNWG members shared concerning the progress made and challenges experienced so far since the expiry of the NICK project;
Esha-County Nutritionist Coordinator: She said that so far as the county, no progress was made by the county in terms of follow up of the project. Lack of partners to support/fund the project activities was the major reason cited as to why the county failed to make a follow up on the NICK project. She said that the county has inadequate funds to implement or sustain any project as the current funds available are only meant to sustain the normal county operation plans.
Chaani Young Mothers Group: The members of the young mothers in Chaani formed by NICK earlier said despite various challenges, they have been implementing some at community and facility level. Hosted at Chaani Health facility under CHW office, they have been carrying out activities especially on farming of vegetables, responding to gender based violence in the community, performing theatres on recommended breastfeeding methods especially during the world breastfeeding week. According to the group, domestic violence mainly occurs in Chaani as a result of irresponsible fathers who cause a fight with their families during meal time. This is intentional as it is meant to scare off the mothers together with the children from eating the family delicacy (Chicken, beef etc) so that the father could eat it alone.
Apart from farming vegetables which sometimes becomes difficult as a result of scarcity of water problem in the area, the young mothers group also engages in TB and Home-base care programmes supported by Kenya Red Cross to create more awareness in the community. 
What motivated the Chaani Young Mothers Group
Several success stories were discussed; however, the group gave the following set of reasons that motivated them to carry on with the group despite completion of the NICK study;
i. The mentorship and training they received from the UNWG members i.e. socio-economic training, GBV training and Psycho-social support training. Also the home-based care and TB training from Kenya Red Cross empowered motivated them a lot.
ii. The health facility of Chaani offered them a place under CHW to carry out their activities both at the facility and community as well.
iii. Monthly feedback meetings together with other health officers (CHWs)
iv. Token from partners like Kenya Red Cross whenever they carry out any activity in the community.
Challenges experienced by the young mothers group:
Despite being motivated, the group however did experience some challenges like;
i. Lack of enough sills and knowledge especially on nutrition.
ii. Most mothers in Chaani work in EPZ industry; this puts mothers in difficult situations as they do not know whom to leave behind to take care of their children. 
iii. Lack of farm inputs (seeds, fertilizers and tools)
iv. Lack of enough county nutrition personnel (staffs) 
Measures to address the challenges:
The following measures were discussed as a way to address the challenges addressed by the young mothers group;
i. The county will look for partners to support them with funds so as to train not only the young mothers group but also CHWs.
ii. Construction of a Baby Care centre in Chaani so that those mothers working at the EPZ Company can leave behind their children in a safe environment. Plans for this still is to look for potential partners to help do this.
iii. Engage in women groups and merry go rounds activities to get small funds that can help the group in purchasing some of the farm inputs like seeds and fertilizers which do not require a lot of finance.
iv. Engage the larger county administrative office in finding ways to recruit and employ more staffs especially nutritionists
Plans for next Stakeholders' forum:
As part of the agenda, it was discussed that there will be a bigger stakeholders' forum on the second week of February 2016 whereby members will be drawn from Mombasa and nearby counties i.e. Kwale and Kilifi. 
Expected members to be invited include;
i. KANCO
ii. Kenya Red Cross
iii. DSW
iv. WOFAK
v. Aphia Plus
vi. Child Fund
vii. Madrasa Resource Center
viii. County department of Health (CDH)
ix. Chief Officer (CO)

xxiv. County Nutrition Officer -Kilifi

Way forward:
It was agreed that initial preparations to set off as early as 18th Jan, 2016 whereby AIHD-Hamisi and the County -Esha to team up and see the invitation of letters sent, venue booked and any other logistics needed for the forum made.
Daniel agreed to help draft the invitation letter with objectives of the forum outlined clearly and send it to Hamisi and Esha for final processing and dispatching them to the invitees.
The meeting having been started off with a prayer, it was absolute that it should also end with a prayer. Caroline Walucho, volunteered to pray and end the meeting. 
The meeting started at 11:30 AM and ended at 1:30 PM.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>574829bae33e91.47408565</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>KISUMU STAKEHOLDER MEETING 24TH MARCH 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>09B7F4FA-4CD1-411E-B25A-3FC9693CB4A3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>NICK Impact and Engagement Research
Barriers and Enablers of Addressing Child Malnutrition in Kenya
Stakeholders Meeting held on 24th March, 2016 at the Imperial Hotel, Kisumu, Kenya
1. Introduction:

This was the fifth stakeholders meeting for the NICK Impact and Engagement Research, although it was the first in Kisumu. It therefore brought onboard various stakeholders and actors from Kisumu County Health Department and various Nutrition actors in the Western region from 3 Counties. The main theme for the meeting was to address the barriers and enablers of child malnutrition and how the lessons from the project can be scaled up. Key approaches towards best practice drawn from the project were: 
c) The use of a Multi-Sectoral Approach (MSA) in mobilizing support and sustenance; and
d) The formation of an Urban Nutrition Working Group to facilitate Child Health and nutrition.
The meeting also sought to build on the draft policy document that had already been drafted by AIHD so that it could have a wide view and input from the stakeholders. 

2. Participating Institutions 
The meeting drew participants from the public and private institutions from the academia and research institutions, NGOs, County and National governments, multi-lateral grant agencies, iNGOs and private hospitals as outlined below:

2) Present key policy pointers into a brief for dissemination to stakeholders to aid in decision Making process; and 
3) Get feedback and recommendations on possible actions in the short, medium and long term. 

4. The proceedings
The meeting started at 0300 hours with the preliminaries consisting of prayers, introductions and opening remarks. Dr. Mary Amuyunzu Nyamongo, once again largely facilitated the proceedings.. 

4.1 Presentations 

Dr. Mary Amuyunzu-Nyamongo - Summary and background
viii. The NICK Project was a 3 year research study which aimed to help the cities of Mombasa in Kenya and Valparaiso in Chile reduce child malnutrition by bringing together a multidisciplinary team at the municipal level in each city
ix. The NICK researchers facilitated and supported the work of this team through three cycles of analysis, planning, action and reflection to stimulate new ways of thinking about child malnutrition and develop and carry out new multisectoral solutions to change the social determinants.
x. NICK therefore aimed to help two project countries, Chile and Kenya, reduce malnutrition in young children living in the urban slum areas of the cities of Valparaiso and Mombasa by providing exemplars of successful small-scale interventions to reduce child malnutrition in a sustainable way by changing the social determinants of malnutrition through broadening community and stakeholder participation. 
xi. Formation of the UNWG which is the PAR Group for the project.
xii. Baseline household and anthropometric survey conducted in Mombasa whereby Chaani in Changamwe sub-county was sampled as the intervention area while Kongowea in Kisauni sub-county selected as the control unit.
xiii. The interventions aimed at improving food availability, living conditions, water and sanitation, domestic violence conducted
xiv. Interventions were implemented by three identified community based groups,that included twinning with and mentoring other groups. 
Prof. Roy Car-Hill - baseline and end term evaluation

? For both moderate and severe stunting and for levels of domestic violence, rates have improved more in control area than in intervention area.
? For domestic violence, this may well be a reporting problem; more attention has been paid to domestic violence so respondents are more likely to report
? But, given that height was measured on both occasions, which could not be the explanation for the negative results for moderate and severe stunting. 
Daniel Lang'o: Made the presentation on behalf of the UNWG Convener on the formation of the Urban Nutrition Working Group (UNWG), Challenges and Successes.

Summary from UNWG presentation:

xv. The urban Nutrition Working Group (UNWG) was formed in April 2011 after a stakeholder meeting held at Milele Beach.
xvi. Preparatory activities before actual formation of Urban Nutrition Working Group included meetings with Head Division of Nutrition where it emerged that the Government of Kenya (GoK) was already in the process of forming Urban Nutrition working groups; planning meetings with the Senior Nutrition Officers (SNOs).
xvii. The UNWG in Mombasa was comprised of members drawn from the MOPHS, Medical Services, Education, Office of the President, Agriculture, Municipality, Mombasa Water and Sewerage Company and Civil Society Organizations (CSOs).
xviii. The main objectives that led to the formation of the UNWG include;

Coordination 
? Strengthening linkages among the nutrition actors in the slums, 
? ensuring actors in the slums are represented in the Urban (slum) nutrition meetings, 
? Data collection, documentation of evidence for urban nutrition issues shared and disseminated more widely
Advocacy - UNWG provides a voice for the urban nutrition issues 
? Documentation and reporting on major nutrition issues in the slum areas. 
? Help pool information to put together a comprehensive case of the actual situation in the slums; and widely disseminate this evidence-based information
Provide technical leadership on the urban nutrition issues including:
? Exploration of innovative issues of data collection
? Exploration of ways to improve the link between malnutrition and other conditions
? Eventually contribute towards defining a road map for urban nutrition

xix. The Key interventions that the group worked on include;

? Economic empowerment (Business skills, Tie and dye, Energy saving devices, Balcony farming and Waste management. 
? Trainings/sensitizations (A number of sensitization meeting were held with the community to highlight the problem of child nutrition and its determinants in the intervention area, Training on GBV conducted, 3 Community groups conducted interventions - these groups also twinned with and mentored other groups
? Collaborations and networking to highlight importance of child health. UNWG collaborated in at least two (2) functions i.e. (Malezi bora -theme for 2012:Together Let Us Fight Malnutrition and World breastfeeding week)
? Contributed to informing policy and bylaws i.e. (Some UNWG group members participated in drafting the National policy formation; Findings/evidence from the NICK has contributed towards justification for the need for policy formulation and formation of Country level working groups. 


















xx. The group however did not miss some hiccups and challenges during the implementation of the NICK activities. These challenges include;

? Attrition of members as a result of some members being promoted and competing work related commitments. This means the group at times had to bring on board new members as needed.
? Managing expectations and fostering ownership of the project to the community members. The group had a difficulty in changing the mind sets of the community members interms of decision making and to learn how to express their felt needs.

xxi. The group apart from the challenges, it also had success or achievement. These include;

? A functioning multi-sectoral group working towards tackling urban nutrition issues
? Growth of the members of the UNWG
? Established working relations with other stakeholders
? Beginning to see improvement in sanitation in some parts of Chaani 
? Fresh vegetables consumed/sold 

Key note Address by the County Executive for Health, Dr. Elizabeth Ogaja

Dr. Ogaja's address sought to offer insights in tackling urban malnutrition whereby she proposed three overarching strategies:
a) Start from the home
She observed that urban nutrition begins with families and the socio-cultural issues around food preparation and presentation. There's a changing pattern in urban areas with families preferring to go and eat out and most of these foods are highly processed and not necessarily healthy. There's increasing overweight even among children as well hence we are presented with true scenarios of malnutrition. Families must change what they prepare at home for their members.
b) Health Systems Approach
i. Service delivery - the scope of our services must tackle nutrition and NCDs
ii. Programs - need to incorporate nutrition under the Programs Based Budget (PBB)
iii. Infrastructure - adequate infrastructure needed including wellness centres at the community level
iv. Commodities - adequate commodities and supplies are required for both over and under nutrition 
v. Human resource - skilled workforce required and is critical at all levels from the community to the referral levels 
vi. Information systems - there is a dire need to quantify the problem at hand especially over nutrition 
vii. Leadership, management and governance is crucial in order to achieve gains
viii. Health research - Kisumu has a lot of research institutions but data and reports have rarely informed policy. This needs to change.
c) Develop a comprehensive strategy and policy hinged on legal provisions to tackle malnutrition in Kisumu in the long term and beyond the tenure of current government

4.3 Reactions and Discussions 
The presentations elicited interaction, sharing of experiences and interest - and the following issues emerged from the audience:
? Need to understand spatial determinants of malnutrition.
? Understand factors likely to influence area based interventions such as education, employment, food distribution and political climate
? There is a need to transform the existing nutrition group of experts into nutrition working group
5. Recommendations and Conclusions 

Key recommendations mentioned in addressing nutritional interventions include:
? Develop a comprehensive strategy and policy hinged on legal provisions to tackle malnutrition in Kisumu in the long term and beyond the tenure of current government
? Map existing projects and projects into a directory of actors and a visual map so as to avoid duplication and enhance synergy
? Form a County Nutrition Working Group using multi-sectoral approach
? Contribute a chapter to the County Health Policy and County Assembly Act
? Outline specific actions for direct interventions
? Reinforce multi-sectoral approaches for greater achievements 
? Strengthen linkages in order to provide outreach services in hard to reach areas</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>574836c561e4b2.62929016</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Programme Stakeholder Meeting Programme Mombasa February 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AFBBE1C3-9869-4050-8305-9A9EF469BA87</gtr:id><gtr:impact>B2a: PROGRAMME

The meeting was started by prayers and general introductions and after that the programme was followed to the latter.




Opening Remarks 

a) Honorable Tendai Lewa Mtana-Mombasa County Executive Member -Education:

i. In 2013, H.E the Governor of Mombasa launched his first policy framework called 'Elimu Kwanza'. This was meant to give good education to public primary schools in Mombasa County through food programme i.e. a packet of milk per child per day. This was to provide good health (nutritionally) and balance diet in order for the children to have excellent education. The next phase of the project is planning to provide vegetables and fruits.
ii. Every child in Kenya requires good nutrition as it's a vital part of their lives. 
iii. Areas to do with child health require multi-sectoral approach as this will help to enable sustainability of the programme. 
iv. Monitoring and evaluation is an integral element in achieving what we always do.
v. County governments are still young in writing policy statements. Mombasa needs to develop a monitoring and evaluation framework backed with data to show the nutritional status of children before, during and after the school feeding programme (School Milk).
vi. The Mombasa County Department of Education and Environment is in need of stakeholders to help conduct research and to develop a monitoring and evaluation framework that will help guide and inform the county on the school milk project

b) Dr. Mohamed Hanif-County Pharmacist (Represented Dr. Shem Patta-the County Director of Health-Mombaa) 

i. The NICK project was a good idea as it empowered community members to generate income that enables them to have access to good health, good education for their children and other social amenities.
ii. The approach used by NICK i.e. Multi-sectoral approach was the best approach because it helped compare health status in Kenya and Chile. 
iii. The Department of health is ready to empower and work with the UNWG in transforming and empowering community members.

Daniel Lang'o, the Junior Researcher of the NICK study started the meeting by giving the background information of the NICK project and what led to the formation of the Urban Nutrition Working Group (UNWG) in Mombasa. 

a) Summary from his NICK presentation:

NICK Background:

i. More people in the world now live in cities and towns than in rural areas. City life can bring benefits for some but rapid, unplanned increases in the urban population and poor governance has frequently increased social stratification.
This has led to the growth of informal settlements and slums where there are much higher rates of ill health and malnutrition.
ii. There is a strong and well established link between social and economic disadvantage and high rates of child malnutrition.
iii. In the short term, food supplements can be a cost effective way to reduce child undernutrition but we still need to find ways to sustain nutritional gains over time by changing the social determinants.
iv. Changing the social determinants of child malnutrition in poor urban areas requires multisectoral action to narrow the gap between the rich and the poor by improving the daily living conditions of those living in poor areas. 
v. Multisectoral actions need to be planned and carried out by multisectoral teams working together with membership from all relevant sectors and civil society (social services, water, agriculture, employment, women and children's rights etc.) as well as local community representatives. 
vi. Devolved (County) governments are uniquely positioned to play a leading role in addressing child malnutrition in informal settlements and urban slums through working multisectorally. 
The Actual NICK Study:

i. The NICK Project was a 3 year research study which aimed to help the cities of Mombasa in Kenya and Valparaiso in Chile reduce child malnutrition by bringing together a multidisciplinary team at the municipal level in each city
ii. The NICK researchers facilitated and supported the work of this team through three cycles of analysis, planning, action and reflection to stimulate new ways of thinking about child malnutrition and develop and carry out new multisectoral solutions to change the social determinants.
iii. NICK therefore aimed to help two project countries, Chile and Kenya, reduce malnutrition in young children living in the urban slum areas of the cities of Valparaiso and Mombasa by providing exemplars of successful small-scale interventions to reduce child malnutrition in a sustainable way by changing the social determinants of malnutrition through broadening community and stakeholder participation. 
iv. Formation of the UNWG which is the PAR Group for the project.
v. Baseline household and anthropometric survey conducted in Mombasa whereby Chaani in Changamwe sub-county was sampled as the intervention area while Kongowea in Kisauni sub-county selected as the control unit.
vi. The interventions aimed at improving food availability, living conditions, water and sanitation, domestic violence conducted
vii. Interventions were implemented by three identified community based groups,that included twinning with and mentoring other groups. 

Rhoda Mbuvi, The UNWG Convener was the second to make her presentation on the formation of the Urban Nutrition Working Group (UNWG), Challenges and Successes.

b) Summary from her UNWG presentation:

i. The urban Nutrition Working Group (UNWG) was formed in April 2011 after a stakeholder meeting held at Milele Beach.
ii. Preparatory activities before actual formation of Urban Nutrition Working Group included meetings with Head Division of Nutrition where it emerged that the Government of Kenya (GoK) was already in the process of forming Urban Nutrition working groups; planning meetings with the Senior Nutrition Officers (SNOs).
iii. The UNWG in Mombasa was comprised of members drawn from the MOPHS, Medical Services, Education, Office of the President, Agriculture, Municipality, Mombasa Water and Sewerage Company and Civil Society Organizations (CSOs).
iv. The main objectives that led to the formation of the UNWG include;

Coordination 
? Strengthening linkages among the nutrition actors in the slums, 
? ensuring actors in the slums are represented in the Urban (slum) nutrition meetings, 
? Data collection, documentation of evidence for urban nutrition issues shared and disseminated more widely

Advocacy - UNWG provides a voice for the urban nutrition issues 
? Documentation and reporting on major nutrition issues in the slum areas. 
? Help pool information to put together a comprehensive case of the actual situation in the slums; and widely disseminate this evidence-based information

Provide technical leadership on the urban nutrition issues including:
? Exploration of innovative issues of data collection
? Exploration of ways to improve the link between malnutrition and other conditions
? Eventually contribute towards defining a road map for urban nutrition

v. The Key interventions that the group worked on include;

? Economic empowerment (Business skills, Tie and dye, Energy saving devices, Balcony farming and Waste management. 
? Trainings/sensitizations (A number of sensitization meeting were held with the community to highlight the problem of child nutrition and its determinants in the intervention area, Training on GBV conducted, 3 Community groups conducted interventions - these groups also twinned with and mentored other groups
? Collaborations and networking to highlight importance of child health. UNWG collaborated in at least two (2) functions i.e. (Malezi bora -theme for 2012:Together Let Us Fight Malnutrition and World breastfeeding week)
? Contributed to informing policy and bylaws i.e. (Some UNWG group members participated in drafting the National policy formation; Findings/evidence from the NICK has contributed towards justification for the need for policy formulation and formation of Country level working groups. 

vi. The group however did not miss some hiccups and challenges during the implementation of the NICK activities. These challenges include;

? Attrition of members as a result of some members being promoted and competing work related commitments. This means the group at times had to bring on board new members as needed.
? Managing expectations and fostering ownership of the project to the community members. The group had a difficulty in changing the mind sets of the community members interms of decision making and to learn how to express their felt needs.
vii. The group apart from the challenges, it also had success or achievement. These include;

? A functioning multi-sectoral group working towards tackling urban nutrition issues
? Growth of the members of the UNWG
? Established working relations with other stakeholders
? Beginning to see improvement in sanitation in some parts of Chaani 
? Fresh vegetables consumed/sols 
Prof. Roy Car-Hill, a Researcher from the Institute of Education from London was the third presenter whereby he gave an overview of the key findings from the NICK study. He concluded that;
? For both moderate and severe stunting and for levels of domestic violence, rates have improved more in control area than in intervention area.
? For domestic violence, this may well be a reporting problem; more attention has been paid to domestic violence so respondents are more likely to report
? But, given that height was measured on both occasions, which could not be the explanation for the negative results for moderate and severe stunting. 
Jared Owuor, a Programme Officer from the African Institute for Health and Development (AIHD) facilitated the session of discussing, putting comments and suggestions on the draft policy document. This session was interactive as members having already gone through and digested the draft were able to raise some concerns and suggestions to better the policy draft. The following suggestions were raised during the discussion;
i. Daniel Lang'o: Counties to develop and sustain multi-sectoral approach.
ii. Hon. Tendai-Mombasa County Executive: Coastal counties have already merged to form working groups to enable the counties provide better services interms of health, education and Development. These groups include the Social Sector Working Group in Mombasa County that has brought key officials from the ministry of Health, Education and Environment. Other groups include the Jumuiya ya Elimu comprised of officials from the Coastal counties and Jumuiya ya Kaunti za Pwani that is comprised of all the coastal counties being merged to form this association that will help them fight their common goals and development plans. The minister emphasized the need to form these nutrition technical forums/groups so that children can get better services interms of good health and education to enable them have bright and healthy future.
Waziri also emphasized the need for the Commission of Revenue All0cation (CRA) to come up with a better formula that will guide in allocation of resources to county governments. Counties do not have operating budgets that enables them conduct and document research. According to the Waziri, the funds will help Counties like Mombasa sustain technical working groups like the UNWG whose operations have not been active since the County was handed over the UNWG in 2013.
iii. Issa Omar, Coordinator, Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Services commented that there is a need for governments and CSOs to sensitize and empower community groups and members on the significance of the urban/balcony farming because in the next 50-70 years, the entire population will have migrated to urban areas in look for better life conditions. 


3. Way forward in sustaining the UNWG in Mombasa and beyond:
Stakeholders recommended NICK project to be a project that has brought enlightenment more so in areas to do with child health and economic empowerment to women. County representatives from Kwale and Kilifi also could not hide their interest in forming similar groups in their respective counties in order to fight the common goals of good health to children and women empowerment. 
In order to sustain the UNWG in Mombasa which has been the main challenge since the group was handed over to the county for ownership and sustainability, stakeholders came up with the following workable plans;
i. Fredrick Mwmachi, the area Chief Chaani in Changamwe sub-county promised to donate a water tank that will enable young mothers have an access to rain water that will enable to continue with farming (Balcony farming).
ii. Issa Omar, Coordinator, Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Services, he promised to work with AIHD hand in hand in order to empower the young mothers economically. This is by linking the group to donors like World Vision, Netfund, 
Youths Enterprise fund, Women fund, Uwezo fund among many funding opportunities that are within his capacity to influence funding to the group. 
iii. Hon. Tendai-Mombasa County Executive emphasized on the need to bring onboard the UNWG members to the county existing technical forums/groups so that the group can be synergized and together with the county forums they could find sustainable mechanism that can facilitate the group to run its activities.
Next Plan
i. Prof. Roy Carr-Hill informed the UNWG members that there are some funds left that can be accessed between now and the end of March that can help the group organize for another meeting to discuss and deliberate more on how the group will be sustained. 
The only thing that the group will be required to do is to send an invoice to him and keep proper records of receipts. 

ii. Hon. Tendai-Mombasa County Executive : The department of Children is calling upon experienced organization interms of research to help the County's department of Education and Children develop a monitoring and evaluation plan for the school milk project same time conduct collect data will form the backbone of the framework.

2. Draw key policy pointers into a brief due for dissemination to policy makers comprising legislators and line ministries in the last week of February 2016; and 
3. Get feedback and validation of key findings

4. The proceedings
The meeting started at 0830 hours with the preliminaries consisting of prayers, introductions and opening remarks. Dr. Mary Amuyunzu Nyamongo largely facilitated the proceedings as the Mistress of Ceremony. 

4.1 Presentations 

Daniel Lang'o: The Junior Researcher of the NICK Project gave the background information, outlining the context, the juxtaposition of social determinants of health with rapid urbanization and the advent of informal settlements and their subsequent impact on child nutrition. He also espoused the concept of Multi-Sectoral Approaches and actions (MSA) as presenting opportunities to address social determinants of health, poverty and challenges of urban informal settlements especially in the context of devolved County governance. The use of MSAs led to the formation of the Urban Nutrition Working Group (UNWG) in Mombasa. 

Summary from Daniel Lang'o's presentation

? More people in the world now live in cities and towns than in rural areas. City life can bring benefits for some but rapid, unplanned increases in the urban populations and poor governance have frequently increased social stratification.
? This has led to the growth of informal settlements and slums where there are much higher rates of ill health and malnutrition.
? There is a strong and well established link between social and economic disadvantage and high rates of child malnutrition.
? In the short term, food supplements can be a cost effective way to reduce child undernutrition but we still need to find ways to sustain nutritional gains over time by changing the social determinants.
? Changing the social determinants of child malnutrition in poor urban areas requires multisectoral action to narrow the gap between the rich and the poor by improving the daily living conditions of those living in poor areas. 
? Multisectoral actions need to be planned and carried out by multisectoral teams working together with membership from all relevant sectors and civil society (social services, water, agriculture, employment, women and children's rights etc.) as well as local community representatives. 
? Devolved (County) governments are uniquely positioned to play a leading role in addressing child malnutrition in informal settlements and urban slums through working multisectorally. 
? The NICK Project was a 3 year research study which aimed to help the cities of Mombasa in Kenya and Valparaiso in Chile reduce child malnutrition by bringing together a multidisciplinary team at the municipal level in each city
? The NICK researchers facilitated and supported the work of this team through three cycles of analysis, planning, action and reflection to stimulate new ways of thinking about child malnutrition and develop and carry out new multisectoral solutions to change the social determinants.

Rhoda Mbuvi, The UNWG Convener was the second to make her presentation on the formation of the Urban Nutrition Working Group (UNWG), Challenges and Successes.

Summary from her UNWG presentation:

viii. The urban Nutrition Working Group (UNWG) was formed in April 2011 after a stakeholder meeting held at Milele Beach.
ix. Preparatory activities before actual formation of Urban Nutrition Working Group included meetings with Head Division of Nutrition where it emerged that the Government of Kenya (GoK) was already in the process of forming Urban Nutrition working groups; planning meetings with the Senior Nutrition Officers (SNOs).
x. The UNWG in Mombasa was comprised of members drawn from the MOPHS, Medical Services, Education, Office of the President, Agriculture, Municipality, Mombasa Water and Sewerage Company and Civil Society Organizations (CSOs).
xi. The main objectives that led to the formation of the UNWG include;

Coordination 
? Strengthening linkages among the nutrition actors in the slums, 
? ensuring actors in the slums are represented in the Urban (slum) nutrition meetings, 
? Data collection, documentation of evidence for urban nutrition issues shared and disseminated more widely
Advocacy - UNWG provides a voice for the urban nutrition issues 
? Documentation and reporting on major nutrition issues in the slum areas. 
? Help pool information to put together a comprehensive case of the actual situation in the slums; and widely disseminate this evidence-based information
Provide technical leadership on the urban nutrition issues including:
? Exploration of innovative issues of data collection
? Exploration of ways to improve the link between malnutrition and other conditions
? Eventually contribute towards defining a road map for urban nutrition

xii. The Key interventions that the group worked on include;

? Economic empowerment (Business skills, Tie and dye, Energy saving devices, Balcony farming and Waste management. 
? Trainings/sensitizations (A number of sensitization meeting were held with the community to highlight the problem of child nutrition and its determinants in the intervention area, Training on GBV conducted, 3 Community groups conducted interventions - these groups also twinned with and mentored other groups
? Collaborations and networking to highlight importance of child health. UNWG collaborated in at least two (2) functions i.e. (Malezi bora -theme for 2012:Together Let Us Fight Malnutrition and World breastfeeding week)
? Contributed to informing policy and bylaws i.e. (Some UNWG group members participated in drafting the National policy formation; Findings/evidence from the NICK has contributed towards justification for the need for policy formulation and formation of Country level working groups. 






















xiii. The group however did not miss some hiccups and challenges during the implementation of the NICK activities. These challenges include;

? Attrition of members as a result of some members being promoted and competing work related commitments. This means the group at times had to bring on board new members as needed.
? Managing expectations and fostering ownership of the project to the community members. The group had a difficulty in changing the mind sets of the community members interms of decision making and to learn how to express their felt needs.
xiv. The group apart from the challenges, it also had success or achievement. These include;

? A functioning multi-sectoral group working towards tackling urban nutrition issues
? Growth of the members of the UNWG
? Established working relations with other stakeholders
? Beginning to see improvement in sanitation in some parts of Chaani 
? Fresh vegetables consumed/sold 
Prof. Roy Car-Hill, a Researcher from the Institute of Education from London was the third presenter whereby he gave an overview of the key findings from the NICK study. He concluded that;
? The NICK Project was a 3 year research study which aimed to help the cities of Mombasa in Kenya and Valparaiso in Chile reduce child malnutrition by bringing together a multidisciplinary team at the municipal level in each city
? The NICK researchers facilitated and supported the work of this team through three cycles of analysis, planning, action and reflection to stimulate new ways of thinking about child malnutrition and develop and carry out new multisectoral solutions to change the social determinants.
? NICK therefore aimed to help two project countries, Chile and Kenya, reduce malnutrition in young children living in the urban slum areas of the cities of Valparaiso and Mombasa by providing exemplars of successful small-scale interventions to reduce child malnutrition in a sustainable way by changing the social determinants of malnutrition through broadening community and stakeholder participation. 
? Formation of the UNWG which is the PAR Group for the project.
? Baseline household and anthropometric survey conducted in Mombasa whereby Chaani in Changamwe sub-county was sampled as the intervention area while Kongowea in Kisauni sub-county selected as the control unit.
? The interventions aimed at improving food availability, living conditions, water and sanitation, domestic violence conducted
? Interventions were implemented by three identified community based groups,that included twinning with and mentoring other groups. 
? For both moderate and severe stunting and for levels of domestic violence, rates have improved more in control area than in intervention area.
? For domestic violence, this may well be a reporting problem; more attention has been paid to domestic violence so respondents are more likely to report
? But, given that height was measured on both occasions, which could not be the explanation for the negative results for moderate and severe stunting. 
Jared Owuor: A Programme Officer from the African Institute for Health and Development (AIHD) facilitated the session of discussing, putting comments and suggestions on the draft policy document. He presented the following policy pointers for discussion based on a version from the Mombasa Stakeholders meeting two days before:
? National and County Governments should mainstream, support and allocate resources for multi-sectoral actions aimed at improving the health and nutrition of populations living in urban informal settlements
? The National Government to expand its revenue allocation criteria to include other fundamentals including health and nutrition of populations living in informal settlements
? County Governments should use and/or strengthen existing structures and committees at all levels to empower communities in informal settlements to collectively tackle health related challenges 
? National and County Governments to empower their officers to continually enable and support communities in informal settlements to practice safe urban agriculture
? County governments to explore and exploit, and locally generated communal initiatives and processes at level as a strategy for local ownership of poverty alleviation and health improvement

4.2 Reactions and Discussions 
The presentations elicited interaction, sharing of experiences and interest - and the following questions arose from the audience:
What were the baseline results? 
Why Mombasadid the study cover all of Mombasa? 
Why form the UNWGwhy not use pre-existing structures? 
How do the various trainings contribute to nutrition outcomes especially Gender Based Violence?
During the project period, devolution took place. How was this aligned? 


These questions were adequately responded to by respective presenters. 
 
5. Recommendations and Conclusions 
Key recommendations mentioned in addressing nutritional interventions include:
? Reinforce multi-sectoral approaches for greater achievements 
? Focus on the changing context of nutrition particularly under-nutrition, over-nutrition and obesity
? Incorporate the ECD school feeding policy 
? Expand concerted efforts on clinical nutrition and management 
? Outline specific actions for direct interventions
? Interventions to target the rights holders (mothers, fathers, caregivers, all those around the child)
? Uniform dissemination of information nationwide to change perceptions 
? Target existing groups to provide nutritional interventions (Malezi Bora etc)
? Champion policies and acts to other stakeholders
