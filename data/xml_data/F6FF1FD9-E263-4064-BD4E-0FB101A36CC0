The study aims to explore what families living with SMA think about genetic screening and testing in order to understand the role and value of direct ?experiential knowledge? in reproductive decision-making. The study also aims to explore whether families living with genetic disease approach screening decisions in a different way to pregnant women from the general population without such ?experiential knowledge? of the condition being screened for.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The research will be conducted in three phases: the first phase comprises 30 in-depth interviews with family members and individuals living with SMA to explore their views around SMA screening, the second phase involves a questionnaire (developed from the interview data) to be administered to a much larger sample of families living with SMA in the UK (aprox 2,000) and the third phase involves a comparative analysis of the survey data with a pre-existing survey dataset exploring the views of 996 women from the general population undergoing screening for Down?s Syndrome.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>My research will offer impact for a broad range of stakeholders and interested parties including: policymakers, academics, the voluntary sector, general public, health and social care professionals and the commercial sector. 
Genetic advocacy Groups, Support Groups and Patient Organisations: Genetic advocacy and support groups are key stakeholders, and will benefit from the creation of a dialogue and debate around genetic screening, through the use of workshops and presentations. It is anticipated that these workshops and presentations will facilitate the creation of 'position statements' by individual patients organisations and support groups as they consider their own responses to genetic screening. The Jennifer Trust will benefit through gaining insight into the information and support needs of its members.Time scale for impact: Years 2-3.
Policy Makers: The Human Genetics Commission and the UK National Screening Committee are key stakeholders in the development of genetic screening policies. The findings of the research will be presented through a written report to be submitted during any consultations on genetic screening, and I will also aim to become involved with their work as a member of their consultative panels. Policy makers will benefit through gaining direct insight into the views and perspectives of families living with a condition that will be screened for which are vital to policy considerations. Time scale for impact: Year 3.
Health and Social Care Professionals: Health and social care professionals will benefit through gaining insight into the experiences of families living with genetic disease, as well as their responses to genetic screening and testing. Knowledge transfer will be attained through the development of training materials (in conjunction with the Jennifer Trust), as well as presentation at professional conferences (British Society for Human Genetics, Royal College of Midwives, Treat-NMD, European Annual Meeting on the Psychosocial Aspects of Genetics and the Newborn Screening and Genetic Testing Symposium). Time scale for impact: Years 1-3.
Academics: Academics in the fields of social science, disability studies, bioethics, medicine and health sciences will benefit from this research. The research will contribute theoretically to debates around the constructs of health, illness, impairment and disability, as well as epistemological debates around the value of experiential knowledge. However, the research will also have substantive, applied and methodological impact in the fields of mixed methods research, medicine, social science and bioethics. Impact will be realised through the production of journal articles, conference presentations, networking activities, an interactive research blog and workshop/seminars.Time scale for impact: Years 1-3.
General Public: The social implications of both genetic testing and screening are of significant interest to the general public. In order to stimulate debate, I will present my research on BBC Radio 4 and work with a science writer/journalist based at the University of Warwick to produce background press releases on my research for outlets such as the Guardian and Le Monde Diplomatique. Through a collaboration with Sante Theatre, ethnodrama (a play developed from the themes and issues in the research data) will be performed with post performance panel discussions.Time scale for impact: Years 1-3.
Commerical/Business Sector: The increasing availability of over-the-counter genetic testing raises questions about information standards within the commercial world of genetic testing. The way in which conditions such as Spinal Muscular Atrophy are presented to potential customers pursuing genetic information is a key concern for commercial genetic testing companies. I will therefore engage with such companies to discuss taking on an advisory role regarding the provision of this information in relation to screening tests. Time scale for impact: Year 3.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>166074</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Artwork and excerpts from qualitative interviews on genetic screening were combined to create a thought-provoking installation around the themes of genetics, identity and difference.

Two key areas of achievement are outlined below:


1. Significant New Knowledge Generated. 

The IF project explored the topic of attitudes towards genetic screening amongst families living with Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA). A unique dataset of 36 in-depth interviews and 337 survey responses was created. The analysis of this dataset enabled the following unique contributions:

a) Empirical Contribution. The study highlighted the ambivalence of SMA families towards genetic screening and the correlation between their views and the nature of their experiences with SMA. 
These findings are addressed in: 
i. 'Population Screening For Spinal Muscular Atrophy' (AJMG)
ii. 'Newborn Screening in an Age of Expansive Genomics' (AJMG)
iii. 'The Role of Experiential Knowledge in Genetic Screening Attitudes' (Health Expectations)
iv. 'Should We Edit Out Genetic Disease?' (The Conversation)

b) Theoretical Contribution. The study has contributed to interdisciplinary theorizing around the conceptual boundaries of heath, disease, disability and impairment, by highlighting the way in which these concepts are utilised in the context of reprogenetic decision-making. 
See:
'The Shifting Sands of Experience' (Social Science and Medicine)
'Screening Dilemmas: Disease, Disability or Something In-Between?' (Bionews)



2. Policy, Practice and Public Engagement.

This award has enabled me to make direct contributions to policy and practice, as well as undertaking public engagement activities. 
Highlights include:
a) Policy Impact. The findings of this study informed a written submission to the UK National Screening Committee's consultation on screening for SMA. My submission was critical to the decision not to introduce population screening at this time. I also authored an (invited) written submission to Nuffield Council on Bioethics' consultation on Non-Invasive Prenatal Testing, and participated in their associated workshops. The IF data also formed the basis of a submission to the inquiry of the Commons' Science and Technology Select Committee's into genomics and genome-editing (Jan 2017). 
b) Practice Impact. This project has impact for those working with SMA families and clinicians. Impact with professionals was achieved through: 
i. A workshop with geneticists/genetic counsellors (Birmingham Women's Hospital) and an annual lecture/seminar with the largest cohort of genetic counselling students in the UK (Cardiff University).
ii. A presentation to staff at SMA Support UK, and an incorporation of IF findings into their literature (aimed at families and health care professionals)
iii. A deposit of one of the interview transcripts on the 'Telling Stories' website, an NHS initiative for genetics professionals.
iv. A paper published in Journal of Genetic Conseling, 'Impairment Experiences, Identity and Attitudes Towards Genetic Screening.'

c) Public Engagement. Through a collaboration with an artist, Esther Fox, an art installation, 'Pandora's Box' was created, exploring the key findings of the IF study. The installation was exhibited by the Science Museum alongside a video interview between Esther and myself. A debate was organised around the art installation, attended by members of the public. Articles were written for publications aimed at the general public.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The IF project opened up new research questions, including: how do the views of SMA families compare to those of families with other genetic diseases? What features of the condition(s) most strongly predict screening (non)support? How do the views of affected families compare to those of people with no prior knowledge of the conditions?
These questions were developed into a follow-up study proposal, and funding for it successfully obtained (Wellcome Trust Investigator Award). 
The IF database will be added to over the course of this Wellcome award to include four additional genetic conditions: Thalassemia, Fragile X, Cystic Fibrosis and Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia. Analysis will incorporate the IF findings alongside this new data. 

The IF findings will continue to be submitted to relevant policy consultations (e.g. UK NSC). Moreover, the data will be used as a teaching resource at Warwick on the following masters/undergraduate modules: 'Mixed Methods Research', 'The Practice of Social Research', 'Genomics: Science and Society' as well as within the medical ethics teaching of MBChB students. Beyond Warwick, the data will continue to be used in the training of genetic counsellors (Cardiff). 
The IF dataset has also been deposited with the UK Data Service to facilitate secondary analysis.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>649D579F-1C9E-410B-95E1-A68054A4394D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56b8bef8b6aa64.86371751</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.smasupportuk.org.uk/full-report</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Submission to UK NSC National Consultation on SMA Screening</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B4F62F50-658A-4957-B9D6-E08AA34085E0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>My written submission to the national consultation was described as key evidence that was used to decide against population genetic screening for SMA at this policy review.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58908dc6ddf993.43061671</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://legacyscreening.phe.org.uk/sma</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Stakeholder in Policy consultation on Screening for Spinal Muscular Atrophy</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C64848C5-F3AB-415E-B8D0-AE41484D2EDB</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>566809f71428d6.86306832</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiF-PvRz87JAhUG1RQKHW2OBDgQFggfMAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Flegacy.screening.nhs.uk%2Fpolicydb_download.php%3Fdoc%3D355&amp;usg=AFQjCNEl6Oyk8bBuKl2LDj9jarirmgzZzA&amp;sig2=8yzEKbbEZAlVfLjgd1h1mQ</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Submission to the Genomics and Genome Editing Inquiry (Science and Technology Select Committee)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D0D9A336-6CD6-4F93-81C9-0CE4FAFA625B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58908bfa4421a6.97395863</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/science-and-technology-committee/inquiries/parliament-2015/inquiry2/publications/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Incorporation of Research Findings into ESRC Advanced Training Workshop (Mixed Methods)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F510159E-0970-4102-9942-706C14924BAD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A two day workshop was developed using my research data to offer training to PhD students wanting to develop skills in mixed methods research.
