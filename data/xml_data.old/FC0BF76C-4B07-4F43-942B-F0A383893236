EQUIPMENT AND SYSTEMS</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/K018205/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Assembly of final products in sectors such as automotive, aerospace, pharmaceutical and medical industries is a key production process in high labour cost areas such as the UK. To respond to the current challenges manufacturers need to transform current capital-intensive assembly lines into smart systems that can react to external and internal changes and can self-heal, self-adapt and reconfigure. This need is dictated by: (1) demand for rapid ramp-up and downscale of production systems; (2) the fact that current assembly systems lack autonomous responsiveness to disruptive events and demand fluctuations; (3) an economics and societal drive towards 'manufacturing as a service'. Consequently, there is a need for a radically new approach towards development of future assembly systems able to continuously evolve to respond to changes in product requirements and demand with extremely short set-up times combined with low cost of maintenance, system reconfiguration and capability upgrade with emerging new technologies. As the level and type of automation changes, future assembly systems will also require a different type of engagement of human operators in hybrid decision-making, monitoring and system adaptation. 

The proposed research brings together a multidisciplinary and multi-sector partnership drawing upon skills from across the University of Nottingham with an established track record in multi-disciplinary transformative research, and industries representing key high value manufacturing companies together with their representative bodies. The goal of the research programme is to define and validate the vision and support architecture, theoretical models, methods and algorithms for Evolvable Assembly Systems as a new platform for open, adaptable, context-aware and cost effective production. 

The research programme will deliver a new paradigm shift in adaptable and cost effective manufacture that breaks with traditional approaches and is predicated on an innovative intertwining of the following foundational research challenges in complex collective adaptive manufacturing systems: Product-Process-System Evolution; Data Analytics; Knowledge Modelling; Emergence Engineering; and Open Manufacturing. These fundamentally 'collective', pillars for a new extremely flexible and evolvable manufacturing infrastructure are expected to shed new insights on the self-configuration, self-organisation, self-adaptation and evolution of future production platforms. Together the pillars will presage a game-changing strategy for industry's ability to respond and solve current and future societal grand challenges linked to retaining and expanding manufacturing operations in the UK.

The research will ultimately enable a compressed product life cycle through the delivery of robust and compliant manufacturing systems that can be rapidly configured and optimised, thus reducing production ramp-up times and programme switchovers. This will lead to increased opportunities for new, small and independent production stakeholders, particularly those involved in the realisation of product, process and assembly system co-evolution. Our approach of building an underlying architecture, using simulated and real-world data to test and populate models, and working closely with industry stakeholders, will ensure scalable and adaptable approaches that will be transferable between different manufacturing sectors.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The programme will benefit two key beneficiary groups: the commercial private sector (large OEMs, SMEs and supply chain organisations) and the wider community. Our work will benefit the national and international commercial private sector, with particular focus on UK manufacturing companies. They will have the potential to engage with new manufacturing partners, enhance the utilisation of capital infrastructure and contribute to and exploit new integrated adaptable resources, evolutionary system knowledge, skills and data sets. Our close collaboration with the industry stakeholders will ensure direct impact across multiple manufacturing sectors. The wider public will benefit from the research by the increased ability of organisations to respond to customer needs and to reduce product cost through the increased responsiveness of systems, as well as accelerated development of new products.

The programme has been designed to deliver early industrial pilot demonstrators, thus although the focus of the programme is basic research with a long-term application agenda, some of the results will have an earlier impact. To meet new demands in the sector Airbus and BAE Systems will apply the results in future concepts of assembly lines for airframes and structures of future aircraft. Astra Zeneca as a leading UK pharmaceutical company will utilise the research to meet the need for future globally transformable and variability controlled manufacturing systems with emphasis on fast ramp-up to full scale GMP compliant production. GE will benefit from applying the evolvable assembly concept for manufacture of future customised high precision instrumentation. The research will aid technology driven SMEs (TQC, Hyde, MAA members) from established and emerging UK industries in implementing a new generation of small footprint highly adaptable automated assembly cells for high value complex products in variable volumes. Module and control systems manufactures (ABB, De-Sta-Co, Siemens) will utilise a new common approach to reconfiguration and adaptation with particular emphasis on seamless integration of multivendor components and devices. Wider industrial impact is ensured via our role in the MTC (Manufacturing Technology Centre) and its membership in the HVM Catapult as well as our joint activities with the Midlands Aerospace Alliance (MAA), who are a partner in the project. Both the MTC and HVM Catapult will provide access to a wider industrial audience and the mechanisms for developing future industrial prototypes at higher TRL levels after the end of the project. The MAA will provide access to in excess of 200 SMEs for data collection and early pilots.

From a policy perspective the programme will provide a national focal point for future research in this exciting topic. Through a series of roadmapping activities supported by the University of Nottingham Institute for Advanced Manufacturing, we aim to produce a cross-sectorial roadmap on Evolvable Assembly Systems. In addition, our existing engagement in formulating future policies and research programmes in Horizon 2020 and Factory of the Future PPP (S Ratchev) will provide the link to informing EU policies in this emerging technology area.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>2151283</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Laing O'Rourke</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Development of EngD project in Manufacturing Technologies with Laing O'Rourke</gtr:description><gtr:id>D2CC7000-CA0C-47E5-8DA4-75DC547ACA3F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The collaboration came to fruition following extensive discussions between the EPSRC Cloud Manufacturing Project Team and Engineering Doctorate Centre in Manufacturing Technologies at the University of Nottingham with Laing O'Rourke (Manufacturing Excellence).

Project Title
Smart Manufacturing for Smart Buildings

Project Outline
Laing O'Rourke delivers single source solutions to its clients and strives to construct all projects using a DfMA approach. The majority of the building construction takes place off site in a modular format and is then transported to site. The current production line aims to automate as many processes as possible in order to reduce waste of materials, improve efficiency and safety. It is in the progress of increased automation where many EngD projects lie.
Furthermore, a new, ambitious manufacturing facility is planned alongside the existing capability, and the research will explore evolvable manufacturing systems which adapt to component/product variation. This may well include scope for the development of plug and play equipment infrastructure where parts of the line could be added or removed on an as needed basis in order to reconfigure the production line to adapt for different products.
The research will also explore opportunities for a step change in the use of manufacturing informatics and may eventually be adapted to work within a cloud infrastructure to be synonymous with other smart systems.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>546205f3654f27.38658223-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Partnership in intensive four-year postgraduate research programme to address key challenges in advanced manufacturing engineering and transform the latest manufacturing research results into industrial technologies (provision includes sponsorship, industrial leadership and access to facilities).</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Through extensive discussions on the research concepts associated with EPSRC Cloud Manufacturing, a potential EngD topic in the application of manufacturing informatics by Laing O'Rourke was agreed by all stakeholders.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Strategic Landscape Activity</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C8A69748-E2B8-460A-9F34-F4C5ABED743D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As part of the initial stages in the development of the EPSRC Evolvable Assembly Systems and Cloud Manufacturing projects, a delegation from the University of Nottingham met a broad spectrum of participants from [company] to discuss the trends, drivers and challenges that face manufacturing in [company], and the technologies and capabilities that the participants felt need adopting to meet these challenges. This sparked significant discussion on the importance of key technological challenges to meet future market/product demand.

Following the initial facilitated landscaping exercise/discussion the outputs were categorised and ranked according to importance as voted for by the workshop participants. These outputs were then analysed and structured into major themes that the identified trends and drives represent, thus creating business cases for each of the challenges. Each business case details the critical gaps and key actions required to mitigate or leverage the business case. In total 10 business cases were identified and are currently being used by [company] to form the basis for their future research programme in autonomous vehicles, looking ahead to 2050.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5461fe7824cc40.27544049</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Research Prioritisation Exercise (Industry &amp; Academia)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B414B1D6-CC84-4C3F-8D58-EF15FC47B037</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Prioritisation Exercise sparked significant discussion. There is a distinction between those aspects of both the Cloud Manufacturing and Evolvable Assembly Systems projects that are perceived as being essential for groundwork and early success. Legacy, IP and security and reconfigurable assembly systems were perceived as being more important at the outset. Looking at the detail of comments, these outputs could be classed as 'enablers' of later project outputs. On the other hand, customisation / personalisation and data analysis, which were perceived as more relevant later in the project, could be perceived as 'applications'.

There was general agreement between industrialists and academics during the Prioritisation Exercise. However, there were two notable differences. Firstly, industry was very concerned with a strategy for legacy, particularly in the early stages of the projects, contributing all of the responses that fell under this theme, which also formed the second priority theme for industry. This clearly reflects a need to understand how to continue to draw from value from existing capital expenditure, and to evolve systems rather than replace. Related feedback reflected the importance of integration, legacy, and exploring and extending existing capabilities. 

Secondly, while there were a high number of both short and long term objectives attributed to self-learning and adapting assembly from the group overall, cyber-physical systems arose as the most prominent category. This reflects an acknowledgement that rather than a pure research concept of totally autonomous assembly, industry stakeholders are conscious of how technology will be used in combination with human supervision and integration.

Overall, the thematic analysis points to a need to demonstrating capabilities and essential enablers early in both projects, moving to applications later in the project timescales.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5463cb83d962f9.70642833</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Participants in your research and patient groups</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>EPSRC Projects Annual industrial meeting</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5EF00042-62D3-482D-855B-160E80ADB28D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>To inform project partners and other industrial collaborators of progress within the EPSRC Cloud Manufacturing and Evolvable Assembly Systems projects, and obtain feedback on progress to date and future directions.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>589322d6f34129.51165601</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015,2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Showcase for Future Automated Aerospace Assembly Demonstrator</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>04937499-1376-4493-B7B2-9F6E0EEBCD8E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The event was to showcase the University's new &amp;pound;1.5 million Future Automated Aerospace Assembly Demonstrator to the aerospace sector.

Preliminary findings are currently being implemented in early industrial demonstrators.

The programme will benefit two key beneficiary groups: the commercial private sector (large OEMs, SMEs and supply chain organisations) and the wider community. Our work will benefit the national and international commercial private sector, with particular focus on UK manufacturing companies. They will have the potential to engage with new manufacturing partners, enhance the utilisation of capital infrastructure and contribute to and exploit new integrated adaptable resources, evolutionary system knowledge, skills and data sets. Our close collaboration with the industry stakeholders will ensure direct impact across multiple manufacturing sectors. The wider public will benefit from the research by the increased ability of organisations to respond to customer needs and to reduce product cost through the increased responsiveness of systems, as well as accelerated development of new products. Our work will ultimately enable a compressed product life cycle through the delivery of robust and compliant manufacturing systems that can be rapidly configured and optimised, thus reducing production ramp-up times and programme switchovers. This will lead to increased opportunities for new, small and independent production stakeholders, particularly those involved in the realisation of product, process and assembly system co-evolution. Our approach of building an underlying architecture, using simulated and real-world data to test and populate models, and working closely with industry stakeholders, will ensure scalable and adaptable approaches that will be transferable between different manufacturing sectors.

The programme has been designed to deliver early industrial pilot demonstrators, thus although the focus of the programme is basic research with a long-term application agenda, some of the results will have an earlier impact. To meet new demands in the aerospace sector, Airbus and BAE Systems will apply the results in future concepts of assembly lines for airframes and structures of future aircraft. The research will aid technology driven SMEs from established and emerging UK industries in implementing a new generation of small footprint highly adaptable automated assembly cells for high value complex products in variable volumes. Module and control systems manufacturers (initially demonstrated through Siemens UK) will utilise a new common approach to reconfiguration and adaptation with particular emphasis on seamless integration of multivendor components and devices. Wider industrial impact is ensured via our role in the MTC (Manufacturing Technology Centre) and its membership in the HVM Catapult. Both the MTC and HVM Catapult will provide access to a wider industrial audience and the mechanisms for developing future industrial prototypes at higher TRL levels after the end of the project.

From a policy perspective the programme will provide a national focal point for future research in this exciting topic. Through a series of roadmapping activities supported by the University of Nottingham Institute for Advanced Manufacturing, we aim to produce a cross-sectorial roadmap on Evolvable Assembly Systems. In addition, our existing engagement in formulating future policies and research programmes in Horizon 2020 and Factory of the Future PPP (S Ratchev) will provide the link to informing EU policies in this emerging technology area.</gtr:description><gtr:id>C79ECD5E-8FA1-49AD-B122-4BA26329AABC</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>54626e7670da57.72371918</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The Evolvable Assembly Systems (EAS) research programme aims to create a framework for autonomous context-aware and adaptable assembly systems that can co-evolve with products, processes and the business and social environment.

Working closely with our industrial partners we have identified a number of key challenges and research questions that shape the research programme.
