To date, a lot of research and development has been focussed in optimising the LC material properties for displays; however, there are an increasing number of other non-display applications that could benefit from LC technology if it were used to modulate the phase of the light rather than its intensity. Specifically, a dynamic optical element based upon LC technology that can modulate the phase rapidly and with analogue control will be of significant importance in the development of next-generation adaptive optics (AO) for a range of technologies whereby aberration correction and/or dynamic parallelisation are required. Notable advances have already been made using AO in areas such as microscopy, optical tweezing, holographic projection, and laser machining. For example, AO is expanding the capabilities of biomedical microscopy by enabling imaging of biological process in thick and even live tissue specimens, through compensation of aberrations. Such research is now being extended to super-resolution microscopy, which reveals cellular structures an order of magnitude lower than the diffraction limit. AO devices are also used for opto-genetics and photo-activation, where it is necessary to reconfigure 3D light fields at high speeds so that specific cells can be selectively activated. New and improved LC devices would therefore enable a range of research that underpins the life and medical sciences. Equally, adaptive control of ultra-fast lasers for optical nano-fabrication would benefit considerably from new LC technology, allowing pulse shaping and parallelisation at high speeds to be realised, supporting future advances in high-value manufacturing. The potential of using dynamic optical elements, such as LC devices, in all of these applications is well substantiated, but current performance is constrained by the switching speeds and/or phase modulation capabilities of the display-type devices. Increasing device speed will satisfy an as-yet unmet demand from these applications and could enable a greater impact in all of these application areas. Moreover, the development of a new fast-switching SLM with analogue phase control may potentially pave the way to new application spaces that are yet to be realised.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-09-06</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-04-04</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>347003</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>5500</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Jesus College Major Research Grant</gtr:description><gtr:fundingOrg>University of Oxford</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>32E19940-594D-4882-A95C-B23A8EB492E4</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c67670234b97.70788814</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-04-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Developed a new technique for characterising liquid crystal materials that allows multiple properties to be measured simultaneously and time-resolved.

In order to properly observe these effects it is necessary to use an alternating electric field such as a square-wave with a frequency in the range of 100Hz-1kHz. This presents a challenge as existing high resolution techniques require mechanically rotating elements and it has previously is not been possible to observe changes on these timescales. A brand new measurement concept has been devised and experimentally demonstrated. This allows i) birefringence and tilt angle to be dynamically observed; ii) birefringence and tilt angle to be deconvolved from one another in materials in which both properties change simultaneously; ii) the measurement to be completely automated such that a large parameter space of conditions (e.g. temperature, field strength, frequency) to be explored without human intervention.</gtr:description><gtr:id>663155C9-8305-4AC9-A674-0253B8E7C3BD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The measurement has already allowed us to observe extremely small changes in birefringence, which has not been possible previously, potentially opening up new areas of research in understanding these effects. 
 
Now that the technique has been developed, the plan is to measure a range of liquid crystal compounds which have been developed by our project partner, University of Hull. This will allow them to optimise the chemical structures in order to maximise the electro-optic effects of interest.
 
We plan to publish this technique and measurement results from liquid crystal materials of interest to the scientific and engineering community. Furthermore we intend to make this technique available to the research community in general by i) offering to measure their samples; ii) inviting visiting researchers to use the experimental set-up; iii) providing sufficient detail and supplementary information in publications to enable other groups to set up similar systems.
 
It is important to note that this Research Tool is completely general and not restricted to the study of liquid crystal materials. We anticipate that this will become the de-facto measurement technique of choice for a wide range of electro-optic materials and underpin research across many application areas.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c69bef324f29.37378112</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Time-resolved measurement of birefringence and tilt angle of switched electro-optic devices</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>53D9B60A-EC67-46BF-8396-C06DDAE49E18</gtr:id><gtr:title>Wavelength Tuning of the Photonic Band Gap of an Achiral Nematic Liquid Crystal Filled into a Chiral Polymer Scaffold</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Macromolecules</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/62d103499bf572c436778749e87ca85b"><gtr:id>62d103499bf572c436778749e87ca85b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wood S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c672d6868a92.37685292</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>965A3A71-2697-4567-A6B5-52AC45CE1F8B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Speckle contrast reduction of laser light using a chiral nematic liquid crystal diffuser</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Applied Physics Letters</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9136483649763486302634bfe49fd263"><gtr:id>9136483649763486302634bfe49fd263</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hansford D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c67289866cc5.27046562</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AEA4B9FC-FD04-417E-B05A-635CBE3E1D4C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Time-resolved retardance and optic-axis angle measurement system for characterization of flexoelectro-optic liquid crystal and other birefringent devices</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Optics Express</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ee71d2430372e34a42f416b9e661b1b1"><gtr:id>ee71d2430372e34a42f416b9e661b1b1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Fells J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a995b7d231448.13169544</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>48344A9B-72CB-49D6-8D63-E7214717007D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Solvent-induced self-assembly of uniform lying helix alignment of the cholesteric liquid crystal phase for the flexoelectro-optic effect</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Liquid Crystals</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a9936b8e591044b8895d4de1aa6c6394"><gtr:id>a9936b8e591044b8895d4de1aa6c6394</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bolis S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a675d206a2514.36996019</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/M017923/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
