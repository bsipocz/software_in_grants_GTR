In mammals, such lesions lead to complete and permanent paralysis. Successful spinal cord regeneration in zebrafish is a highly complex process involving long processes (axons) of neurons in the brain (which convey movement commands from the brain to the spinal cord), motor neurons in the spinal cord (which grow their axons towards muscle targets and cause their contraction), as well as interneurons in the spinal cord (which coordinate the input from the brain). We have previously shown that severed axons form the brain regrow, that destroyed motor neurons are replaced by new motor neurons and that spinal interneurons may change their connections in order to adapt to altered input from the brain. In order to determine how these different components of regeneration are interconnected, we devised ways to reduce or enhance regeneration of spinal motor neurons. Thus we can ask what the role of spinal motor neuron regeneration is for recovery of swimming, for regrowth of axons from the brain and for connections of spinal interneurons. Moreover, we address the molecular mechanism of motor neuron regeneration from adult spinal stem cells by analysing the function of an important signalling pathway for stem cell differentiation. By elucidating successful spinal cord regeneration in zebrafish, we aim to identify the components necessary for a return of function after a spinal lesion or motor neuron disease from the molecular to the systems level.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Adult zebrafish, in contrast to mammals, functionally regenerate after complete spinal cord transection. This complex process likely involves regrowth of axons from the brainstem, cellular regeneration of spinal cell types, and plasticity of the existing spinal circuitry. We have previously shown that regrowth of axons from the brainstem is necessary for functional recovery and that lost motor neurons regenerate after a spinal lesion. Moreover, spinal interneurons express plasticity-associated genes in the lesioned spinal cord. Here, we intend to characterize which spinal cell types regenerate/undergo plasticity after a lesion using multiple labelling protocols of different cell types in adult fish, in which different interneuron cell types are transgenically labelled. In pilot experiments, we have established pharmacological tools by which we can reduce (cyclopamine) or increase (newly discovered agonist) the number of regenerating motor neurons. Thus, we can ask how motor neuron regeneration influences functional recovery, spinal plasticity, and axon regrowth from the brainstem by manipulating motor neuron numbers during spinal cord regeneration. It has been suggested that mammals are unable to regenerate spinal neurons, because spinal stem/progenitor cells show strong activation of the notch pathway, which keeps these cells in an undifferentiated stage in vitro. We will address the role of the notch pathway for successful motor neuron regeneration in vivo. We have established means to genetically augment (overexpression of activated notch) and pharmacologically inhibit (DAPT) notch pathway activity. With this project we aim to increase our understanding of the complex of contributing factors to functionally successful spinal cord regeneration at the molecular, cellular and systems level. Ultimately, our results may inform future therapies of conditions such as spinal cord injury and motor neuron disease.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>370569</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Helsinki</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Finland, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>PP</gtr:description><gtr:id>06B6E08A-7ACC-4AF0-AD44-CA146447A6E2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Reimer et al., Dev Cell 2013 - see publications</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54624a2a2c1d65.58061398-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Our collaborator, Prof Pertti Panula provided in situ hybridisations and HPLC results to a joint paper.

1. The importance of motor neuron regeneration for functional spinal cord regeneration in adult zebrafish.
Due to the extent of spinal neurogenesis, especially motor neurons, we had hypothesised that the number of newly regenerated motor neurons would be a determinant of functional regeneration. Interestingly, manipulations of motor neuron numbers (increase or decrease ~ by 50%) by interfering with the shh (Reimer et al., 2009) and notch (Dias et al., 2012) pathways did not show a significant effect on recovery of swimming, suggesting the possibility that remaining numbers of cells were sufficient for recovery. This will have to be clarified by more dramatic reductions of motor neuron numbers in the future.

2. The importance of the notch pathway for motor neuron regeneration.
In mammals, the lesion induced activation of notch pathway associated genes is thought to inhibit neurogenesis in the spinal cord. We showed that in adult zebrafish, which do exhibit lesion-induced neurogenesis, e.g. of motor neurons, the Notch pathway is also reactivated. Although apparently compatible with neuronal regeneration in zebrafish, forced activity of the pathway significantly decreased progenitor proliferation and motor neuron generation. Conversely, pharmacological inhibition of the pathway increased proliferation and motor neuron numbers. This demonstrates that Notch is a negative signal for regenerative neurogenesis, and, importantly, that spinal motor neuron regeneration can be augmented in an adult vertebrate by inhibiting Notch signaling (Dias et al., 2012).

3. Plastic changes in different spinal cell types associated with spinal cord regeneration.
We characterised the plasticity of newly generated cell types. Using a transgenic fish in which V2 interneurons are labeled by green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the vsx1 promoter, we found that after a complete spinal cord transection, large numbers of V2 interneurons are generated in the vicinity of the lesion site. Tg(vsx1:GFP)? cells were not present in the unlesioned spinal cord and label with the proliferation marker bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) after a lesion. Some mediolaterally elongated Tg(vsx1:GFP)? cells contact the central canal in a medial position. These cells likely arise from a p2-like domain of ependymoradial glial progenitor cells, indicated by coexpression of Pax6 and Nkx6.1, but not DsRed driven by the olig2 promoter in these cells. We also present evidence that Pax2? interneurons are newly generated after a spinal lesion, whereas the generation rate for a dorsal population of parvalbuminergic interneurons is comparatively low. Our results identify for the first time the regenerative potential of different interneuron types and support a model in which different progenitor cell domains in distinct dorso-ventral positions around the central canal are activated by a lesion to give rise to diverse neuronal cell types in the adult zebrafish spinal cord (Kuscha et al., 2012a).
Furthermore, we found that monoaminergic innervation of the spinal cord has important modulatory functions for regeneration. In a quantitative study to determine the plastic changes of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive (TH1(+); mainly dopaminergic), and serotonergic (5-HT(+)) terminals and cells during successful spinal cord regeneration in adult zebrafish we found that TH1(+) innervation in the spinal cord is derived from the brain. After spinal cord transection, TH1(+) immunoreactivity is completely lost from the caudal spinal cord. Terminal varicosities increase in density rostral to the lesion site compared with unlesioned controls and are re-established in the caudal spinal cord at 6 weeks post lesion. Interestingly, axons mostly fail to re-innervate more caudal levels of the spinal cord even after prolonged survival times. However, densities of terminal varicosities correlate with recovery of swimming behaviour, which is completely lost again after re-lesion of the spinal cord. Similar observations were made for terminals derived from descending 5-HT(+) axons from the brain. In addition, spinal 5-HT(+) neurons were newly generated after a lesion and transiently increased in number up to fivefold, which depended in part on hedgehog signalling. Overall, TH1(+) and 5-HT(+) innervation is massively altered in the successfully regenerated spinal cord of adult zebrafish. Despite these changes in TH and 5-HT systems, a remarkable recovery of swimming capability is achieved, suggesting significant plasticity of the adult spinal network during regeneration (Kuscha et al., 2012b).
In the course of these studies, we found that dopamine, provided by descending TH1(+) fibres, has a significant influence on the number of motor neurons. After a lesion, more motor neurons are generated in the dopamine-rich proximal spinal cord, than in the distal cord where descending axons degenerate and no local source of dopamine exists at the time motor neuron regeneration peaks (2 weeks post-lesion). In combination with studies in the embryonic zebrafish, we could show that the action of dopamine is mediated through the DRD4a receptor and acts through cAMP and PKA on the shh pathway (Reimer et al., 2013).

In addition to the original aims, we have described in a collaboration with a Spanish group, the descending glycinergic projections in the zebrafish (Barreiro-Iglesias et al., 2013). This knowledge will contribute to the further analysis of plasticity after a spinal lesion.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We have trained international postgraduates in the techniques developed by us.
