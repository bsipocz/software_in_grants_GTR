They aim to explorecontemporary and future challenges for caring and carers in the UK as well as ways of improving carers quality of life and those they support in the 21st century. As a coherent evidence base about cost-effective policies, services and interventions is central to these improvements, these seminars will also make a timely contribution to the development of such an evidence base.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Examples of specific issues being discussed are the use of technological innovations, the impact of personalisation on carers, the role of general practice in supporting carers, carers and end of life care, meeting the diversity of carers? needs and support for unpaid carers in employment. During the last seminar a carers research network will be established. This network will progress the carer research agenda with a view to informing the future policy and the nature of investment in services for carers. Although the seminars series is by invitation-only (and is full) details of the presentations, discussions and debates can be found on the seminar website at www.dmu.ac.uk/carers-21. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The primary beneficiaries of this seminar series are CARERS - a group of people in our society who give so much to those who need care and arguably, without whom the delivery of social care might not be sustained. Furthermore as it is estimated they save the UK &amp;pound;119 billion a year (Buckner and Yeandle, 2011), carers also make a significant contribution to our economy. Carer research that has been carried out to date has played a key role in empowering carers, increasing awareness of their needs and driving improvements in their quality of life and health and wellbeing (see 'Case for Support'). This seminar series aims to contribute to the development of an evidence base which can be used to progress these improvements for carers in the 21st century. For example, it should help to ensure that they are adequately equipped to cope with the changing demands of caring, have the opportunity to fulfill their personal, educational and employment goals and are supported to remain mentally and physically well. Moreover, such improvements will simultaneously benefit those who carers support. 
The realisation of these benefits means that there also needs to be a wide range of other beneficiaries. The main ones are listed below, together with the benefits that are specific to each group. Contributions to the seminars from leading figures in carer research have been secured. In addition, the seminars will bring together many of the currently disparate key stakeholders in the field of caring for the first time. Hence, all of the beneficiaries will benefit from the new forum for knowledge exchange, networking and collaboration. Other mutually beneficial outcomes will be an increased critical awareness of contemporary and future issues for carers as well as relevant policy and health and social care interventions. As the planned carers research network will sustain the dynamism of the seminars, such benefits will be ongoing.
- the innovative and unique nature of this seminar seres means that it will provide new opportunities for ESTABLISHED AND EARLY CAREER RESEARCHERS ACROSS A RANGE OF DISCIPLINES ENGAGED IN CARERS RESEARCHERS IN UK HEIs to develop their research potential. In addition to the above benefits, they will be able to develop their understanding of theoretical, conceptual and methodological issues relevant to the emerging carers research agenda and use the carers research network to enhance their profiles. Through its impact activities (see Pathways to Impact), this seminar series will not only facilitate future national and international research collaborations for participants but also contribute to the national and international promotion of, and investment in, carer research 
- the information made available as a result of the seminars and the carers research network will be advantageous to HEALTH AND SOCIAL CARE VOLUNTARY ORGANISATIONS. For example, in both the immediate and longer term it will inform their research and campaigning for improved service provision, quality of life and health and wellbeing for carers and those they support. The carers research network will be invaluable to carers organisations in particular in taking the carers research agenda forward
- the social and economic contributions carers make to our society will reduce if services and interventions do not meet their needs. Not only are carers central to existing health and social care policies but they will also play a key role in the delivery of the emerging health and social care policy agendas. Thus, the seminar series will be useful to GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVES as it will provide them with a comprehensive overview of current and future issues for carers and carer policy which they can use to ensure that future health and social care initiatives are cost-effective. In addition, they will be able to contribute to the future carer research agenda and use the evidence base it develops for policy making at local, regional and national level.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-09-09</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-10</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>15360</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7094DCF3-DA44-42C4-B79A-2B57E8DD1A19</gtr:id><gtr:title>Knowledge generation about care-giving in the UK: a critical review of research paradigms.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Health &amp; social care in the community</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6050b9320453a8e76b95c1ed0a2425b1"><gtr:id>6050b9320453a8e76b95c1ed0a2425b1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Milne A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0966-0410</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56bc58cd2d4e37.53361289</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3EB8CAAF-138F-48F4-8B8E-65829BC8AF9C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Guest editorial: caring in the 21st century: research evidence and knowledge generation.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Health &amp; social care in the community</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/bc1cd6154093ef452fe3615ac7724457"><gtr:id>bc1cd6154093ef452fe3615ac7724457</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Larkin M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0966-0410</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>585d5625a1e827.32938466</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>11A29FA0-AC8A-4044-8479-5B2A3A5FFD92</gtr:id><gtr:title>Carers and Empowerment in the UK: A Critical Reflection</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Social Policy and Society</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/bc1cd6154093ef452fe3615ac7724457"><gtr:id>bc1cd6154093ef452fe3615ac7724457</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Larkin M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d0130139d91a6d</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/J021229/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>ACFABADE-E54A-4FC7-B9F5-259A19D97CDB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Work</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACFABADE-E54A-4FC7-B9F5-259A19D97CDB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Work</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
