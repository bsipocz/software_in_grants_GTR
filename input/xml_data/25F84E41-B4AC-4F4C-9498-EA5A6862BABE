This project is based on the premise that in order to tackle this issue there is a need for a stronger evidence base related to older people that those designing, providing or receiving care can draw on. There is also a need for better sharing of this evidence base and greater use of this evidence across policy, practice, provider and research groups to improve the lives of older people.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project brings together a team of academics, policy-makers, practitioners, older people accessing health and social care provision, and specialists in evidence-use in practice and knowledge media. Together we will draw together existing evidence and generate new knowledge and understanding about improving health and social care for older people, and embed the use of this evidence to then improve the lives of older people across Scotland. These benefits will be for academic, practitioner, policymaker and service user audiences.&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will deliver direct benefits for the partners involved: NHS Lothian, Scottish Care, West Lothian Council, Glasgow City Council and Alzheimer Scotland will benefit from improvements in their understanding of the health and social care for older people, and potentially improvements to the care they provide based on this improved understanding. The project will also ensure that participants in the Practitioner Research Programme (PRP) will benefit from greater research skills and capacity, and improved links within this group. These organisations are very supportive of this project and are keen to use the lessons emerging from the project to inform future developments within their organisations and for the care they provide, and the project specifically involves time dedicated to support the use of research within these partner organisations. 

Beyond these direct partners, the project will also deliver significant benefits to the wider health and social service sectors and to carers supporting older people, by contributing to their understanding of how to improve care for older people, and the use and usefulness of research as a mechanism for improvement and innovation. It is expected that practitioners, service providers and policy-makers in the fields of health and social care of older people, will specifically benefit from the individual practitioner research projects, the key findings guide and the knowledge sharing events, which will feed into practice and policy debates around improving care for older people, as well as the design and delivery of care. 

The impact of this learning on the wider social service sector will be maximised through the involvement of IRISS (Institute for Research and Innovation in Social Services). IRISS is a third sector organisation with strong links across the social services in Scotland, links which are supported through a network of IRISS 'champions' across the 32 local authorities in Scotland and a range of independent and private sector social service organisations. IRISS are also one of the partners on the Knowledge Management for Social Service Scotland Board, and can utilise its remit and involvement to further maximise the sharing and use of knowledge generated through this project across social services in Scotland. Impact will further be maximised through the on-line repository for research projects and the dissemination of findings through existing newsletters, new social media channels, events and contacts. All publications will also be made available via CRFR and IRISS's websites, the Learning Exchange and Social Service Knowledge Scotland (SSKS), and highlighted via a range of dissemination channels, including CRFR and IRISS's mailing lists, IDOX, relevant communities of practice, new social media channels. For key outputs press releases will be distributed.

Finally, we anticipate that the involvement of the practitioner researchers from a range of organisations providing or influencing the provision of health and social care for older people will help to demonstrate the benefits of using research to improve and innovate. We are hopeful that those within the partner projects will become a strong network of champions for using and doing research, and through this example we can better demonstrate the usefulness of research to the wider social service sector.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>99738</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>VOCAL Midlothian</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Partnership between VOCAL Midlothian and Midlothian Council</gtr:description><gtr:id>4D01B06A-0565-4DBB-BC34-66CF85022EC7</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b9d92b1eb9d92b32-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>The PROP project enabled a partnership between two of the project's partner organisations: VOCAL Midlothian and Midlothian Council.
