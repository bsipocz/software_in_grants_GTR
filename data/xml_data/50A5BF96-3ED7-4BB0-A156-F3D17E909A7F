&lt;p>These outcomes have now been progressed further and form the basis of this 2012 Impact update. These include: the publication of two journal special editions (rated at 3* quality according to the Association of Business Schools journal quality guide); the setting up of a research network, the Voice and Ethnicity Research and Action Network, VERN, that builds on the findings and networks from the seminar series,&amp;nbsp; and the launch of a dedicated website. Additionally, a VERN launch event has been completed (roundtable discussion format) with both researchers and practitioners in attendance.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>VERN also has established institutional links with a number of research centres including CERIC (University of Leeds), The Fairness of Work Research Group (University of Manchester), Migrant Workers and Action Research Group, Strathclyde University and PRIMAL (University of Paris, Nanterre).&amp;nbsp; Finally, VERN members submitted an application to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (on ethnicity and poverty) and though unsuccessful, the application was shortlisted.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>6051</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Inaugural meeting of the Voice and Ethnicity Research and Action Network</gtr:description><gtr:form>Scientific meeting (conference/symposium etc.)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BEE489FE-1261-4473-9CEC-76B827A5AAAE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The ESRC seminar series was focused on the way participative mechanisms and new forms of representation were emerging in BME communities. It tried to map the way communities and social organisations viewed and responded to participation gaps. 



However, in the past two years we have seen a new political climate posing serious challenges to the participation and networking around equality issues. First, we have a new formal questioning of social and equality rights in the UK disguised in the form of a defence of 'regulatory simplicity'. Second, the resourcing of social organisations related to equality is being undermined within a generalised assault on the welfare state. Third, discourse at the UK government and EU levels have accelerated and are clearly attempting to be a populist attempt at indicating a change in policy on migration. Consequently, the environment has become even more difficult, providing further challenges to both minority ethnic communities and the agenda of social and equality rights. 



The meeting will focus on two questions. First, how have these changes impacted on the structures of representation within - and concerning -various communities? Second how should VERN develop its agenda as a network in relation to these changes?</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-6553193877.0350012b415ff8</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academnic audiences (collaborators, peers etc)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-451-26-0465</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">RES-451-26-0465</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
