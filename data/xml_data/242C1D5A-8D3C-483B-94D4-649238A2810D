It will result in a book entitled Faith, Hope and Charity: Social Relations in England, 1500-1640 (contracted to Cambridge University Press), two journal articles, a symposium, a conference and an informal workshop. Public impact will be achieved through working with the Friends of the National Archives on the symposium and working with TNA archivists in creating new online finding aids, so opening up to a broader public fresh bodies of TNA material. 

I proceed from a deceptively simple question: how, despite the rapidity and intensity of economic and social change (population growth, urbanization, deepened commercialization, social polarization, social conflict) profound alteration in religious culture (the uneven, contested process of protestantization) and sometimes vicious social conflicts (riot, rebellion, episodic political crisis and - in the end - civil war) did Tudor and early Stuart society cohere? Periodization has been carefully considered. Around 1500, population expansion becomes noticeable. New bodies of archival material commence in useful runs from the same time (especially TNA material). Yet with the exception of work on rebellions, research on early modern English society tends to take its start-point at 1560. In contrast, I shall explore the whole range of the period 1500-1640. This will set the agenda for future work, opening up a substantial body of archival material to scrutiny as well as situating the post-1560 period against a clearer sense of what came before. At the other end of my period, the human, material and political impact of the civil wars form a decade of profound discontinuity into which, for now, I intend not to enter. In the long-term, I intend write a social history of the English Revolution. But that lies in the future. 

The title of the monograph draws on 1 Corinthians 11-13: When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child. But when I became a man, I put away childish things. For now, we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face. Now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.And now abideth faith, hope and charity, these three: but the greatest of these is charity.

My title therefore foregrounds the Scriptures as massively powerful yet constantly contested texts. The title does the following interpretive work: 
(a) Faith. Obviously, this alludes to the power of Christian faith within everyday life and communal relations in Tudor and Stuart England. Less obviously, it alludes to the capacities of local solidarities - faith in one another, in neighbours and friends - to weather the storms that threatened otherwise to overwhelm villages and towns. These included dearth of food, loss of rights, infectious disease, high taxation, exploitative lordship and the enclosure of common lands. 
(b) Hope. In an economy characterised - for poorer people - by constant insecurity, what hope was there for the future? Hope is here used as a category against which to situate profound material inequality and political disempowerment, and against which to locate lower-class agency. 
(c) Charity. This critically important concept refers not only to poor relief. It also references the social meanings of charity. Partially, charity was functional: poor folk begged for support on their knees, with their caps in their hands. But charity was relational: poor folk had expectations of their richer neighbours - when demands for charity were frustrated, those expectations could quickly mutate into something far more assertive. The concept of reciprocity is central here. 

All three words - faith, hope and charity - lead us into the unpredictability of working people's lives and into their potential capacity to shape the world around them.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Public impact will follow from work with the largest archival repository in the UK, the National Archives (TNA). It will have the following impacts on the nation's health and culture: 
(1) The online TNA catalogue, Discovery had 15,568,684 visits over 2015. Around 60,000 early modern [1500-1714] documents were read by researchers in the TNA over that period. A large proportion of those who use the TNA are family historians and non-academic local historians. Any improvement of information about the records added to Discovery is therefore immediately accessible to a very wide audience. TNA archivists have noticed that interest in records produced in legal records is growing fast, as their catalogue descriptions are improved by TNA. For example, following the introduction of new online finding aids, the use of class C7 (Court of Chancery) increased from 40 (2014) to 700 (2016). 
(2) Using my extensive body of detailed notes from legal records drawn from TNA material over the last 27 years, the Post-Doctoral research assistant (RA) will substantially upgrade the online finding aids for a number of TNA collections. These include the records of the Duchy of Lancaster and the Court of Exchequer. Working with the advice and guidance of archivists at the TNA, the RA will take my substantial body of notes, summarise them, and add them to existing online catalogues. Much of this material, especially TNA classes DL4 (Duchy of Lancaster depositions, Elizabeth-Victoria), E134 (Exchequer depositions, c.1570-1760) is difficult to access and is therefore off-putting to non-academic users. Yet there is much of interest in the material to such users, especially regarding local history and family history. Classes E134 and DL4 comprise witness statements, typically by quite humble people, in village and town disputes. They provide rich material into local life, customs, social relations, economic conditions, the landscape, institutional arrangements, tithes and the manorial system. The consequence will be that finding aids are created that will endure for as long as the TNA exists (the TNA was founded as the Public Record Office in 1838 to consolidate the legacy of medieval and early modern archivists), creating opportunities for the public to access a series of rich yet currently inaccessible collections. Importantly, catalogue searches and use of the manuscript material can be tracked by the TNA. The project will therefore contribute to the shared institutional memory of the nation in a way that will endure for centuries into the future. 
(3) The research team will work with the TNA and with the Friends of the TNA. This organisation provides creative input into Discovery by creating new catalogue content. The PI and RA will organize a one-day symposium for the Friends of the TNA on the theme of 'Early Modern History and the National Archives'. This will be addressed by leading historians of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries along with the PI and the RA. It represents an important opportunity to explain the project to an audience of non-academic users of the TNA who are also engaged (under the supervision of TNA archivists) in the creation of new online finding aids for 'Discovery'.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>164674</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/P014941/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DCE73056-5E3D-4976-B573-234E5FF4D633</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic &amp; Social History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
