Examples from the extravagant notations, particularly of the piano part, but also the instrumental parts (the clarinet part adorns the cover of Pritchett's important 1993 survey The Music of John Cage) decorate most studies of 20th century and experimental music (the front covers of the second editions of both Michael Nyman's Experimental Music and Paul Griffiths' Modern Music and After: Directions since 1945 are two such examples). Ever since Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg organised an exhibition to run alongside the first performance of the work (which they organised), exhibitions of graphic scores, American experimental work, and other themes associated with Cage regularly include pages from the piano part, the Solo for piano. As well as the innovations in notations, formally - as a set of parts without score, to be performed in any combination and relationship, including with other works - it throws open the notion of open form and the open work to a far greater degree than any earlier work by any twentieth century composer. 
Yet the many complexities, ambiguities and challenges of the work and its notations are rarely discussed in detail. Performances are still relatively uncommon for a work which is regularly cited as being a landmark. On this and other anecdotal evidence it would appear that the 'Concert' is recognised as being of great importance to the history of twentieth century music but how it might be understood and performed remains a puzzle. It is the purpose of this project to demystify the work in all aspects: to significantly advance how the work is viewed and understood and to provide insights and a range of possibilities to future performers.
There are three areas of investigation central to the study:
1. Historical context
The compositional context of Cage's works through the 1950s, as well as the works leading from the 'Concert' into the 1960s will inform discussion of the work, whilst much of the original research will be conducted through interviews and examination of archival material to present close readings of the production, performance and reception histories. 
2. Analytical discussion
Despite the notoriety of the 'Concert for piano and orchestra', for its both historical and musical significance, there is surprisingly little detailed discussion about the music itself, how it functions, and its implications for performance. Discussion tends to focus upon surface features of the notation and then primarily relating to the piano part. This proposed study takes an unique and comprehensive approach to the work as a whole, closely examining and cataloguing all the different notations in the instrumental parts, the infamous conductor's part, as well as the piano part.
3. Performance issues
An important part of the study is to look to future performances, providing information and suggestions for fresh interpretations of the work as a whole and in its various groupings. In order to achieve this it is vital to integrate performers and performances into the project. A wide range of recordings and other documentation relating to performances from the past will be accessed and examined closely. The findings resulting from the investigation into performance issues will be discussed at length in the book. Furthermore, an interactive web resource will offer practical guides to interpretation, of individual notations and to matters of structure, density and continuity. It will allow users to shape new realisations of notations and to 'play' with possibilities. Additionally, professional recordings of each part will be specially made and available through the web-site which will allow for listeners to interact with and variously combine the different parts in modular fashion.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The two largest groups of people who will benefit from this research are:
1. Historians and musicologists with a focus upon twentieth century music
2. Performers
The following groups will also benefit from the research:
3. Students and teachers
4. The layperson - audiences and people with an interest in Cage, either as performers, listeners, and/or readers

Whilst the academic community will clearly benefit from the research, it is the intention that this should have maximum reach to a wider community interested in exploring and promoting the music of John Cage and, more widely, experimental music. The benefits to the academic community are detailed in the 'Academic Beneficiaries' document. Performers, both professional and amateur, are the other largest group to benefit tangibly from the outputs of this research. It is hoped that the monograph will have a direct relevance to the development of performance practice and act as a suitable point of reference for anyone wishing to understand how the work functions as the micro and macro levels. The book has been proposed to Oxford University Press, whose Studies in Musical Genesis, Structure &amp;amp; Interpretation series is generally less expensive than many scholarly volumes ensuring the possibility of a wider audience than is the norm for scholarly output. Suzanne Ryan of OUP has stated that it is a volume that they would like pursue and once sample chapters are available to follow the initial book proposal, the investigators are confident that a contract will be issued.
The interactive website is an innovative and practical means of exploring how the notations work, how they might sound and be realized, and what the potential of each notation and the work as a whole might be. There is no doubt that, no matter how well-known the work is, its many ambiguities, challenges and complexities serve to dissuade people from engaging with and performing the work. The aim of the website is to remove many of these obstacles and provide real examples of how the notations may be realised, drawing upon sources from other pianists and instrumentalists, as well as structures that will enable new realisations to be created.
Whilst this is in part aimed at enabling more and more varied performances of the work, its aim is also to provide a learning tool for students, amateurs and the layperson to engage with Cage's procedures and the work itself. It is hoped that it may serve as a model for more innovative means of engaging with such indeterminate works in the future. Thomas's work on the Peters Edition educational handbook to performing Cage - aimed at schools and Further/Higher Education institutions and supported by Cage's publishers and the John Cage Trust - serves as a strong base from which this website will draw to make the environment an accessible one for the widest possible variety of user. It is the intention to promote the website through a variety of means, but particularly in schools, colleges and Higher Education institutions internationally, working with Peters Edition and the John Cage Trust. Links to the website, as well as extra video documentation of performances and presentations, will be highlighted through the University's presence on iTunesU, which is developing significantly over 2014-15 and which increases the reach of research projects such as this outside of the academic context.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-10-11</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-10-12</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>513751</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>2880</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>USD</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>Ecuador</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>es_EC</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>John Cage Collection Research Grant</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-10-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Northwestern University Chicago</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>6FA53F85-7037-4894-8505-2313E1021CCA</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58a5fc7dc24b17.41299117</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-09-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>2150</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>Unknown</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>USD</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>Ecuador</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>es_EC</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Getty Library Research Grant</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>The Getty Foundation</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>B9418BAB-525E-4A96-8F6B-CD03553BAE41</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58a5fd2122e185.18600979</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-09-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/M008444/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>0AEFDABE-67A4-48B1-9DB4-99393BDE6065</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Music</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>47D79871-3D9E-42F7-83E1-354D081901C7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Classical Music</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A13304AD-8058-4333-86C7-DB798216A696</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Composition</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8F220D14-A48F-413D-9D9E-0756C51CE2B0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History Of Music</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>55773495-BB0B-43EB-B99D-D5C15272A52F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Musical Performance</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>120E89AC-386D-4E25-9417-A3FE4D6FE83A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Musicology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
