However many individuals that do not engage in programming will purchase and use such applications. In contrast to these visible boxes , embedded computers hidden within appliances such as fridges and washing machines traditionally cannot be programmed by users. They are also used extensively in cars for engine control and supplementing breaking and steering. They are essentially invisible. However as computers become more powerful and cheaper we are witnessing a merging of these philosophies . Mobile phones contain computers which are both hidden and programmable with downloadable apps . There is now the potential to go further and make computers embedded in (say) appliances programmable after they are in place.Advances in communications now allow such computers to be linked together. They become networked computers . So screens on fridges can show web pages, cars can communicate speed and speed history to each other, and a mobile phone can control the lights in your home.In addition small cheap sensors, often with their own small computers are being developed. Small cheap actuators are also appearing. Actuators might simply switch lights on and off, but they can also control the flow of fuel to an engine. They too can communicate with each other. So in addition to sensing the environment, computer systems can use actuators to control and change it. But how is this control exercised? It may be manual so a user on a wireless PDA might set the temperature of the home central heating. However there is much excitement in the research community in how an array of networked small computers can cooperate to automatically alter the behaviour of a system. A simple example would be positional information on family mobile phones controlling their home environment.The integration of these technologies also offers the advent of new applications; in the home for homecare and healthcare; in the hospital for patient monitoring and support; and in the office to boost productivity. This project proposes to inform the public about this potent mix of technologies and explain the importance of their integration. We will develop a highly interactive show in partnership with the Glasgow Science Centre to be presented to large audiences through its Science Show programme. We want to describe the technologies, and use recent research work to show the audience the potential possibilities of their integration, and how this will radically alter the way we think about and use computers. To support the show we will provide additional, more detailed material for educational use and for those who wish to explore the topic further. While conventional web based interfaces will be used, we expect to have a presence in YouTube and also to explore newer virtual worlds such as Second Life. The project is being carried out by two universities, Glasgow and Stirling and each brings essential and compatible aspects to the project. Glasgow offers experience in effective public engagement, and evaluation, while Stirling will bring the research drive and technological expertise. The two groups have already collaborated together and with Glasgow Science Centre on successful PE and research projects.We plan to carry out the work in three phases. In the first three month phase we will design the show in detail. Once this is in place, the equipment will be assembled and the necessary software developed. This second phase will last just 9 months as existing research prototypes can be used as a base. In the final 4 month phase the show will be evaluated and refined using the Science Centre Theatre with audiences. Training of Science Centre staff will also take place in this phase. It is also at this stage that the Science Centre will take over the regular delivery of the show for both their regular in-house shows and to their external outreach programme</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The planned method for delivering effective and sustainable public engagement impact is an interactive science show in combination with drama and supporting web based materials for public and educational use. Who will benefit? -At Public events this will be children, families, adults, and young adults -At School events this will be pupils, teachers, and Education authorities -The participant organisations: Glasgow Science centre (GSC), Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama (RSAMD), Universities of Stirling and Glasgow -Government and policy makers How will they benefit? For those attending the shows, benefits will be to: -experience and engage effectively with new emerging computer and communication technology -reflect upon the usability and applicability of the technology -be aware of possible future applications of the technology and how these might impact on daily life -consider and form their own opinions and perceptions about the acceptability of the technology now and in future -record their opinions, hopes, or concerns in an anonymous and/or personal way (via EVS, on-line questionnaire, or message board) -access to further information through a dedicated web site about the research and its applications The Education community will have the benefits above and in addition: -pupils will engage in preparation and follow up activities providing a richer and deeper experience -teachers will benefit from a comprehensive multi-disciplinary learning package with explicitly stated curriculum links and suitable for use in computing/ICT, or personal and social education -education authorities will benefit from exemplar education materials to which schools can be directed. The material will be particularly suitable for the new Curriculum for Excellence implementation in Scottish schools. Benefits to participant organisations; -a fully developed science show and support materials with a plan for long term sustainability -a collaboration with GSC beyond the lifetime of the project particularly for analysing public and school feedback data. -potential for disseminating the show to other science centres in the UK and for developing further educational support materials to suit other school systems. -closer links between University Science, Education, Arts and Science centre communities with potential for staff and students to engage more widely in PE activities in collaboration with GSC Government and policy makers Whilst there is no direct link anticipated with government and policy makers, a well received PE event with strong public input and feedback can certainly provide evidence for actions and policy making as well as potential routes for collaboration. What will be done to ensure the benefit is achieved/delivered? Overall we consider this to be a low risk strategy with a high chance of achieving the planned impacts. -Collaboration with GSC, an established PE provider, will ensure that; audience targets are met; show and materials developed are appropriate and engaging and the project is sustainable beyond the grant period -University staff and researchers will all receive professional public engagement training to ensure the highest standards in the development of the show and support materials. -shows will employ theatre (video format) to introduce both a technical and social aspects in an accessible and familiar setting. -the show will employ high quality off the shelf and adapted laboratory equipment to address the technological aspects is a realistic way -professional drama and video production in collaboration with RSAMD will ensure an effective introduction to the show themes. -electronic voting systems will be used to motivate an audience wide participation in the show but in an anonymous and non-threatening way -additional web-based information for schools and the public will provide further opportunities engagement with the subject matter and a forum for feedback and discussion</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>19902</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/H047395/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6E910789-6B8D-4B73-B5B0-F3156942B558</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Geosciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D4F391DF-BCE0-47FA-BED7-78025F16B14D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Hydrological Processes</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
