PES scheme in the South West. This will include a review of academic literature on the establishment of multiple benefit PES schemes, adapted to the context of SWW. It will also include a comparative analysis of multiple benefit PES case studies to identify features that could be translated into the SWW context, including field visits to case studies where necessary to find out more about their work.

Work Package 2 (objective 2): The intern will use existing GIS based analyses of the restoration-potential at different sites to deliver water quality, quantity and carbon to develop tools that can identify where restoration is likely to deliver greatest economic advantage to SWW and land managers (for example, targeting pockets of land that may pose a risk to local water abstraction). Research currently being undertaken between SWW and University of Exeter will feed into the calculation of likely economic benefits.

Work Package 3 (objective 3): In collaboration with IUCN, water@leeds and Mark Reed, the intern will: i) identify potential co-benefits associated with peatland restoration in relevant SWW catchments; ii) identify methods (including indicators and proxies) for quantifying co-benefits and potential risks where this is possible; iii) compare the merits of bundling carbon and other co-benefits with payments for clean water under the Upstream Thinking project versus layering1 a separate carbon scheme on top of the existing Upstream Thinking scheme; 
 iv) identify likely investors in the multiple benefit PES scheme, and any factors that could help target future marketing of the scheme (possibly including focus group(s) to get more in depth feedback from potential investors, professional advisors and beneficiaries of the scheme); 
v) identify scheme accreditation options e.g. under the UK Peatland Carbon Code versus the Voluntary Carbon Standard, and in relation to OFWAT requirements; and vi) develop a methodological framework for scheme implementation, showing how key operational tasks fit together.

Work Package 4 (objective 4): i) sharing findings from Work Packages 1-3 with the group led by IUCNwho are developing standards and protocols for the UK Peatland Carbon Code; and ii) working closely with members of the IUCN advisory science panel, and with advice from Mark Reed, translate emerging technical guidance on peatland restoration and monitoring into the South West context, providing feedback on practicability of the guidance.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>19500</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Introduction
Land managers face increasing demands to manage the countryside for many different purposes,
many of which have historically been taken for granted. Alongside this there is an emerging interest
from the corporate sector in paying for the societal benefits of managing land more sustainably.
Place-based Payment for Ecosystem Service schemes have the potential to combine payments for a
number of the different benefits of changes in land management in the same location. However, a
major challenge is how to marry these complementary interests, given the practical, legal and
economic barriers that need to be overcome. The NERC internship scheme, managed by ESKTN,
provided the opportunity for the company to explore innovative approaches to extend the benefits
to landowners from their existing initiatives.
Summary
The internship funded by this project supported a team of experts1 to work with South West Water
(SWW) and local farmers to develop a scheme to enable local businesses to invest in the carbon,
water and biodiversity benefits of peatland restoration, alongside an existing scheme to achieve
water quality improvements (SWW's Upstream Thinking initiative).
As a result of the project, solutions have been proposed to a number of practical problems facing the
launch of such schemes. This has been done by compiling a prospectus for potential participants
(principally investors and land owners), which covers concerns raised by the many parties involved.
The project has also informed the development of a UK Peatland Code, also being funded by Defra,
to accredit projects and provide extra confidence to investors that claimed benefits will materialise.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>B507F721-2FA2-4A78-9182-DC2432AB0650</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5458f6922ba9a1.87503560</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Creative Economy,Environment,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Developing a place-based Payment for Ecosystem Service scheme
for South West peatlands. A NERC case study has been written for this project.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>A draft prospectus, intended for potential investors and land owners/managers, is one of the major
outputs from the project, providing advice to landowners, farmers, land managers and investors
about how a PES scheme could work, what factors need to be considered in deciding on site
suitability, and how land managers can decide if participation is right for them. The final
prospectus will offer guidance on how the financial impacts of a PES proposal can be evaluated.
Using the wealth of information in the prospectus a synopsis has been launched online to invite
feedback and comments on its overall structure which sets out details of how a scheme could be
implemented. Follow on work has been proposed to set out the 'offer' for PES on Exmoor to
investors. It is also now hoped to replicate this work on Dartmoor with further support from South
West Water Ltd.
SWW has identified the need to provide revenue return to the land owners it is working with to rewet
peatlands in the SW. This has become a priority issue for restoration work that depends upon
the participation of private moorland land-owners. The work of the NERC intern Charles Cowap
has led to a greater expectation from all stakeholders that there is now a real prospect of developing
a scheme in the near future. This aim is supported by SWW as the lead partner in the SW &amp;quot;Mireson-
the-Moors&amp;quot; Projects and the retention of the services of Charles Cowap has since worked with SWW to implement findings.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C122081C-07C2-4E2E-9D2A-FFD1B8C589CC</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56cc27f48ac7e7.11738897</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1A8A950F-CE3C-4F7C-9FDE-0B01BAA31A35</gtr:id><gtr:title>PROSPECTUS - PEATLAND RESTORATION AND INVESTMENT IN THE SOUTH WEST</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/fc323269f264317eb1dddf8a7fc65fe3"><gtr:id>fc323269f264317eb1dddf8a7fc65fe3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cowap C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>5458f89b93e817.30620741</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/K501384/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
