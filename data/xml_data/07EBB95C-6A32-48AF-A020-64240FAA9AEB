Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/K002686/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>The Imagine programme is a five-year project running from 2013 to 2017 which&amp;nbsp; brings together a range of different research projects working together across universities and their, mostly local, communities. Using the new knowledge gathered, researchers from universities and community groups will together imagine how communities might be different. They will experiment with different forms of community building that ignite imagination about the future and help to build resilience and a momentum for change&lt;br />&lt;br />However, Imagine will do more than just connect research on communities. At the heart of the programme is a vision to connect communities with research. Engagement with communities at all stages of the research places collaborative and participatory research methods in a central role to widen the ways community partners and universities can work together. The consortium is aiming for the ?democratisation of social research?. And with such a big team the members of the consortium are having to work out precisely what this might look like in practice. Just to add to the complexity, some projects will be contesting the very notion of community itself.&lt;br />Website: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imaginecommunity.org.uk/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>http://www.imaginecommunity.org.uk/&lt;/a>&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Many groups can be identified that will benefit from this research. Most direct beneficiaries are the organizations outside of academia who have already agreed to collaborate with the projects in the consortium, including 37 whose letters of support are included in this application. Others have agreed verbally. Collectively these partners represent a very wide range of organizations including museums and galleries, charities, and national organizations as well as local community-based organizations with established links to both community members and policy-makers. This range of organizations can only grow as the research proceeds. Several of the proposed projects involve re-visiting organizations involved in previous community-university partnerships (such as those in the SECC and Beacons programmes), and further broadening of the network of organizations benefitting from the research will occur through the programme of annual conferences and other dissemination events and through the use of the project website to reach out. In the commercial private sector, efforts will be made to engage with architects and builders involved in community-building and regeneration, through invitations to the conference at which Cheshire will provide an international perspective. Similar invitations will be targeted at public, voluntary and commercial sector organizations in relation to the conferences devoted to collaborative working, fostering historical imagination, democratic methods for researching communities, the sights and sounds of imagined community futures, and comparative perspectives on community dvelopment, all of which will be of interest to commercial organizations in the cultural sector. Finally, beneficiaries will include individuals who do not necessarily have formal links to organizations. The consortium will draw on the wealth of its members' experience of engaging the wider public through dissemination events and other activities.

These diverse groups will benefit in several ways. The most direct of these relate to the outcomes of the projects that involve planned interventions to explore the potential of communities of practice to foster resilience and momentum for change among members of disadvantaged communities. Alongside these projects are others which are also designed to promote active engagement in the process of thinking about different community futures and making them happen. Community relationships are at the heart of people's quality of life, and the promotion of active engagement in community processes has the potential to contribute to this, especially if these activities are inclusive and participatory. In working towards the achievement of this ideal, the consortium's approach emphasises the importance of learning from experience, both the knowledge of previous community development initiatives in the UK and lessons derived through engagement with international partners, who will each make extended visits to allow them to feed in across the consortium. The public policy dimensions of these issues include examination of how community initiatives avoid the well-known pitfalls of 'top-down' processes, while the fact that diverse communities in the UK will be involved will allow direct engagement with the localism agenda. The fact that the consortium's work involves a programme that unfolds over 5 years means that projects later on in the schedule will be able to build on the results of the earlier work, such as the engagement with the Participedia project on participatory politics. These results will be available at the end of year one, and community partners and advisory group members will advise on how best to feed them into the later projects. In this way, the development of skills in more democratic of research among academic researchers and community members will be promoted. Efforts will also be made to maximise the legacy of the consortium's work through creation of durable resources.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-05-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1821367</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This was a residency funded through the Imagine project.

The 'Resilience House' exhibition showcased the various RCUK resilience related projects with which the University of Brighton and boingboing have been involved. Within the 'Resilience House' there were various areas that corresponded to the 5 key areas of the resilience framework and within these we displayed videos, posters, resilience guides and other artistic outputs. Young people with complex needs and mental health difficulties co-curated the event and they explained the outputs to the visitors and were also involved in interactive aspects of the house such as making a 'Resilient tablecloth' and making a 'Resilience cake'.</gtr:description><gtr:id>C6624E1A-A2B2-4BAF-B0A2-2742C490EEDD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The festival ran for 2 days and on the second day, the 'Resilience House' was viewed by 135 people (accurate visitor statistics for day one are not available).

We have received requests to exhibit the 'Resilience House' at other conferences and events in the UK. The young people who co-curated and participated in the event have reported being more confident and they have experienced improvements in their mental health. Boingboing has appointed one of the young people as an artist in residence and they have a Visiting Fellowship at the University of Brighton.

Everyone involved shared and explored ideas. Displays of posters, banners, leaflets and booklets from the community organisations involved were viewed by everyone at the launch which helped disseminate information and people gained an understanding of each others work.
Presentations and discussion sessions encouraged discourse, feedback and the generation of new ideas and themes to explore further. Three workshops were carried out by organisations involved in the project that gave people a taster of the work they carry out and further information and resources.

The Community Radio Workshop - the aim to help Imagine residents and partners understand how they might be able to work with the two community radio stations broadcasting in Newcastle. The groups involved in the session saw that involving themselves as broadcasters would promote their project and provide the community radio station with content. Further development might involve joint funding bids on shared interests.
Still Listening Workshop - looked at oral history, really helpful for people researching/archiving local history and people that carry out oral history recording as part of the Imagine2 project. Information incl. good practice in interview techniques, recording equipment, editing software. 
Still Moving Workshop - West Newcastle Picture History Collection and St James Heritage and Environment group. The session provided a taster of their work: collecting and making available to the local community and wider public old photographs and film material relevant to the west end of Newcastle, and using photography and film to document and explore the history of the area. Useful for anyone involved in the Imagine2 project.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54639a6e2ca637.55372538</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Participants in your research and patient groups</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.dur.ac.uk/beacon/socialjustice/imagine/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Poster presentation: Building resilience through group visual arts activities (British Red Cross Resilience Conference 2013, London)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>690179DD-0413-452B-8BEB-13ED72754C16</gtr:id><gtr:impact>People who read the poster learnt how resilience could be built through visual arts activities.

Some of this work has been taken forward eg in a Case Study on Co-producing Ethics which has been produced for the ESRC website. Our work on co-production is being taking forward with our. jointly written book: 'Co-production: A Community Development Approach' to be published by Policy Press.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>59303D36-1A51-4B75-89A2-315160E10BC3</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546494a2dcfa55.68967431</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.imaginecommunity.org.uk</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Advisory Group Member for What Works Wellbieng Centre</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>037FC51A-CFBB-4CDB-95C8-A96C0DBFBDB8</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c31f2f5a5d69.13802683</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://whatworkswellbeing.org/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Expert advisors to: Developing Resilience in Practice: A Health Visiting Framework 2015</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D46B2CBC-989B-4483-BF06-44E00790DB24</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>564c9d7322fa46.20856017</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Membership of a guideline committee</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://ihv.org.uk/uploads/iHV_Practitioner%20Document_AW%20WEB%2030.04.15.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>this is an approach to conducting literature reviews based on the idea of consultation with practitioners and service users to generate the most appropriate review questions and analyse the results in the most helpful way</gtr:description><gtr:id>93179249-80CA-4E52-BEF9-3168DE0BBC86</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A colleague is carrying out her Phd using the approach.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545efb4667d638.91398884</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Systematic consultative review</gtr:title><gtr:type>Data analysis technique</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://journals.ub.uni-osnabrueck.de/index.php/jcyd/article/view/16</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>The Resilience Framework is based on Resilient Therapy (RT), the name we've given to the set of ideas and practices originally developed by Angie Hart and Derek Blincow, with help from Helen Thomas.

We took the resilience research evidence base and put it together with other sets of ideas gleaned from our practice with very disadvantaged children and families in an NHS Child and Adolescent Mental Health Clinic. Alongside this, Angie's adoptive parenting knowledge went into the mix and, we've collected experiences from those we are working with in our RT Communities of Practice.

We distilled all these different sets of ideas into a handy RT table that summarises our approach and acts as a reminder to people of what's included. Practitioners and parents use the table to plan strategic moves with children. We've also been developing a version of the table for use with adults, and this is where we've got to so far with that, which is still work in progress, the Resilience Framework for adults. All our tables and frameworks are available as pdfs in the Resources section on the boingboing website - it has also been translated into Greek, German, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish.</gtr:description><gtr:id>94F6FE4F-3185-4043-8110-8AD33C3EE648</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Numerous groups have adopted it and used it in various ways.
