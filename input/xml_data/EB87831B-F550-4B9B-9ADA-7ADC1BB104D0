1. To develop individual nerve cell models of Myoclonus Dystonia using skin cells (fibroblasts) from patients
2. Detailed study of the nerve cell models to determine what effect SGCE gene mutations have on the cells, in particular the neurotransmitter (chemical allowing communication between nerves) dopamine and its receptors.


Background to the research and its importance
Dystonia is one of the most common movement disorders, affecting 1 in 900 per population head. Well recognised forms include writer's cramp, although more severe forms are frequently observed. Dystonia is associated with significant lifetime disability, which has an impact on education and employment. There are currently no effective treatments for dystonia, necessitating an improved understanding of the underlying disease causing mechanisms in order to allow development of novel and potentially disease-modifying therapies to be developed.

This project is focused on Myoclonus Dystonia, an inherited, childhood-onset movement disorder with significant associated psychiatric symptoms. It is one of the most common forms of inherited dystonia and one of the few subtypes caused by mutations to a specific gene (SGCE). These characteristics make Myoclonus Dystonia an opportune disorder in which to study the underlying mechanisms of dystonia. The SGCE gene encodes the epsilon-sarcoglycan protein whose role in the brain, and how defects in its function give rise to dystonia, remain uncertain. Evidence from human brain imaging studies and animal models indicate that the communication (synapse) between dopaminergic neurons arising in the midbrain and medium spiny neurons in the striatum form a focal point of the neuronal disruption in dystonia.

My previous research work involved recruiting one of the largest worldwide cohorts of patients with Myoclonus Dystonia. All of these patients underwent detailed examination of their movement disorder and any psychiatric symptoms. I have selected fibroblast samples from two patients (with different gene mutations) in order to generate these nerve cell models.

Design and methods
The fibroblasts will be used to generate induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSc), cells that are capable of developing into all tissue types. Using a series of well-established techniques, these cells will be converted into nerve cells, more specifically dopaminergic nerve cells (from the midbrain) and medium spiny nerve cells (in the striatum), two nerve cell types thought to be important in dystonia. Both nerve cell types will be examined to determine the effect of SGCE mutations on the epsilon-sarcoglycan protein. Detailed study will also be carried out of the enzymes involved in producing dopamine, the proteins involved in the transporting it across the cell membrane, and the receptors that signal its effect between the two cell types. The second stage of experiments will involve culturing both cell types together, examining their electrical communication and the structure of the neuronal processes. 

Results will be compared to nerve models produced from tissue donated by healthy, unrelated individuals. We also plan to use a new genetic technique (Clustered Regularly Interspersed Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)) to 'edit' the cells from the patients with Myoclonus Dystonia, returning the SGCE gene sequence to normal, in order to demonstrate that the changes seen in the original nerve cell model are due to the SGCE mutations.

Detailing these processes will improve our understanding of why dystonia, and potentially some psychiatric symptoms arise, as well as providing a platform for the development of new drugs and therapeutic options.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Aims
Generate a neuronal cell model for SGCE mutation-positive Myoclonus Dystonia (MD) using patient derived fibroblasts 
Characterise this model to determine changes to monoaminergic neurotransmission at the nigro-striatal junction

Background
Dystonia is a common and disabling movement disorder. Poor understanding of its pathophysiology has led to few effective treatment options. MD is one of few genetically determined dystonias caused by fully penetrant, autosomal dominant mutations (epsilon-sarcoglycan gene, SGCE), providing a unique opportunity for investigation. Previous studies suggest that disruption of the nigro-striatal junction, specifically dopamine-2-receptor (D2R) function, is central to pathogenesis. My previous work involved detailed phenotyping of a large MD cohort (n=30). Two mutation types will be used to develop induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines: nonsense (c.289C&amp;gt;T,p.Arg97X) and missense (c.622G&amp;gt;A,p.Gly441Asp) mutations. 

Methodology
IPSC lines will be generated using Sendai virus vector techniques and differentiated using dual SMAD inhibition and Activin A into midbrain dopaminergic and striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) respectively. Characterisation of the neuronal models will include measurement of dopamine synthetic enzymes, transport proteins and the density and distribution of dopamine receptors. A co-culture platform of the two neuronal cell types will undergo phenotyping using electrophysiological techniques, calcium imaging and detailing of dendritic spine morphology. Control neuronal models will include those from healthy, unrelated individuals and isogenic 'rescue' cell lines of the MD patient samples by use of CRISPR technology. 

Scientific and Medical opportunities
This project provides an excellent model system with which to investigate the cellular mechanisms that underlie dystonia pathogenesis. Findings from this work will inform future studies, particularly the identification of novel therapeutic targets.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Onset of primary dystonias is typically in the first two decades of life, at a time of great developmental and educational importance. A lack of understanding of the pathophysiology and poor recognition of these disorders in society often leads to late presentation to health services, under recognition and frequent misdiagnosis. The increasing evidence for psychiatric symptoms as a primary component of the disorder phenotype adds to the need for accurate diagnosis and effective management.

This project will have an impact on several significant groups. These benefits will be seen in the short-, medium- and long-term.

1. Individuals and families affected by Myoclonus Dystonia
This project aims to develop a neuronal model for Myoclonus Dystonia that will aid in understanding the cellular mechanisms that underpin the disorder. This will allow patients to have a greater understanding of the cause of their disorder, and why those with one mutation type may differ from another. Ultimately the aim of this work is to develop novel therapeutic strategies that will benefit patient care and potentially lead to the beginnings of personalized medicine.

2. Individuals affected by dystonia
The findings and understanding from this project will have implications for the wider spectrum of dystonic disorders. Points of commonality of pathways and mechanisms may provide areas to target in drug development. Results from this work are also likely to facilitate greater understanding from systems based approaches, such as animal models and human imaging studies.

3. Healthcare Professionals
An improved understanding of cellular mechanisms and underlying pathophysiology will allow clinicians (and other healthcare professionals) to better explain the disorder to their patients. It may also provide some explanation as to why some currently used therapies are more effective in some patients than others, and allow more targeted guiding of treatment.

4. Researchers
Successful development of this neuronal model would be a significant contribution to this field of research. It would provide valuable insights and help guide the work of the International Myoclonus Dystonia Study Group (of which I am a member), facilitate greater understanding of the findings from more systems based approaches, as well as impact the research into other neurodevelopmental disorders. 

5. Development of therapeutics
Although beyond the scope of this study, the long-term aim of this project is the identification of novel therapeutic targets and development of large scale clinical trials. This would represent a significant outcome for a group of disorders whose current treatments are extremely limited. 

6. Professionals involved with the project
This project will form a platform for the development of an exciting and cutting edge research group at Cardiff University, focused on the development of translational models and effective therapeutics for patients with dystonia. We would form one of very few groups internationally with this as their primary focus, and contribute significantly to the many ongoing collaborative initiatives. 

7. Wider society
Dystonia is the third most common form of movement disorder with an estimated prevalence of 1/900 (dystonia.org.uk) and significant social, educational and health economic implications. Improved therapeutic strategies could have a widespread impact on these and workforce employment. Positive results in this project would also raise the public profile of Dystonia and potentially lead to further fundraising and charity-led funding of research. Policy makers have recognized the importance of this with the establishment of the European COST Dystonia initiative (BMBS COST Action BM1101) and the NIH funded Dystonia Coalition in North America (rarediseasesnetwork.org).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder
