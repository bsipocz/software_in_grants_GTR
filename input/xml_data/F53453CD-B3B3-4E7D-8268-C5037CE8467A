&lt;p>The principal aim of this project is to examine the extent to which tenure changes and residential mobility are triggered by fertility outcomes such as the birth of a(nother) child or a child reaching primary or secondary school age, allowing for the effects of other social processes such as union formation and dissolution and employment changes. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project will also consider spatial variation in the relationship between housing transitions and fertility, both within Britain and between Britain and Australia. The primary data sources for the project are the British Household Panel Study (BHPS) and the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project will also investigate a number of important methodological issues in the analysis of panel data, including the nested structure of housing histories (repeated episodes of living in the same tenure or house within individuals), and adjustment for unmeasured individual characteristics that affect both changes in housing and changes in fertility. &lt;br />&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>418738</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Neighbourhood choice of young families in England (RSS symposium, Speaker: E.

Although motivated by questions concerning the relationship between housing transitions and fertility, the research had a methodological focus. Our strategy was therefore to publish methodological research in leading applied statistics and social science methods journals, followed by more substantively-oriented research which makes use of the new methods. An example of this strategy is our research on push and pull effects in neighbourhood choice which involved developing a longitudinal discrete-choice model to estimate the effects of area characteristics on the decision to move from the current area and on the choice of destination among movers, allowing for the importance of area factors to depend on changes in household circumstances and unmeasured household characteristics. This work is currently under revision for the Journal of the American Statistical Association, and further research is in progress to apply the same methods in a study of neighbourhood choice of young families. 

To date we have 3 working papers which apply methodological research conducted under the project to studies of the effects of the presence and age of children on residential mobility and location choice. This work has been disseminated through conferences and seminars and, once it has been through the peer review process, briefing notes will be prepared to publicise the findings to a general audience. This phase of the project has taken longer than anticipated because of a reduction in the time the project researcher was able to commit in the final year of the project following her appointment to a lectureship and subsequent award of a research fellowship.

For the above reasons, the impact of the research has been largely scientific. In the longer-term, research conducted under the project has the potential to achieve societal and economic impact in two ways: (i) indirect impact through application of methods developed under the project by academics engaged in policy research and in research commissioned by government and third sector organisations, and (ii) a direct impact of findings from our substantive research on housing and fertility.

Project research has been disseminated in the following ways: articles in journals across a range of disciplines (demography, economics, sociology and statistics), seminars, conference presentations in the UK and overseas, a one-day symposium funded by the project, and two 2-day short courses on multilevel event history analysis. To date, the research has resulted in 6 journal articles, 2 revise and resubmits and a further 3 working papers. There have been 34 seminars and conference presentations, 14 of which have been outside the UK. A one-day symposium on &amp;quot;Recent advances in research on housing transitions and the life course&amp;quot; was held in December 2013 at the Royal Statistical Society in London. As well as presentations on research from the project, there were 5 invited speakers including leading figures in housing research such as Prof William Clark (UCLA) and Prof Clara Mulder (University of Groningen). The event attracted a total of around 60 participants, including non-academics (e.g. from Office for National Statistics, Department for Work and Pensions, National Housing Federation, Housing Futures Ltd and London Borough of Tower Hamlets). 

To build capacity in longitudinal data analysis we held two short courses on multilevel event history analysis. These provided training for 45 participants, and many more have been able to access our extensive materials from the project website. The materials include slides and computer practicals in Stata and MLwiN, which show in detail how to prepare and analyse data in statistical software. We have also written online appendices to methodological journal articles which include annotated syntax for Stata, aML, MLwiN and SAS. Future capacity building plans include a session on analysing longitudinal households at Understanding Society's Scientific Conference in July 2015. The conference provides a forum for discussing good practice in the analysis of household panel data, and our session will draw on project research on methods for the study of household effects when household composition changes over time.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>4DE0CE77-4A09-4859-A9C5-F8558E3F4510</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>544e82256d50b2.21938383</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Several strands investigated the effect of the presence and age of children on migration and residential mobility, with a focus on the methodological challenges in such analyses. One paper compared different approaches to the analysis of household-level decisions using longitudinal individual-level data when household composition changes over time, and introduced new random effects models (Steele, Clarke and Washbrook, Sociological Methodology). These models have also been employed in analysis of residential mobility in Australia (Haynes and Martinez, submitted). In Britain the results show an increased chance of a move during pregnancy and shortly after a birth, but lower mobility among larger families and a decline in mobility with the age of the youngest child. Other methodological research considered the impact of non-ignorable attrition when drop-out is directly influenced by moving home (Washbrook, Clarke and Steele, J. Roy. Stat. Soc. C). Ermisch and Washbrook (Scottish Journal of Political Economy) focused on the effect of housing equity on residential mobility of home-owners under age 45. Moves among this group are likely to be motivated by the desire to 'upgrade' housing in terms of space for additional children or neighbourhood quality. The results suggest that the ability of households to realise their moving desires is inhibited by low equity in their current homes.

Another strand of research investigated spatial variation in fertility and the effect of local house prices. Kulu and Washbrook (Advances in Life Course Research) examined fertility variation between central London, London suburbs, other towns and cities, and small towns and rural areas. The analysis shows that fertility rates increase as settlement size decreases, a pattern that is not explained by migration of couples to smaller settlements in anticipation of childbearing. Washbrook (submitted) used monthly area-level house price data linked to individual-level data to explore the precise timing of the relationship between housing market conditions and fertility responses. The results reveal positive but temporary effects on the fertility of home-owners, in contrast to negative and longer-lasting effects on the fertility of renters. 

The above research focused on either the effects of family changes on housing transitions or the effects of residential context and other housing-related factors on childbearing. Joint analysis of the two processes enhances our understanding of their interrelationship. Multichannel sequence analysis was used to study holistic housing pathways for Australian families (Spalek, Haynes and Jones, J. Longitudinal and Lifecourse Studies). Comparative research of housing pathways in Australia and Britain is underway. Kulu and Steele (Demography) used multilevel simultaneous equations modelling, applied to rich Finnish register data, to analyse the relative timing of childbearing and housing changes. 

Another strand of research considered the process by which individuals sort into different types of neighbourhood. A longitudinal mixed logit model was developed to estimate the effects of area characteristics on the decision to move from the current area ('push' effects) and on the choice of destination among movers ('pull' effects), allowing the importance of area factors to depend on measured and unmeasured household characteristics (Steele, Washbrook et al, submitted). Further research is in progress to apply this methodology in a study of neighbourhood choices of young families.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The principal aim of the project was to develop appropriate methodology for examining the relationship between housing transitions and fertility and, more broadly, the analysis of longitudinal data on individuals and households. We therefore expect that the research will have most impact on the ways in which quantitative social scientists analyse longitudinal data. In the short term we anticipate that the methods developed under the project will be used primarily by academic researchers, with impact on the non-academic users arising indirectly through substantive research conducted by academic social scientists. Adoption by non-academics is a longer-term goal, which we believe is achievable given increasing recognition of methodological issues such as attrition, clustering and selection biases and implementation of methods developed under the project in statistical software.

In terms of the substantive findings of the research, the results of our analyses add to the evidence base on the constraints that many households face in decisions about whether to move house, and the timing and destination of a move. For example, our research on the effects of housing equity on homeowners' residential mobility and the differential effects of house prices on fertility for owners and renters provides important information on the consequences of rising house prices for families. Our research on fertility variation by residential context further supports the importance of housing availability and costs on couples' decision to have a child. 

Our ongoing research on how push and pull effects in neighbourhood choice depend on household characteristics contributes to understanding of the evolution of socio-spatial segregation. Such information can inform policies aimed at assisting disadvantaged groups such as low-income households, single parents and social housing tenants.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>05DB8743-2BE5-45F3-8A02-F922FEF2BDAA</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544e83079b0866.59980067</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social
