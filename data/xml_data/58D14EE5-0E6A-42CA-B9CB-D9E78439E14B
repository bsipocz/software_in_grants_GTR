Water plays a significant role in the degradation of railway infrastructure and can cause poor track geometry and accelerated deterioration of ballast, with high associated maintenance and repair costs which inevitably get passed on to the end-user. Excessive amounts of water may also cause catastrophic failure of railway infrastructure systems, which represent a real threat to public safety. 

Climate change is predicted to result in more extreme weather and flash flood events. The railway drainage systems will therefore be put under severe strain with increased likelihood of disruption to rail services. Much of the UK railway drainage infrastructure is old and in need of repair or replacement. However, the UK railway industry is experiencing significant growth in the number of passengers and the amount of freight carried, which reduces the opportunities available to carry out maintenance. 

In light of these issues, railway drainage system modernisation is considered to be a key factor for improving railway network safety and capacity, and ensuring the infrastructure's resilience to changing weather and climate events. 

This project focuses on providing novel and easily installed railway drainage solutions which make use of lightweight and cost-effective 'new materials'. 'New materials' includes those recently developed as well as materials that can be newly applied within drainage systems. The project will consider a range of materials for use in this application, such as Expanded Polystyrene (EPS) which is a lightweight and strong material with good chemical resistance. The project includes a range of experimental testing, including trials of a new material drainage system within a full-scale railway track model, as well as advanced small-scale physical modelling using the University of Nottingham geotechnical centrifuge. Numerical models will also be developed to gain a better understanding of the effects of key parameters within the drainage system. 

An important component of the project is the development of tools which will allow for the assessment of the full lifecycle costs of the developed new material drainage solutions. These tools have the potential to help railway operators make informed decisions relating to the selection of track and drainage system maintenance and repair solutions. Advanced tools will also be developed which will provide a better understanding of the inter-relationships between railway drainage performance and other railway systems, including other infrastructure assets and operation services. 

The project benefits from the involvement of experts from railway industry, including URS, a leading provider of engineering, construction and technical services within the railway sector, and ASPIN, who provide a range of consultancy services to the railway industry. The project will also benefit from access to information from Network Rail, the owner of the UK railway infrastructure, through proven links between the research team and representatives from Network Rail. The project fosters a multi-disciplinary approach to developing engineering solutions, with expertise from several technical areas, including geotechnics, transportation infrastructure design and performance as well as asset management.

The successful completion of the project will allow the development of modern railway drainage solutions which incorporate new lightweight, easy to install, and cost-effective materials. The lifecycle cost assessment tools developed as part of this project will enable railway operators to make informed decisions about railway maintenance and repair, and ensure that end-uses of the railway get the best service possible.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The work carried out in the project will be of significant benefit to wider society, policy makers and industry. The impact of the research project encompasses a wide range of economical, societal, and developmental benefits. 

The societal and economic impacts of the project are long-term, and have potential influence at both national and international levels. Effective drainage systems within railway infrastructure are essential for ensuring public safety and the reliability of the railway network, particularly when faced with future challenges from climate change and population growth. Poor drainage leads to increased rates of trackbed degradation with associated maintenance costs, and can also result in catastrophic failure of railway infrastructure which poses a serious risk to public health. A safe and resilient railway is therefore of prime importance for the economy as well as safety and quality of life in the UK. The outcomes of this project will ensure that resilient railway drainage systems can be developed using the most cost-effective options available. High-performing infrastructure is also an essential component of the UK's competitiveness in the international economic market. Solutions developed as part of this project could be marketed globally, with a clear advantage available to UK enterprise.

It is envisaged that findings, methods, and techniques developed during the project will also assist both policy makers (e.g. Department of Transport and RSSB) and practitioners in the railway industry. Project outcomes will provide guidance on the utilisation of new materials and the design and long term management of railway drainage systems. Tools developed within the project will provide new ways of assessing drainage systems in terms of interactions with other parts of infrastructure. Use of these tools will provide policy makers and practitioners with quantitative methods of evaluating whole-life costs of railway drainage assets as well as how their performance impacts the wider railway system. This will ensure that informed decisions form future policy, standards and regulations that affect railway assets.

The tools provided by the research project for the design and management of new drainage systems will offer solutions for the potential reduction of whole life costs. For example, Network Rail, the owner of the UK railway infrastructure, using the solutions offered by this project, may be able to make cost savings resulting in direct economic benefits. Furthermore, resulting improvement in the reliability of the railway infrastructure will also improve customer satisfaction, which has long-reaching societal and economic benefits since potential businesses will be able to rely on an efficient transport system. 

Outcomes of the research will impact on other sectors of transportation engineering. Companies specialising in drainage solutions applicable to other infrastructure (e.g. roads) may benefit by adopting the proposed solutions. 

The project also represents an opportunity to develop expertise of young professionals within a significant sector of transportation engineering and to expose them to the importance of a multi-disciplinary approach to developing advanced engineering solutions. The new skills and knowledge acquired by the early career researchers involved in this project will have significant benefit for their career development and employability.

In the long-term, the expertise gained by the project team can be successfully exploited for further developments in a range of civil engineering and operational research disciplines.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-03-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-09-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>591596</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Article in Rail Technology Magazine</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FB05ACFE-D30A-466C-AB18-B894391B39A7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Article published in magazine which gives an overview of the research project.

Potential of prognostics in positively contributing to safety and improving life-cycle costs of the railways is equally relevant to existing legacy systems and new system designs. Legacy systems adopt additional sensing and processing with a potentially high price of retrofitting and additional validation and/or certification costs to gain extended system life and safety factor. New system designs like the one proposed in this research for railway drainage can significantly reduce these costs if physics-based prognostics and condition monitoring are adopted early in the design to facilitate a more optimal asset management. This, however, it requires integration of condition monitoring and the modelling of the system behaviour into the asset management process. The prognostics-based asset management methodology developed allows for such integration in a soundly and rigorous way.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c151fd4fd1c9.78281915</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Prognostics-based drainage asset management model</gtr:title><gtr:type>Computer model/algorithm</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>A full Bayesian inverse problem framework has been developed to formally assess the suitability of the proposed analytical model for water flow for the many possible values of model parameters.

also provides a rigorous framework to account for the various types of modeling uncertainties (discretization

This generalization for more than 2 layers including non-parallel layers is crucial when considering the railway internal drainage under real service conditions, since maintenance activities like ballast tamping or degradations processes like the ballast fouling actually lead to additional non-parallel layers that greatly modify the hydraulic behavioir of the system. In addition, the adoption of an analytical model instead of numerical models like Finite-Differences is key for life-cycle assessment, where thousands of models evaluations are required.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bd3f8a8f8342.83792541</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Analytical model for steady state water flow in sloping layered porous media</gtr:title><gtr:type>Computer model/algorithm</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C276817C-59A7-44F8-9B8C-46F5C3BDB4FC</gtr:id><gtr:title>An information theoretic approach for knowledge representation using Petri nets</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e2b3ef27a271fdcc9c68f2b3e4a0e769"><gtr:id>e2b3ef27a271fdcc9c68f2b3e4a0e769</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Chiachio M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58dcec34b364a2.36624347</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/M023028/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
