The first two groups have received major recent scholarly attention, but the twelve texts in the last group have been comparatively neglected, though a series of editions of the Middle English (ME) texts for the Early English Text Society in the late 19th century gave them a prominent identity as 'The English Charlemagne Romances'. \n\nFrom the 14th to the 16th century, verse romances of Charlemagne were composed and copied, and Caxton printed a prose life of Charles the Great as well as the Morte Darthur, but while Arthurian themes persisted in English literature and culture, those of Charlemagne did not. This might seem explicable if he is viewed as the national hero of the French. Yet, to the puzzlement of critics, the production of most English Charlemagne texts coincided with the Hundred Years' War. Is it significant, therefore, that the original French texts already existed in Anglo-Norman (AN) form? In what sense might Charlemagne have had an established insular identity? \n\nThe aim of the Charlemagne in England project is to explore this insular literary tradition with equal focus on the AN and the ME texts, examining the textual relations between them and the correspondences in narrative form and generic expectations. It assesses the evidence for their audiences and reception in a multilingual society, and for their contemporary cultural and political significance. The central conflict represented, between Christians and Saracens, offers parallels to international crusading interests in the earlier AN period, and in the 14th and 15th centuries mirrors the perceived threat to western security from the Ottoman Turks. The prominence in so many of the texts of the motif of the chivalrous Saracen indicates, through the fantasy of conversion, a desire for engagement with the eastern Other. This complex reflection of cultural and political concerns in medieval England has some resonances for contemporary Britain.\n\nFurther investigation is needed of the religious element in the insular Charlemagne tradition. The emphasis in early French works on recaptured Passion relics, specifically related to pilgrimage sites, is modified in AN and ME texts for different purposes. The strong catechetical feature in many of the texts may relate to the concerns of the Fourth Lateran Council (1215), which combined a programme of pastoral reform and education with the promotion of crusade to retake Jerusalem, both reflected in Charlemagne texts. Aspects of piety in the ME texts have been attributed to 'clerical authorship', and this too needs investigation in relation to lay piety.\n\nThis is a timely project - it benefits from the work of the French of Medieval England programme (York) and the Multilingualism project (Bristol). It will stimulate fuller critical attention to the AN texts. Dr Ailes is completing an edition of the Egerton MS La Destruction de Rome and Fierenbras, and proposes that a PhD student edit the independent Hanover MS text. Equally, the project will encourage overdue new editions of the ME works, for while The Siege of Melayne and Rauf Coil3ear - both unique texts with no known source - have been edited more than once, the eight separate verse texts based on Fierabras, Otinel, and the Chanson de Roland await thorough scholarly attention. An indication of what can be done is provided by Mrs Hardman's study of the ME Roland fragment, informed by Duggan's recent critical edition of the French Roland corpus, and a PhD student will build on this work, investigating the tradition of Roncevaux in medieval Britain. \n\nThis is a considerable, coherent project in itself and also the exemplar for a larger collaborative project on an international scale to explore the tradition anew in other languages and cultures: 'Chalemagne in Europe'.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>245141</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>'Politics and Propaganda: Two medieval Literary manuscripts', Heraldry Society (London)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>00423122-A588-401A-91E6-4C517FA05A83</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This lecture for the Heraldry Society addressed the national membership association (members of the public).

The paper examined three examples of the kinds of innovation shown in the English 'translations', which can range from minor but significant alterations, to major projects of reimagining.

It explores concurrent themes in his representation, both in the texts themselves and the miniatures which accompany them, and argues for a reading of the emperor's presence in the manuscript as an exemplar of kingly behaviour and, as king and emperor, a template for the Lancastrian dual monarchy promoted by the book's commissioner, Sir John Talbot, earl of Shrewsbury.

The first three plays, with local participants involved at every level of the production, were performed in outdoor settings in Walsall town centre in August and November 2012 and February 2013, and the November and February performances were repeated in indoor settings. The November indoor performance was a gala event at which the Lord Mayor was present, and video interviews were played to provide context for the performance of the play.

We discovered evidence for a more widespread dissemination of the French epic tradition in England than had hitherto been suspected. We found a persistent history of cultural re-appropriation of the tradition and adaptation of the stories to new circumstances. Particularly striking was the discovery that these insular texts were put to specifically political and religious use in their new contexts. This is equally true of the French-language (Anglo-Norman) and Middle English texts. Whereas earlier scholarship had tended to dismiss the later texts (in particular the Middle English ones) as inferior derivatives of poorly assimilated originals, we showed that the many variations are evidence of a vigorous and continuing creative engagement with the texts, with later writers re-interpreting them to reflect different issues and concerns from those that prevailed at the time of the early epic productions. In addition, one of the two PhD students attached to the AHRC project addressed the question of post-medieval Charlemagne texts and found evidence that the history of cultural re-appropriation continues into the modern period, with recent adaptations of the legends reflecting 21st-century concerns such as issues of gender and ecology.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The potential for non-academic use of our research findings can be exemplified by the following achieved instance.
