Building collaborations between academics (London South Bank University/University of Kent) and the third sector (Mix-d), the project raises general questions about the visibility and accessibility of minority ethnic history in Britain and asks how knowledge in this field can be better viewed and shared. These questions will be addressed specifically and explored practically and creatively through a small research project: 'Creating the 'Mix-d Museum'. This will involve the development of an interactive online archive for young people and schools based on research findings from a British Academy funded project on racial mixing and mixedness in 20th century Britain.

The proposed research collaboration and the activities emerging from it examines communication of academic knowledge in a digital age, the sharing and ownership of cultural memory and identity and the development of new ways of working to enhance access and creativity.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In addition to academic beneficiaries (see Academic Beneficiaries section), this exploratory research will address the needs of non-academic users for greater substantive knowledge about the history of racial mixing and mixedness in twentieth century Britain. In the immediate term, the research network and project emerging from it will directly benefit the organisation Mix-d, who will use the findings to enhance their own knowledge and practices in working with pupils from mixed racial backgrounds, their families and educators

In light of the lack of substantive knowledge about the history of mixed race people, couples and families in twentieth century Britain, it is expected that the findings will also be of interest to a number of other organisations, services and individuals working in the specific area of support for mixed racial people and families generally (e.g. People in Harmony, Intermix, Mosaic, Starlight). Similarly, the project is likely to be of interest to those working in the general area of minority ethnic history, particularly organisations with an online presence (e.g. Black Atlantic Resource, Equiano Centre, Moving Stories). In both cases, it is foreseeable that the findings can feed into existing resources (e.g. databases of archival material, newsletters, online articles, etc.) to supplement the particular work and focus of the organisations involved. The project may also be of interest to a number of museums (e.g. Imperial War Museum North, M-Shed) who frequently focus on minority ethnic history in their own exhibitions and collections. For example, Mix-d are currently in discussion with Imperial War Museum North about collaborating on an exhibition highlighting the history of racial mixing in Britain.

It is likely that there will be other potential beneficiaries of the research and we will draw on our extensive networks to disseminate our findings more generally as well as identify areas for future collaboration and research. People and families from mixed racial and ethnic backgrounds are of enduring interest to a range of general and specialist national and local broadcast and print media and we are frequently approached by journalists for information in this area. As such, we can also draw on our own established contacts (e.g. The BBC, The Guardian, The Observer, The Sunday Times) as a potential means of disseminating the research network and project more widely. 

It is imagined that the findings from the exploratory research will also have long term impacts, through informing further research in this area with other partners with subsequent wider-ranging impacts, including overseas (e.g. by focusing on particular communities, geographies/countries or aspects of racial mixing and mixedness). The research team has a good track record of engagement with voluntary, statutory and government organisations in the UK as regards feeding previous research findings and work on mixed race issues into wider discussions on race and equality (e.g. to ONS, the Commission for Racial Equality, Department for Communities and Local Government, The Runnymede Trust) and would look to engage these contacts further in the development of more extensive work emerging from the initial research network and project. Mix-d also has a developing network of contacts in the USA and Europe and is currently investigating plans to host an international 'e-conference' on experiences of racial mixing and mixedness which the research network and project would most certainly be able to contribute to.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>23941</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Online Case Study: NCPPE</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>47E95E82-A15A-42E0-8C37-F6558A9824A4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Mix-d Museum project was longlisted in the National Co-Ordinating Centre for Public Engagment's competition as a entrant for the Engaging with Young People Award.

Educators and students have made extensive use of the Museum. For example, one school in Manchester has incorporated the resource into their curriculum, while students at another Manchester school have produced a highly visible wall mural based on the Mix-d Museum model to communicate their own understandings of mixedness and family heritages to other students, teachers, parents and visitors.In 2013, Mix-d also drew on the project in their engagement with 250 foster carers to help them raise awareness of history and the potential issues facing mixed race families and equip them with appropriate understanding and resources. A number of bloggers have also written about how the Museum has helped shape and change understandings of the history of racial and ethnic mixing in Britain.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>A9E07E59-5635-4F10-8887-D4AEB65B348E</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5464a23c4eadd8.52352420</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Collaboration between academics (Dr Chamion Caballero, London South Bank University and Dr Peter Aspinall, University of Kent), the third sector (Mix-d), and the private sector (Ivy Park Media) has resulted in the development of the Mix-d Museum, an interactive online archive based on research findings from a British Academy funded project on racial mixing and mixedness in 20th century Britain. 
In its exploration of the sharing of knowledge on minority ethnic history in Britain, the project established a new and exciting collaborative partnership between the different sectors, as well as opening up the research to a whole new audience of young people and schools. The collaboration has not only allowed the academic partners to reach a wider audience for their findings, but it has also encouraged them to think more innovatively and creatively about their dissemination processes generally. Under and through the guidance and contacts of Mix-d, the academic partners have been able to access established pathways to young people and schools and receive insightful feedback on their subject knowledge and interests, thus helping shape the content and direction of future research. Secondly, the collaboration has allowed Mix-d - who host the archive - access to rigorous and substantive academic knowledge that has informed the organisation's working and dissemination practices as well as providing access to a new audience of academics and practitioners. Thirdly, much of the ease of use and impact generated by the digital content is a result of the excellent web design which was outsourced to Ivy Park Media. The private sector partner has benefited from becoming a key member of a partnership at the forefront of using digital technologies to disseminate research to wider audiences. Overall, this partnership has resulted in a new and creative resource that will act as a model to others seeking to share 'hidden histories' with a wider audience, as well as a working relationship that continues to seek funding to develop knowledge transfer activities.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In addition to enhancing awareness about the history of racial mixing and mixedness in Britain, the proposed activities also create an innovate model illustrating the 'potential of digitisation' for the process of 'opening up' of archives. We therefore expect that the project will have some impact on current dialogue and understandings of best practice in terms of sharing information on minority ethnic histories and engaging audiences who may not typically visit archives or museums, whether online or offline. As such, we expect our findings to continue to appeal to a range of audiences who also work to record and share information on minority ethnic history in Britain, not only the academic sector but also those within education and archive and museum development, as well as those with a specialist interest in minority ethnic and the experiences of mixed race people, couples and families in particular, including agencies working in the field of mixed race families and social care/support.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E0E09FB4-3543-4BC5-BF1C-765DDF627B43</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5464a0c69ddd94.39174779</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.mix-d.org/museum/timeline</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The Mix-d Museum is an interactive online archive which allows users to scroll through a selection of the material gathered during a project on the history of racial and ethnic mixing in twentieth century Britain (funded by the British Academy).</gtr:description><gtr:id>52B9C3D8-8C74-44AE-9DA0-ACC83107E9B4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The website has had over 40,000 page views from visitors from 152 different countries and has been drawn on by secondary school educators as part of both school curriculum and extra-curricular activities.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5464b16d92aaf4.68353072</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Mix-d Museum archive</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.mix-d.org/museum/timeline</gtr:url></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2547C9ED-E3EC-40C8-87E3-9A0D36982A6C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Afro Solo UK: 39 Life Stories of African Life in Greater Manchester 1920-1960</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/cf4b8268c0d063d846de3292a63fe331"><gtr:id>cf4b8268c0d063d846de3292a63fe331</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Caballero, C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-0-9542766-1-4</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>5464a6a191c4c9.10908398</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BEBDF896-4043-4511-B583-972AB732DB39</gtr:id><gtr:title>'Broken Blossoms', 'Undesirable Elements'or 'Ordinary Families'?: Social Attitudes towards and Lived Experiences of Anglo-Chinese Mixing in Britain, 1900-1950</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Asian American Literary Review</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/263334211fc0bf9c5c775143c8f8148d"><gtr:id>263334211fc0bf9c5c775143c8f8148d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Aspinall, P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5464a44bafca08.69018403</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/J012718/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DCE73056-5E3D-4976-B573-234E5FF4D633</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic &amp; Social History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
