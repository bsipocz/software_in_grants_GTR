Does candidate religion influence vote choice? And if so, under what conditions does religion matter? Previous research has found that minority candidates can receive either an electoral advantage from members of their in-group and/or an electoral penalty from members of their out-group. However, the social mechanisms that underpin these candidate effects are not well understood. Some variant of social identity theory or empowerment theory is usually proffered to explain the ethnic advantage; whereas some variant of racial/religious discrimination is usually employed to explain the ethnic penalty. Both mechanisms imply an expressive calculus (identity / prejudice) and more instrumental mechanisms are rarely explored. Moreover, this research has been largely limited to studies of minorities in the advanced industrial democracies of Western Europe and North America. In this contribution we provide the first systematic analysis of the impact of candidate religion on voting behavior in an ethnically divided democracy: Uttar Pradesh, North India. The results from a series of conditional logit models shows that Muslims are indeed more likely to vote for Muslim candidates, but only when those candidates have a realistic chance of winning - there is thus a strong strategic element to their vote calculus. Moreover, we show that Hindus do not discriminate against Muslim candidates, and that parties do not face an electoral penalty for fielding a Muslim candidate.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Jawaharlal Nehru University, India</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>India, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Balu Sunilraj and Oliver Heath</gtr:description><gtr:id>A3C5AF5C-F815-44A8-8C96-B7B3A8133F45</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Sunilraj, B, and Heath, O.

Tillin, Targeted social transfers, political clientelism and modes of electoral accountability in central India', International Development Institute, King's College London, May 2014</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>b9d99496b9d994aa-2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Heath and Tillin designed and conducted a survey in 40 villages on both sides of the state border between the two central Indian states of Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh. The survey contained questions designed to assess how far differences in public service delivery in the two states influenced voting behaviour. The survey was conducted on the ground by colleagues at Guru Ghasidas University in Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh. Oliver Heath conducted follow-up fieldwork in January 2014 after the survey had been completed to gather more qualitative information to inform data analysis. Tillin and Heath have subsequently worked together to write an article, with further publications planned on other elements of data analysis.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Oliver Heath and Louise Tillin commenced a new research collaboration designed to examine linkages between government performance/service delivery across Indian states and voting behavior. The study seeks to exploit a 'quasi-natural' experiment by surveying villages along the border of two states which have adopted different models of reform to the delivery of public services - one state which has limited the role for political discretion in determining access/quality of service delivery; another in which we expect political patronage to continue to play a strong role. We will investigate whether different modes of voter behaviour/electoral accountability are discernible in the two states.

This collaboration has helped leverage the immense field knowledge available amongst journalists. Two special trainings were imparted to acquaint them with the details and nuances of the ethnographic method.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The field work and research done for this project has led to considerable advancement of thinking on the issues that voters consider significant while making their electoral choices. The ethnographies unravel the embedded contexts within which voter deliberations are done, as also the meanings they attach to this activity. Both the context and the meaning are missed out in large-scale surveys of voter-opinions and political trends. Besides, new efforts have been made to fine-tune the research methods to cover urban areas, which involve a significant difference of context, and are under-researched as yet. 

The field sites have been carefully selected to highlight the conditions of marginal and disadvantaged social groups in rural and urban areas-this includes a special focus on social caste group of the scheduled castes, and the scheduled tribes, field sites where displacement has been caused due to development projects, and spatial locations of urban slums and unauthorized settlements. This variety helps bring a sharp focus on the question of why amidst (and notwithstanding) severe disadvantage and deprivation, voters turn out in large numbers in Indian elections-the original theme of investigation for the project.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>King's College London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Targeted Social Transfers, Political Clientelism and Modes of Accountability in North India</gtr:description><gtr:id>0ED61F24-BB79-48E9-A25A-0BFBE76E3613</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Heath, O., and Tillin, L.

Abstract: Does the nature of political competition influence voter turnout? Whereas prior research exploring this link focuses on the number of parties and the competitiveness of races, we hypothesize that the entry and exit of parties should also affect turnout. Building on research on the costs of voting and voting as a habit, we identify and test three hypotheses linking party system change to turnout. First, we expect that turnout should decrease when major parties exit the party system, as some set of voters can no longer vote for their preferred party and must engage in costly information gathering if they wish to vote. Second, we expect that the entry of new parties should have a positive effect on turnout as new parties mobilize previously unengaged voters or those with tenuous partisan loyalties. Third, the entry of credible independent candidates should have a similarly positive influence on turnout.

Abstract: Does the nature of political competition influence voter turnout? Whereas prior research exploring this link focuses on the number of parties and the competitiveness of races, we hypothesize that the entry and exit of parties should also affect turnout. Building on research on the costs of voting and voting as a habit, we identify and test three hypotheses linking party system change to turnout. First, we expect that turnout should decrease when major parties exit the party system, as some set of voters can no longer vote for their preferred party and must engage in costly information gathering if they wish to vote. Second, we expect that the entry of new parties should have a positive effect on turnout as new parties mobilize previously unengaged voters or those with tenuous partisan loyalties. Third, the entry of credible independent candidates should have a similarly positive influence on turnout. We test these hypotheses on district-level data from Indian national elections from 1977 through 2004. Regression analysis using fixed effects models reveals consistent evidence in favor of all three hypotheses.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The elected representatives of India : MPs, MLAs and others (CERI-Sciences Po, Paris)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5B195693-1B1A-4498-9E77-B5C753DFA3DA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This workshop focused on the network theme around the social profile of elected representatives within Indian states, with discussions of future planned publications led by the French partners.

In the research proposal we had proposed to study the following themes:

? to explore voter motivations to vote in electing different tiers of government
? whether voters were moving from identity related to issue based motivations
? to study if this was as true in cities, if not in villages 
? what is the nature of caste and religion based politic in urban electoral spaces as compared to rural ones
? the changing profile of elected representatives - including MLAs, members of Panchayats and urban municipal corporations
? role of local dynasties and resilience of patronage in electoral politics
? to explore the complementarity of survey-based and ethnographic approaches in the study of elections
? to focus in particular on state and Panchayat elections

The network brought together researchers based at Sciences Po (Jaffrelot), colleagues in JNU (Kanungo) and BR Ambedkar University (Narender Kumar), Kings India Institute (Tillin) and LSE (Banerjee) as well as Janaagraha in Bangalore. In the final conference, we revisited these themes through the fresh research that has been conducted by members of the network over the past few years and to engage in conversation colleagues who have been working on related themes. These include those focused more on clientelism (and transitions from it, including the impact of changing patterns of service delivery) (Chandra), dynastic politics (Chandra, Jensenius), the particular trajectories of politics in urban areas (Bjorkman), the variation in electoral politics across India's states and the role of identity (caste, religion, gender etc) in determining election outcomes (Jensenius, Heath, Chibber). We also intend to invite scholars who have been part of this project through their writing and active participation working on related issues (Sinha, Vaid, Uday Chandra) to comment and engage on the outcomes of the EECURI project and to take conversations forward. 

We also discussed how to build on the network activities through future publication and grant applications.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c7d910043fc6.00835386</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Studying Elections: Reflections on Methods (JNU workshop)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1EA0483F-47F3-4AC1-8948-5A2460112A3A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A workshop led by Indian partner JNU to look at questions around research methodologies for studying elections in India from ethnography (discussions led by the LSE team) to quantitative and survey research.

Key overarching questions for our network included whether Indian voters are shifting from identity and patronage-based to issue-based motivations for voting; the impact of urbanisation on electoral patterns; and what explains the behaviour of voters at different levels of election (village, state and national). Original research by members of the UK-based team of this India-Europe research network has focused on two major themes under these overarching questions:

1) ISSUES, PATRONAGE AND IDENTITIES IN ELECTIONS 
Oliver Heath and Louise Tillin conducted original survey research in 2013-14 to assess government performance versus patronage as explanations for voter behaviour. A survey conducted across two central Indian states found that where institutional performance is stronger and service delivery more reliable, voters are less responsive to small clientelistic inducements to vote (such as small sums of money or gifts in kind), but as the size of clientelistic inducement increases the effects of institutional performance on voter behaviour declines.

Further research by Heath in collaboration with other network members (Sanjay Kumar and Gilles Verniers) conducted in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh has looked at aspects of identity, including the effects of co-religiosity on voter behaviour. They found that Muslims are more likely to vote for Muslim candidates, but only when those candidates have a realistic chance of winning - there is thus a strong strategic element to their vote calculus. Moreover, they show that Hindus do not discriminate against Muslim candidates, and that parties do not face an electoral penalty for fielding a Muslim candidate.

Further survey research was conducted during state elections in Kerala, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Assam in June 2016, which looked among other things at the impact of welfare provision on voting patterns. This data is still being analysed and will result in subsequent publications.
 
2) WHY DO VOTERS VOTE? 
Ethnographic research coordinated by Mukulika Banerjee and her team members (including Manisha Priyam and Sarthik Bagchi) in seven field sites in local, state and national elections has focused on the question of why amidst (and notwithstanding) severe disadvantage and deprivation, voters turn out in large numbers in Indian elections. The field work and research done for this project has led to considerable advancement of thinking on the issues that voters consider significant while making their electoral choices. The ethnographies unravel the embedded contexts within which voter deliberations are done, as also the meanings they attach to this activity. Both the context and the meaning are missed out in large-scale surveys of voter-opinions and political trends. Besides, new efforts have been made to fine-tune the research methods to cover urban areas, which involve a significant difference of context, and are under-researched as yet. 

In addition to ethnographic studies, other members of the UK-based team have used quantitative methodologies to understand variation in election turnout. Oliver Heath and Adam Ziegfeld have used quantitative methods to understand factors impinging on levels of turnout. Their research has looked at the impact of new parties on levels of turnout. 

Network activities overall have included methodology workshops and future planned publications to investigate the contribution of mixed method research to understanding the question of turnout and why voters vote.

In addition to these two major themes, other members of the UK-based team have studied electoral patterns in individual states; and furthered capacity building aims of the original grant proposal including supporting research activities at partner NGO Janaagraha, and by involving PhD students from partner institutions in conferences and publications of the network.

IN ADDITION:
There are many activities undertaken as part of this network grants that relate to networking activities which were central to this grant (but which are difficult to report in the researchfish format). All members of the UK team have attended the workshops and conferences organised by our partners in India and France, as well as organising workshops and conferences in the UK. These activities are mentioned in passim under the various headings in researchfish (for eg. where they have enabled new collaborations, or involved presentation of research findings that have subsequently been published). But it should be noted that these meetings also constitute a stand-alone element of the overall work under the research grant.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Findings on public service delivery and voter behaviour will be of interest to government and third sector organisations in India interested in questions of accountability and improving policy outcomes for the poor. We intend to publish both in academic venues and more publicly accessible venues in India such as Economic and Political Weekly to enhance the impact and accessibility of our findings. Survey data analysed in the publications has been made available via the UK data service where practicable. 

Ethnographic and quantitative analysis of electoral participation and turnout levels will be of value to partners such as the Election Commission of India, who have been key interlocutors for this project (the former Chief Election Commissioner of India, for instance, has attended two workshops of the network in London).

Furthermore, the research on election dynamics conducted by the multiple members of the network is of relevance to a wide range of organisations including the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, international media, emerging market risk analysts and business communities - we are engaged with such bodies in multiple ways, and as our research reaches fruition seek to further our dissemination activities to reach broader audiences as well as academic peers.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C2FD014B-B225-4C29-8372-58BDDFD3D6F1</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5462903880b892.75956653</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Participation in South Asia Advisory Board, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Tillin)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AA17DDC1-9D80-43E1-9935-6369C61D4B35</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546369f71227a8.73936299</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>This survey was conducted in Tamil Nadu during the 2016 Assembly elections.
