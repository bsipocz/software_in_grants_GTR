Insulin resistance (IR)-mediated metabolic disease pose a major public health problem. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR?) is an important regulator of insulin sensitivity; PPAR? full agonists such as rosiglitazone reduce insulin resistance however also cause a number of serious adverse effects. Partial PPAR? agonists such as telmisartan show similar beneficial effect on insulin sensitivity without any considerable side effects; but no PPAR? partial agonist is currently used in clinical practice. The team at Liverpool have characterised the metabolic beneficial effects of telmisartan, an angiotensin receptor blocker, using in vitro adipocyte models; this has also led to a NIHR-funded clinical trial (TAILoR) to investigate the beneficial effect of telmisartan on IR in HIV patients. Telmisartan, even if shown successful in our trial, has some limitations. Conventional development of partial PPAR? agonists may be time consuming and expensive; drug repurposing offers an alternate faster route to achieve this. The team will undertake a quantitative proteomic approach to characterise and compare the proteomic signature of both rosiglitazone and telmisartan to identify the desirable proteome signature for an ideal drug and use signature matching as a strategy for drug repurposing applications in the treatment of metabolic disease.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>EmulTech B.V.</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Netherlands, Kingdom of the</gtr:country><gtr:description>Partnership between Marco Giardiello and Emultech B.V</gtr:description><gtr:id>80350311-0EAE-42E0-A97B-50823B02634C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The project is ongoing and is yet to produce outputs.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c28e3bf0e226.70685828-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>EmulTech B.V. is a company active in the field of Drug Delivery.

Additionally, they will give training and consultancy inits use and provide optimisation support throughout small laboratory to industrial manufacturing scale up.

The prime objective of the project is to evaluate the high throughput microfluidic system, the INFINITY Mini (developed by partner company EmulTech B.V.) for the preparation of uniform emulsions with droplet sizes in the range of 5 to 100 micron in volumes of 1mlto 1Litre. Importantly, the INFINITY Miniis designed with cGMP-production in mind. The closed system with disposable wetted components is easily adapted to an aseptic process, which is critical for drug product manufacture towards human clinical studies. Thus, the integration of such a reproducible microfluidic system into the drug formulation spray drying platform will enhance achievement of SON cGMP manufacture for a variety of AP ls on an industrial scale.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Oxford Nanopore Technologies</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Partnership between Alistair Darby (Centre for Genomic Research) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies Ltd.</gtr:description><gtr:id>6FA90A8C-97F3-450D-9478-5D92EABFD2FA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This project is ongoing and has not produced outputs yet.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bfebff0b62b5.63540966-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Whole genome sequencing can be used to identify genes responsible for AMR. There are now a number of sequencing technologies that make it possible to sequence and analyse the complete genome of a bacteria in &amp;lt; 24 hrs. However, there is only one sequencing technology, the Minion, Oxford Nanopore Technologies Ltd. that can provide real-time sequencing information. The ON technology has the unique ability to sequence single DNA molecules and provide sequencing information that can be analysed &amp;quot;on the fly&amp;quot;. ONP have offered to provide consumables for the project and technical support for the sequencing and bioinformatics.

The Centre for Genomic Research will investigate how the ON sequencer can be used to provide rapid identification of infectious agents and identify genes involved in AMR from a clinical sample.

The project proposed to develop a bench top instrument for the application of sub cellular infrared (IR) imaging to the diagnosis of oesophageal cancer. This is a new approach to cancer diagnosis that has the potential to significantly improve the accuracy of diagnosis based on the traditional H and E staining approach. The technique is to apply scanning near field microscopy (SNOM) at infrared wavelengths to obtain chemical maps of tissue with sub cellular spatial resolution (0.1micron). The approach was pioneered by the Liverpool group with the establishment of a SNOM on the IR free electron laser (FEL) on the ALICE accelerator at Daresbury. However whereas the technique has considerable potential the requirement of an FEL means that it is both impractical and too expensive for clinical use. Preliminary studies in collaboration with ASH Scientific Ltd who manufacture quantum cascade lasers (QCL) have established that the FEL can be replaced by a QCL. This will make it possible to design a bench top instrument for use close to clinic. The team will work with ASH Scientific in a five month programme to optimise the interface between the QCL and the SNOM and demonstrate using oesophageal cells and tissue that the bench top instrument will produce the same results as the IR FEL SNOM combination.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Meso Scale Delivery</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Partnership between Prof Enitan Carrol and Meso Scale Discovery</gtr:description><gtr:id>450246E4-C2AB-4E1A-8507-541FC207EC6B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This project is on-going and has not produced outputs yet.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bff106eadc84.08965152-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) is a global leader in the development, manufacture, and commercialization of innovative multiplex assays for the measurement of molecules in biological samples.
