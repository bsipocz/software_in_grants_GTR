The view that `there is no period so remote as the recent past' (Bennett) has direct resonance for apartheid. In the case of the Nazi past, key elements - notably the holocaust - were obscured or passed over for a generation after 1945, just as important aspects of Franco's regime in Spain have been occluded since its demise 1975. Much the same might be said in the case of apartheid, which was consigned to history twenty years later. A new generation has grown up without direct memories of apartheid and without the intellectual framework to make sense of the system as a whole. My aim is to write a sophisticated but accessible analytical text about apartheid, which views the system as a totality, reinterprets its significance for contemporary audiences, poses new questions about its history, and takes close account of the detailed research that has been conducted in the past ten years by younger scholars with specialist interests. 

Apartheid dominated South African politics and society over the second half of the twentieth century. It was preceded by the system of racial segregation which, from the start of the century, established many of apartheid's key institutional, political and ideological building blocks. After Nazi Germany there was no society elsewhere in the world (including the American South) in which colour-based discrimination was more over or deeply entrenched in law. Yet, while many people are broadly familiar with apartheid as concept, its inner complexities and workings are much less well understood. After 1948 apartheid increasingly became the focus of the global movement to eradicate racism and colonialism. The apartheid state nevertheless managed to cultivate considerable international support by projecting the country as a guarantor of `western' values and anti-communism during the cold war. Apartheid was a highly divisive and emotive political issue which helped to shape the modern world.

A feature of the established literature on apartheid is the tendency to see its development either as a rational response to the `needs' of capital or as the natural consequence of racially-obsessed Afrikaner nationalism. This is mirrored by an African nationalist interpretation that focuses on the liberation struggle to the exclusion of the state and posits the ultimate victory of the African National Congress as somehow inevitable. Teleologies such as these will be challenged throughout this book. This account will stress contingency and paradox over certitude and inevitability. It will neither presume apartheid's rise nor its fall and it pay close attention to key moments when South Africans of all colours and classes found themselves confounded by the pace and possibility of events.

This project will build upon a substantial body of historical, sociological and political literature in order to suggest new lines of enquiry and to destabilize orthodoxies old and new. My `History of Apartheid' will pay attention as well to little used or forgotten texts: newspapers, fiction, memoirs, and political ephemera. Newly available archival materials (including official and private papers) and recent memoirs, biographies, and autobiographies will be used, particularly those relating to the anti-apartheid movement and key politicians. Extensive use will be made of the substantial body of research theses which have been written in the post-apartheid era, whose insights have yet to be fully absorbed and synthesized.

The originality of this project rests on (i) on my capacity to situate political, institutional, intellectual, social and cultural histories in the same frame of analysis and (ii) write a history for a present-day global-minded audience that is now a generation removed from the late-apartheid era.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The first constituency likely to benefit is the academic community. I define this broadly, mindful of the fact that Britain's reputation as an international destination for foreign graduate students depends on demonstrable global expertise. My New History of Apartheid will help to maintain Britain's reputation as a centre of African studies. Written in an accessible but also rigorous academic style, suitable for students, academics and members of the general public, it will provide historical context and depth. A previous book on the history of the ANC (2000), seems to have found such a wider audience: for example, it has just been translated into Arabic, an initiative led by the South African Consulate in Damascus, and it was recommended by an American diplomat resident in South Africa as an excellent guide to the country's politics. 

A second constituency likely to benefit from my work are journalists and the media. In the run-up to the 20th anniversary of the ending of the apartheid regime (1994) it is probable that there will be a fair deal of media attention. I am regularly approached by broadcasting outlets to comment on South African current affairs and to provide historical context. In the past few years I have been interviewed on BBC radio 4, BBC News 24, BBC Worldwide and Nightwaves, as well as Melvyn Bragg's `In Our Time'. It is hoped that non-academic beneficiaries will include radio listeners in this country and abroad who will gain from a deeper understanding of contemporary South Africa. 

I have been invited to submit a treatment to the BBC in association with Eve Streeter, a senior producer with Pier Productions, for a multi-part history of apartheid for the `Definitive Histories' series. If commissioned, the series may also be broadcast on the BBC World Service. Pier Productions is a major supplier of drama and factual programming to BBC radio, including the long-running Making History weekly strand, and makes television documentaries and educational material for the Open University. I shall be proposed as the presenter of this series on apartheid, timed for the run-up to the 20th anniversary of the first democratic elections in South Africa. The proposal will go forward in mid-April. If commissioned, work on this radio program would overlap with this academic project and provide an ideal means for dissemination of its key findings to a non-academic audience.

My work on South Africa has had influence on museums and galleries, based on previous historical work. I have been invited to comment on the photography of Jo Ractliffe, who has done important work in Angola - centering on the issue of 'the border' in the context of war in the 1970s. This will take place at the V&amp;amp;A in April as part of a show curated by Professor Tamar Garb. I have been invited to a conference of musicologists in Rome in July 2012 on `Musics, Cultures, Identities', to provide historical perspective on the unique Grey collection of ethnological artifacts housed at the South African Library. A conference based on the Grey Collection is being planned at the SA Library at a future date. There is no direct connection here with my proposed work on apartheid, other than the fact that my reputation as a South African historian is making some general impact in the 3rd sector. 

In association with the University's wider participation strategy, I shall offer to give talks to local sixth-form colleges to publicise my work on apartheid and attract students into higher education. I also propose to contact the South African high commissioner in London with a view to offering lectures relevant to the anniversaries of the ANC centenary (2012) and the South African liberation (2014). 

To the extent that my work helps to to maintain this country's reputation as a repository of specialist knowledge of global relevance, I trust that it will contribute to Britain's economic and social development.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>91460</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/J003212/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>319D6F57-4306-40E8-9F0A-84D514AAF7FC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Imperial/Colonial History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3CE20DB9-873E-489F-BBC7-3F05BD0D900C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EF860896-6A4B-4EF6-A42E-F78E49ED901F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Post-Colonial Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
