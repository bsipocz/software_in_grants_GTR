Damage to a part of the brain called the 'hippocampus' leaves people unable to make memories lasting longer than a few minutes, leaving them trapped in a 'permanent present', unable to keep a conscious record of what has happened to them since their injury. 
 During childhood, the ability of the hippocampus to make and store memories of events develops late. Although some types of memories, such as the ability of a child to recognise their mother, develop very early, the ability to remember specific events, together with the time and the place in which they happened ('episodic' memory) does not emerge until at least three years of age. At these early ages, sometimes the 'sense' of a memory may be present, but the time or the place of the event may be wrong, or a child may correctly store a memory, but forget it after a short time. Most astonishingly of all, all memories that are made before 3.5 years of age are bound to be forgotten in adulthood, a phenomenon described as 'infantile amnesia'.
 The development of episodic memory in children has been subject to much research over the past decades, such that we have a good understanding of the psychology of memory development. However, little is known of the development of the brain systems that underlie episodic memory, in particular how the activity of the neurons in the hippocampus changes during development. We plan to investigate this problem for the first time by studying the development of the memory properties of hippocampal neurons in rats. The hippocampus has a role not just in general episodic memory, but also spatial memory in particular. At a neural level, spatial memory in the hippocampus is based on neurons which discharge action potentials dependent on the position of the animal (these neurons are extensively studied in the rats, but also exist in humans). Importantly, these spatial neurons, or 'place cells' can remember the location at which they are active over long periods (days), and hence are thought to directly sustain spatial memories in the hippocampus. 
 We will test the ability of the place cells to form stable spatial memories at different times during development. We will test how well place cells form a memory after a single short exploration of a new place, akin to an episodic memory. In order to permanently store a memory, it not only needs to be created (a short-term process) but also 'consolidated', meaning laying down long-term changes to neural connections. The way in which place cells are re-actived during the periods immediately following exploration (for example, during sleep), is thought to be a mechanism for consolidating spatial memories: we will therefore test when this sleep reactivation emerge during development. Finally, we will investigate the role of dopamine in the development of memory. Dopamine is a chemical with many important influences on brain and behaviour, including motivation, mood and motor (movement) activity. Here, we will test a specific function of dopamine in the hippocampus: that it acts as a signal which instructs the hippocampus to consolidate long-term memories, and we will specifically test whether the late development of this signal is responsible for the late development of episodic memory.
 Understanding the development of the hippocampal formation at the neuronal level in the rat will give us a good handle on understanding these developmental processes in the human. This is particularly important given the susceptibility of the hippocampal formation of babies to damage during perinatal deprivation of oxygen. Understanding hippocampal formation development will be important to enable an accurate diagnosis when damage has occurred, and knowing how experience affects the development of the hippocampal system may allow compensatory behavioural therapies to be developed.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Our ability to form memories of our personal experiences (or 'episodic' memories, memories of events set in a spatial-temporal context) emerges late during post-natal development, and episodic memories formed early in childhood are destined to be forgotten by adulthood, a phenomenon termed 'infantile amnesia'. The protracted development of memory systems is common to many altricial mammalian species, offering the possibility of studying memory development in animal models. In this proposal, we aim to uncover the fundamental mechanisms of memory development and infantile amnesia at the level of neural circuits, by studying the development of hippocampal networks for memory in the rodent. The hippocampus is required to create new episodic and spatial memories in both humans and other species. At the level of neural circuits, the hippocampus represents space through the firing of pyramidal cells active only when the animal visits a restricted region of their environment, known as 'place cells'. This application will test the hypothesis that the developmental emergence of hippocampal memory is based on the place cell network's ability to encode and consolidate long-term memories of locations. Firstly, we will assess the ability of place cells in the developing hippocampus to encode long-term memories for locations during exploration, and we will identify which synaptic plasticity mechanisms are involved in this process at any given age. Then, we will investigate the patterns of place cell activity observed during immobility or sleep following exploration ('place cell re-activation'), which may reflect network mechanisms for memory consolidation (both intra-hippocampally, and in the interplay between hippocampal and pre-frontal cortex circuits). Finally, we will test whether the late development of memory is due to the slow maturation of a dopaminergic neuromodulatory signal in the hippocampus, as this has been shown to promote consolidation after learning in the adult.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research will advance our understanding of the post-natal development of episodic and spatial memory. As such, it will provide potential long-term benefit in the assessment and therapy of human developmental neurological disease, increase understanding of the role of sleep for memory function during childhood, lead to a better knowledge of developmental spatial cognition, tangible economic benefits and increase public understanding of science.

Long-term health benefits in developmental neurological disease: Perinatal asphyxia occurs in 1-6 per 1000 full-term births, and the hippocampus is particularly vulnerable to ischemic damage. Our research, by providing insight into key mechanisms of memory formation in childhood, promises to provide the missing link between hippocampal network and cognitive function, promising to 1) address why only a subset of those affected by hypoxia will later develop memory problems, and 2) provide sensitive diagnostic tools to detect hippocampal dysfunction early during life. Early diagnosis could then translate into early intervention.

An understanding of the role of sleep consolidation in infant learning and memory: Sleep disturbances are associated with cognitive deficits, including memory difficulties, in school-age children, and some reports suggest that similar problems are also seen in pre-school children. As this proposal aims to investigate the role of sleep consolidation in the development of hippocampal memories, it is ideally placed to tell us the fundamental neuroscience of when and how network consolidation in sleep is related to the emergence of hippocampal memory (corresponding to episodic memory in children, at around 3 years of age). We will also engage directly with nurseries and schools to disseminate our findings directly to young children's carers (and young children themselves). Through talks and interventions facilitated by the UCL centre for educational neuroscience, we will reach the appropriate audience to disseminate our findings and translate them into informed practice.

Spatial cognition and the built environment: Understanding spatial cognition can influence thinking about the architectural design of the spaces we live in. The workshop 'Spatial thinking', held at the Bartlett School of Architecture, UCL, was an example of such cross disciplinary interface. One project discussed was the design of facilities for young children, whose spatial cognition and memory is not yet adult-like.

Technology-transfer: The applicant has close links with Axona Ltd, a company based in Hertfordshire, UK, which manufactures electrophysiological recording equipment for sale around the world. There is continuing knowledge-transfer and/or technology-transfer in both directions between the applicant and the company. In particular, the use of this equipment in young rats has led to a constant drive for miniaturisation, meaning that very high densities of recording channels are now available, making the company a world-leader compared with other suppliers of similar equipment. 

Collaboration with industry: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias typically involve the degeneration of the hippocampal formation. The applicant was involved in one of the first studies to test place cells in a mouse model of AD, in collaboration with Dr Paul Chapman at GSK. We believe that our approach of combining in vivo recording, behavioural and biochemical testing will become standard in screening animal models of neurological disease in general, including (relevant to this application) developmental neurological disease.

Public engagement in Science: We will convey our results directly to the public via a variety of media channels. For example, the publication of our developmental research work (Wills, et al, 2010) led to features (including interviews) on New York Public Radio, New Scientist, Scientific American and the London Metro newspaper.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>386370</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6599E989-7F62-4B3D-8517-BFFA4690D9D9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Self-Organized Attractor Dynamics in the Developing Head Direction Circuit.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Current biology : CB</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/07f83083b115d3485d8d23a96d04d02d"><gtr:id>07f83083b115d3485d8d23a96d04d02d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bassett JP</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0960-9822</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a995f60915c07.64442850</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/N026012/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>041997EB-CFD8-493D-B0F8-DFA35451D0BE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Neurological</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>CF950C9A-DB16-4E23-8AEB-94548777BCA1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>1.1  Normal biological development and functioning</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
