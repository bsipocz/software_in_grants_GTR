Police on horseback are used primarily in public-order police work, particularly in the policing of large crowds, as well as for a number of other functions such as urban patrols. Mounted police represent a symbol of physical force as well as a connection to past eras of policing. They are thought to calm crowds and avert disorder in ways ?standard? police activity cannot. They are also among the most poorly-understood tools in modern public police work.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In current conditions of austerity mounted police are, like many other police units or activities, under threat of retrenchment or elimination. Yet policy decisions are being undertaken without recourse to evidence, since virtually no focused research has ever been conducted with mounted police. There is no empirical basis on which to make claims regarding their utility.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project will investigate the ways in which mounted police work is experienced in the UK through a unique observational methodology, alongside focus groups with police officers and citizens. This research will build an evidence base for future strategies and priorities regarding mounted policing. The project is supported by the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) and mounted police units across the UK.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The public-sector impact of this research at the local and national levels will be significant. It will be undertaken in an environment including multiple stakeholders who are actively seeking an evidence-based approach to policy-making regarding mounted police. By developing accounts of police practice alongside examining citizen perspectives on the use of mounted police, the project will create knowledge relevant to multiple audiences including practitioners, policymakers, and civil society groups, as well as to police internationally. It will produce reports and events for dissemination of research to project partners, alongside multiple academic publications.

Dissemination activities with government and police stakeholders are already agreed with project partners, and the project has secured multiple avenues for communicating its findings. The level of police interest in this project is clearly articulated in the attached Letter of Support. The research will be the first of its kind, and therefore will be foundational in shaping future police and strategy decisions in this unique area of police activity.

The project will primarily benefit UK police forces. It will directly address user questions relating to the choices facing UK police agencies regarding the elimination, reduction, or amalgamation and centralization of mounted police units. It will also answer broader questions relating to their specific and general effectiveness in policing tasks, as well as their legitimacy in the eyes of citizens.

The research process has been designed to engage police stakeholders during all phases of the project, and its findings will be directly and immediately applicable to operational decision-making by mounted unit managers and Chief Constables of jurisdictional forces. Many police forces in the UK that do not maintain a mounted capacity nonetheless utilize mounted police through mutual assistance agreements. The research will thus be relevant to police forces with mounted units as well as those without. 

The project's findings will also provide grounding for strategic decision-making and priority-setting by Police and Crime Commissioners, local Policing and Crime Panels, and the Home Office regarding the arrangement of mounted police in the UK. The project will be relevant to police internationally where mounted deployments are used including in North America and Europe. The findings should also be of interest to civil society groups such as the Police Foundation who seek to understand the relationships between public police and citizens. 

The project will be housed at the Centre for Criminology, University of Oxford, and will be funded in part by Avon and Somerset Constabulary on behalf of the Association of Chief Police Officers Mounted Working Group. Member forces of the Working Group have committed significant in-kind resources to ensure the research team can collect necessary data, as outlined in the project partner Letter of Support. The project's governance structure includes regular meetings with police partners, ensuring relevance of findings to practitioners and ultimate public-sector impact of the research. The research will create multiple opportunities to maximize dissemination to relevant groups, as outlined in the Pathways to Impact attachment.

Its findings will also likely generate mass media content. Indeed, the current phase at Oxford has already received attention in the Independent, the Daily Mail, the Police Oracle website, Horse and Hound Monthly, and multiple mentions on BBC Radio 4. This coverage suggests that the British public has an active stake in the outcomes of the austerity measures, and hold a strong symbolic attachment to horses as tools of police work. The research will directly engage members of the public for their views through focus group research, and will contribute to an informed public debate on the issues surrounding the future of mounted police activity in the UK.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>55066</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Avon and Somerset Constabulary</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Avon and Somerset</gtr:description><gtr:id>3096F7C2-B461-4B89-BC55-95F95A5F92C3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The entire project is in a sense an outcome from this collaboration as it would not have taken place without the support of Avon and Somerset.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545b5e3373d717.72401734-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Our police partners contributed to the infrastructure of the project throughout - for example, providing police resources for a quasi-experiment investigating the effect of mounted police patrols on public trust and confidence, and paying for the associated survey.

This event was be attended by over 100 people: academics; police representatives from the UK and overseas; the College of Policing; Police and Crime Commissioners, Home Office representatives and others involved in the governance of policing. However the main audience was police officers/practitioners, and there were police from across the UK, Europe, and North America in attendance. As such the likely eventual audience is likely to be far larger - for example, we shared our slides with police from Spain and the Czech Republic.

Discussion during and around the symposium suggested that the research findings had shifted views of the use of mounted units, particularly in relation to the utility of their deployment in neighbourhood settings.

The Police and Crime Commissioner for Gloucestershire (which does not have a mounted unit) is now seeking to set up an agreement with Avon and Somerset (which does) to shared mounted resource.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54883acedc6886.92974962</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:presentationType>keynote/invited speaker</gtr:presentationType><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Paper given at the N8 Policing Research Partnership International Conference - Working with the Police on Policing</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>27A209D6-62C0-451E-A85D-36D747831C88</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation entitled 'Experiments in policing and the challenges of implementation', which drew on the quasi-experiment conducted during the Making and Breaking Barriers project to explore some of the perils and pitfalls - and avenues for success - associated with experimental research in policing.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bec3a5232251.00100429</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seminar given at the Houses of Parliament as part of a programme of events hosted by the University of Oxford</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>63337DFF-4ED7-4657-8CC5-9E5B3A048E86</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Seminar entitled 'Police: Symbolic and Effective Guardians', which drew partly on research from the Making and Breaking Barriers project.

First, to present our findings to groups of 'critical friends', who could in a sense validate the research or let us know were we were going wrong. Second, to provide an opportunity for those groups of officers to feed into the research in a more formal sense, for example by pointed out areas of interest we may have missed

We were able both to improve the quality of the final piece of research and highlight its results to police who use or work with mounted police on a day-to-day basis.

Our findings have already been used to inform work conducted by the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO), and in particular its 'Mounted Working Group'; and to help inform funding decisions taken by police organisations in the UK and elsewhere. 

Specifically, findings from the project have been used:
- In the development of national guidance on mounted police within the ACPO operational support management area;
- To inform moves toward development of a collaborative arrangement between Gloucestershire and Avon and Somerset constabularies for sharing of mounted resources;
- Form part of a forthcoming (as of December 2014) presentation by DCC Rod Hansen at the January 2015 National Chief Constables Council;
- Provide evidence for decisions on whether to retain or abolish the South Yorkshire police mounted unit; and
- Provide evidence that help inform a decision to retain a mounted unit in Western Australia.

We hosted a national mounted police symposium in Oxford on the 19th November 2014 to present the findings of the project and launch its final report. This event was be attended by over 100 people: academics; police representatives from the UK and overseas; the College of Policing; Police and Crime Commissioners, Home Office representatives and others involved in the governance of policing. 

The project has received considerable press attention, with both Giacomantonio and Bradford being interviewed by local television and radio stations across the country. There have also been several reports on the project in the printed media, and on the day of the symposium we were for a while the first listed item on the BBC website (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-30101091). There have also been stories in national newspapers, including the Daily Telegraph and Daily Mail.

All members of the research team are currently involved in bid to the Police Innovation Fund, lead by Gloucestershire and Avon and Somerset Police. This will build on key aspects of the research already conducted, most importantly in relation to developing mounted police as a shared resource between the two forces, and developing a Randomized Controlled Trial to investigate the effect of mounted patrols in crime 'hotspots'.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>B5B76EBA-F06C-4113-A038-814E993FF823</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545105f9289689.98183048</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project has constituted the first formal academic investigation into the use of mounted police, certainly in the UK and possibly in the world. Run as a knowledge exchange project in conjunction with Gloucestershire and Avon and Somerset police, the over-arching aim of the project was to provide evidence to contribute to pressing decisions regarding the future of mounted units in the UK. The aim was to consider ways in which the relative value of mounted police work may be measured and understood, as well as provide evidence testing the value of mounted police in various deployment scenarios. The aims of the project have been met, and our police partners will use the research to guide decision-making moving forward (see the narrative impact).

The research undertaken for this project was multi-method and exploratory in nature, and the project has examined mounted police in multiple deployment scenarios including neighbourhood policing, football policing and public order policing in festival and demonstration settings. This project also included research activities designed to understand the costs of mounted policing, and a survey of senior mounted police officers in other countries to understand the potential transferability of these findings.

Our findings coalesce around five main points.

1. While it is often assumed they are primarily a public order resource, mounted police spend substantially more time on neighbourhood-level patrol or supporting local policing than any other area of activity. We conducted a quasi-experiment (that was accompanied by systematic social observation of police patrols) investigating the effect of mounted community patrols on public perceptions of the police. This aspect of the research concluded that in neighbourhood settings, mounted police patrols are associated with higher levels of visibility, trust and confidence in police. Police horses seem to offer a highly symbolic resource that elicits positive responses from many people in neighbourhood settings.

2. In both neighbourhood and peaceful crowd settings, mounted police generate far greater levels of public engagement, by volume over similar time periods, than foot officers. This may have important implications for the types of relationships, both short-term and long-term, police are able to form with members of the public

3. Despite our initial expectations, in demonstration or public disorder settings mounted police do not seem to provide substantial public-engagement value, and their value in these situations appears mostly tactical. In specific instances where coercive crowd control is required, mounted police provide a unique capacity to control crowds that does not have an obvious equivalent amongst other available police tools. 

4. Based on our estimates, mounted police cost approximately &amp;pound;6,550 per annum more than officers in other operational support roles (e.g. dog units, armed police units). The total costs of mounted police is however only a very small proportion of the overall police budget - an average of 0.31% in the force areas that maintain mounted units

5. The use of horses in policing is relatively widespread across the developed world, and there are substantial points of commonality between the ways in which mounted police are used in the UK and the ways in which they are used in other countries.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings are already being used by our police partners in a number of ways, for example to help in resource allocation at various levels within the police service. Findings from the final report will feed into the work of ACPOs 'mounted working group'. Moreover, we have received requests for the final research findings from police in other countries including Australia, Denmark and Germany, for use in supporting organisational reform.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>39493A2C-6412-4BAD-9CC4-92DB2DFF9F2B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545108acec63e5.73782241</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.rand.org/randeurope/research/projects/mounted-police-uk.html</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>FCB0F8CF-DEB0-48CD-9880-F9EBD07204E5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Making and Breaking Barriers Assessing the value of mounted police units in the UK</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a7bb945b5d4ba334a08dfb18e3aad32c"><gtr:id>a7bb945b5d4ba334a08dfb18e3aad32c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Giacomantonio, G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58bec602f09ef9.03605828</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>842737B8-B220-4686-A2BF-9A685A401C4A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Making and Breaking Barriers Assessing the value of mounted police units in the UK: Summary report</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a7bb945b5d4ba334a08dfb18e3aad32c"><gtr:id>a7bb945b5d4ba334a08dfb18e3aad32c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Giacomantonio, G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58bec70fe284b1.18068670</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/L001918/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>020361E1-B8CA-49FD-9149-27D31D21C7A3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3E2F513B-B936-4DF8-B28D-0ADC57F8BFC7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Anthropological Methodology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>CB259E50-E91D-4DCD-A395-BF252E8692B8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Criminology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
