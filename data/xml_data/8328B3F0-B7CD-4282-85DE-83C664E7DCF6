Understanding the implications of urbanisation for species and populations is crucial for conservation biologists wishing to counteract negative effects. Urbanisation and human disturbance affect wildlife adversely by causing ecologically maladapted behaviours. Negative effects of increased anthropogenic noise, roads, industrial development and artificial lighting on wildlife have been identified. Although research is now addressing the impacts of anthropogenic noise, only recently has there been an interest in the ecological impacts of artificial light pollution associated with urbanisation. Light pollution is an increasing global problem affecting every inhabited continent, covering 100% of the land area in many countries. As human populations rise and become increasingly urbanised, levels of light pollution are set to increase globally. Being nocturnal, bats are among the groups most likely to be affected by light pollution, and respond as bioindicators to a range of factors associated with anthropogenic change. Together with their insect prey bats form an ideal system for investigating the impacts of light pollution. Almost a quarter of bat species globally are threatened, and the key underlying threat to populations is pressure on resources from increasing human populations. Bat habitats are under increasing disturbance from suburban development and its associated artificial lighting, and connectivity of habitat and foraging areas to roosts is fundamental to the survival of many bat populations. In the UK, threats to bat populations have resulted in populations becoming protected under UK and European legislation. During our previous research using field-based experiments we showed that the most common UK street-lights (high pressure sodium) fragment bat habitats, causing bats to change their behaviour with potentially negative conservation consequences. We provided new insights into the effects of light disturbance on wildlife. Our results suggest that the effect of light disturbance on bats varies between species and is therefore more complex than previously thought. Understanding the effects of light disturbance on bat spatial behaviour (foraging and commuting) is key to effective conservation management. Spatial behaviour patterns are the link between animals and their habitats. A disruption of the landscape may therefore interfere with critical ecological processes necessary for population persistence and the maintenance of biodiversity. Understanding the foraging and ranging behaviour of animals in relation to light disturbance will help us to understand how populations adapt to environmental change and the future challenges posed by increasing urbanisation. Having identified a negative effect of lighting on bats we have established the foundation upon which to study effects on individual behaviours. This will expand our understanding of the impacts of light disturbance in the context of likely fitness consequences. We will also study the impacts of emerging lighting technologies that will soon become widespread both on bat behaviour and on insect abundance, diversity, and evasive responses to bat echolocation. In collaboration with policy makers, project results will be used to create a guidance manual to inform stakeholders such as developers, ecologists and planners, working with bats and their prey in areas affected by light pollution. Our team is at the forefront of research on the biological impacts of light pollution, and arguably is the best suited team internationally to conduct this study. This project will directly achieve the key recommendation of the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution (2009) that NERC leads a pilot programme of research to explore the impacts of artificial light on populations and ecosystems.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The main beneficiaries are Statutory Nature Conservation Organisations (SNCOs) Natural England (NE), Countryside Council for Wales (CCW) and Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH); these organisations are policy makers and have a statutory requirement to protect all UK bat species and their roosts under the EU habitats directive. We will work with these SNCOs to produce a guidance document at project completion. During her PhD the R-Co-I was seconded to NE for 4 months, so has a good understanding of organisational needs and procedures, which will be key to successful engagement and knowledge-exchange with these users. Project outputs will enable them to inform and develop policy regarding the management of bat and insect habitats and roosts in areas of increasing urbanisation and light pollution. The service sector users who will benefit directly are Environmental Consultants. Under UK and EU legislation, consultants deal with issues of bat mitigation in their professional duties. Indirect service sectors benefiting include lighting professionals and manufacturers, planners, developers, Department of Transport, Local Authorities and UK Biodiversity Action Planners (BAP). At present there is no guidance on the impacts of lighting on bats and insects, or how and when to mitigate these impacts. The project results will inform the professional activities of a diverse range of service sectors and assist them to fulfil our legal obligations to protect UK bats. The R-Co-I, Research Assistant and Field Assistants will benefit from the project through provision of training and career development in the academic and applied research techniques, field survey methods and design. This will provide societal impacts in developing the pool of trained and experienced scientists and environmental consultants. We have had expression of interest from overseas organisations dealing with lighting and mitigation of the ecological effects of light pollution. Therefore results will be of use to consultants, conservation organisations, planners and developers on an international scale. Other users who will benefit are landowners, roost owners, farmers, wildlife managers/trusts, scientists and conservation organisations. We will engage directly with these users in a collaborative capacity by creating a project working committee for the development of a bats and lighting guidance document. We already have agreement from NE, CCW, Institution of Lighting Professionals (ILP), Local Authority Planners and ecological consultants to participate in the working group to develop the guidance document from project results. We will also invite representatives from Department for Transport and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to feed into this process. We will conduct two workshops in the final year to discuss and develop this document. This will allow us to engage directly with end users and bring science into policy. The workshops will be led by the project partner BCT, who have expertise in workshop development and organisation, assisted by the R-Co-I. This will build on existing links with these users and develop a professional working relationship between the project and the users in developing guidelines. Talks and Training Workshops: We will conduct talks and training workshops for these organisations &amp;amp; the public to disseminate results, give guidance and provide opportunities for feedback and questions. The R-Co-I will post results and updates on the project and partner (BCT) and collaborator (ILP) websites. The R-Co-I will also produce short articles and leaflets summarising project outputs and findings in professional, in-house magazines and journals as requested. Conference Attendance: The R-Co-I and Project Student will present results at international and national conferences which are attended by academics, conservation organisations, consultants, bat workers and voluntary organisations.

LED lighting is predicted to constitute 70 % of the outdoor and residential lighting markets by 2020. While the use of LEDs promotes energy and cost savings relative to traditional lighting technologies, little is known about the effects these broad-spectrum 'white' lights will have on wildlife, human health, animal welfare and disease transmission.
? We conducted field experiments to compare the relative attractiveness of four commercially available 'domestic' lights, one traditional (tungsten filament) and three modern (compact fluorescent, 'cool-white' LED and 'warm-white' LED), to aerial insects, particularly Diptera.
? We found that LEDs attracted significantly fewer insects than other light sources, but found no significant difference in attraction between the 'cool-' and 'warm-white' LEDs. Fewer flies were attracted to LEDs than alternate light sources, including fewer biting midges (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae). 
? Policy implications: Use of LEDs has the potential to mitigate disturbances to wildlife and occurrences of insect-borne diseases relative to competing lighting technologies. However, we discuss the risks associated with broad-spectrum lighting and net increases in lighting resulting from reduced costs of LED technology.
? We promoted the findings at an anniversary event hosted by our industry partners in A NERC IAA award (Integral LED) who are planning a press release about our findings. Integral LED may use our evidence to promote sales of their LED lights.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>56A916F2-BCD4-4067-9899-051C05B5E166</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56ddb310ada955.26140740</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Energy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have quantified the effects of emerging artificial lighting technologies on bats and insects. The insect work resulted in three key findings:

1. Moths show reduced anti-bat escape manoeuvres when subjected to playbacks of echolocation calls under LED street lights. A paper was published by Wakefield et al. (2015) (Royal Society Open Science 2: 150291).The light-emitting diode (LED) street light market is expanding globally, and it is important to understand how LED lights affect wildlife populations. We compared evasive flight responses of moths to bat echolocation calls experimentally under LED-lit and -unlit conditions. Significantly, fewer moths performed 'powerdive' flight manoeuvres in response to bat calls (feeding buzz sequences from Nyctalus spp.) under an LED street light than in the dark. LED street lights reduce the anti-predator behaviour of moths, shifting the balance in favour of their predators, aerial hawking bats.

2. Domestic LED lights attract fewer insects than 'traditional' domestic lights, and their reduced attraction of insect pest species such as biting midges could reduce risks of disease transmission (Wakefield et al. 2016 Ecology and Evolution DOI: 10.1002/ece3.2527).LED lighting is predicted to constitute 70% of the outdoor and residential lighting markets by 2020. While the use of LEDs promotes energy and cost savings relative to traditional lighting technologies, little is known about the effects these broad-spectrum &amp;quot;white&amp;quot; lights will have on wildlife, human health, animal welfare, and disease transmission. We conducted eld experiments to compare the relative attractiveness of four commercially available &amp;quot;domestic&amp;quot; lights, one traditional (tungsten filament) and three modern (compact fluorescent, &amp;quot;cool-white&amp;quot; LED and &amp;quot;warm-white&amp;quot; LED), to aerial insects, particularly Diptera. We found that LEDs attracted significantly fewer insects than other light sources, but found no significant difference in attraction between the &amp;quot;cool-&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;warm-white&amp;quot; LEDs. Fewer families were attracted to LEDs than alternate light sources, including fewer Culicoides midges (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae). Use of LEDs has the potential to mitigate disturbances to wildlife and occurrences of insect-borne diseases relative to competing lighting technologies. However, we discuss the risks associated with broad-spectrum lighting and net increases in lighting resulting from reduced costs of LED technology.

3. Novel metal-halide street lights emit UV wavelengths, and attract relatively large numbers of insects. Novel LKED streetlights attract similar insect numbers to traditional high pressure sodium (orange) laps (Wakefield et al. in review). Traditional, narrow-spectrum sodium street lights are being replaced by broad-spectrum lighting technologies globally. These new white lights require less energy to operate and are therefore considered 'eco-friendly'. However, little attention has been paid to the impacts these new broad-spectrum lights may have upon local wildlife populations. We experimentally compared insect attraction to traditional (high-pressure sodium [HPS]) and modern (metal halide [MH] and light-emitting diode [LED]) street lights using portable street lights and custom-made flight-intercept traps.Significantly more (approximately five times as many) insects were attracted to white MH street lights than white LED and HPS lights. MH lights also attracted a significantly greater diversity of insects. There was no statistical difference in attraction (abundance or richness) between LED and HPS. Policy implications: With the current, large-scale conversion to white lighting, these results give insight into how changes to street light technology may affect wildlife populations and communities. We recommend avoiding MH light installations and highlight the need to consider more than just energy efficiency when classifying lighting products as 'eco-friendly'.

We are in the process of relating the insect findings to changes in bat activity. UV emissions by lamps strongly increase the numbers of insects attracted, and consequently attract more bats of 'light exploiting' species.

1. In line with the insect findings, metal halide lamps attract more 'light exploiting' bats (Stone et al. 2015 Phil trans R Soc 370B: 20140127). Artificial light at night is a major feature of anthropogenic global change and is increasingly recognized as affecting biodiversity, often negatively. On a global scale, newer technology white lights are replacing orange sodium lights to reduce energy waste. In 2009, Cornwall County Council (UK) commenced replacement of existing low-pressure sodium (LPS) high intensity discharge (HID) street lights with new Phillips CosmoPolis white ceramic metal halide street lights to reduce energy wastage. This changeover provided a unique collaborative opportunity to implement a before-after-control-impact field experiment to investigate the ecological effects of newly installed broad spectrum light technologies. Activity of the bat species Pipistrellus pipistrellus, P. pygmaeus and Nyctalus/Eptesicus spp. was significantly higher at metal halide than LPS lights, as found in other studies of bat activity at old technology (i.e. mercury vapour) white light types. No significant difference was found in feeding attempts per bat pass between light types, though more passes overall were recorded at metal halide lights. Species-specific attraction of bats to the metal halide lights could have cascading effects at lower trophic levels. We highlight the need for further research on possible ecosystem-level effects of light technologies before they are installed on a wide scale.

2. As part of a NERC PhD studentship, we found that bat activity was similar around LED and sodium lamps, fitting with our data on insect abundance (Researchfish Award reference 1507353). However, some bat species that forage in woodland habitats appear light averse, and avoid light regardless of spectral content.&amp;nbsp;

3. We completed an experiment analysing the effects of novel lighting technologies on bat activity (measured by echolocation calls) and on the movement ecology of a light-averse species, the lesser horseshoe bat (studied by radio tracking). We monitored potential fitness proxies, such as time spent foraging, fidelity to foraging areas etc. in the tracking experiment. We presented green lights used to minimise collisions of migratory birds, red lights designed to minimise impacts off species sensitive to short wavelengths, white LEDs and orange sodium lamps along heavily used commuting routes. &amp;nbsp;Light-exploiting pipistrelle bat species showed increased activity in lit conditions, especially under green light. Light averse bat species avoided all light types, at least on the lit side of hedges. The tracked lesser horseshoe bats used the unlit side of the hedge, and we detected no effects of the light on foraging time, use of foraging patches, number of returns in the night. We are in the process of writing up the studies for publication.

4. We completed an experiment investigating the effects of two intensities of security lights on the emergence behaviour and use of the night time by radio-tagged light averse lesser horseshoe bats. Emergence timing and return to the roosts were negatively affected by the security lights. We are in the process of writing up the studies for publication.
