Over the last 20 years, aquaculture in the UK has developed into an industry worth well over &amp;pound;1 billion per year, dominated by Scottish salmon farming. To ensure that the industry can meet increasing demands for sustainable fish, the government is aiming to grow UK aquaculture production 25% by 2020. 

Infectious diseases are the most significant threat to the stability and future expansion of the aquaculture industry; much like in human cities, occasionally previous bacterial and viral infections can re-emerge in a fish farm or new infections can spread from other places. An infection outbreak can cause massive financial losses due to fish death, costs of expensive interventions, or the poor quality of the resulting fish flesh. Also, as for us humans, the best way to prevent disease outbreaks on fish farms is by vaccination; this strategy is so effective for bacterial diseases that the use of antibiotics in aquaculture has almost stopped completely. In fact, every salmon farmed in Scotland will have been vaccinated at least once in its life. 

While very successful for some diseases, fish vaccination in its current form also has a number of drawbacks; primary among these is that each fish has to be individually injected with a vaccine, which is quite a challenge considering more than 150,000 tonnes of salmon are produced each year! This is not only costly and time-consuming but can cause the fish to become stressed making them susceptible to other opportunistic infections. Second are the potential side-effects of the immune system stimulants (or 'adjuvants') present in the vaccination; the optimal formulation will have adjuvants strong enough to induce a robust immune response but not so strong hat they cause side-effects impacting the quality or welfare of the fish. Finally, some diseases have proven more challenging than others in terms of developing effective vaccines.

For these reasons, many scientists are trying to find better ways to administer fish vaccines and adjuvants, while looking for new ways to vaccinate against fish diseases where no vaccine yet exists. However, vaccine development and validation is a slow process that requires extensive scientific testing with living fish. Therefore, there is great interest in the development of approaches that will reduce the number of fish required for vaccine testing, while making the testing process more robust at the same time. With this in mind, our project aims to adapt a new 'proteomic' technology currently used in the study of human disease - to quickly and accurately monitor fish immune responses. The method allows extremely precise measurements of protein levels and will allow us to accurately monitor key factors involved in an effective immune response such as antibodies. Our approach will allow miniscule blood samples to be taken from the same fish many times during an immune response, which is an improvement on comparable existing methods that require much more blood and hence a lot more fish to be sacrificed during an experiment.

Overall, our approach will enable scientists in the aquaculture sector to accurately monitor changes in fish immune protein levels in response to new and existing vaccines - allowing them to gauge the strength of immune responses and to predict the level of immunity conferred, whilst using fewer fish than current testing protocols. This in turn should help new vaccines and novel methods of administration to come online much more quickly, which will feedback to have positive effects on the sustainability and growth of aquaculture in the UK and worldwide.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Aquaculture is the fastest expanding sector of food and animal production in the UK and this growth is threatened by emergent or existing diseases. As the industry is worth &amp;gt;&amp;pound;1 billion per annum, considerable effort is being directed into development of new and/or more efficacious fish vaccines with easier, less labour-intensive methods of administration. To evaluate immune protection, most research groups currently use a vaccination-challenge strategy with terminally acquired samples, combined with quantitative PCR measurements of immune gene mRNA levels for validation. Such approaches require large numbers of animals to obtain sufficient statistical power and provide only limited information on the nature and kinetics of the protective response. Therefore, the objective of this project is to develop a proteomics platform that will allow rapid, repeatable and accurate quantification of multiple proteins in minimally-manipulated fish plasma samples. To achieve our objective, we will develop targeted mass-spectrometry (TMS) methods exploiting a state-of-the-art Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap system. TMS proteomics is currently used mostly in clinical research and drug development and offers a number of routes to routinely quantify targeted proteins in complex biological samples down to ng/ml levels with high consistency and accuracy. Following optimisation, our final protocol will be combined with a non-lethal sampling technique allowing quantification of target immune proteins in plasma samples from individual rainbow trout over the course of an immune response. Our platform will enable scientists in the aquaculture sector to gain a more accurate and complete understanding of the immune response when testing new vaccines, adjuvants or modes of administration. In turn, this should shorten the time it takes for new and improved vaccines to come to market, while dramatically reducing the number of animals required relative to current testing protocols.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>This study will bring together experts in the fields of immunology, bioinformatics, proteomics and monoclonal antibody production to address one of the main limitations to the expansion of the UK aquaculture industry- the need to rapidly develop new/improved fish vaccines that can be administered quickly to protect stock from infection. We anticipate our research will have a variety of academic, industrial and economic impacts, in the UK and beyond, culminating in benefits to the wider public:

Scientific community: the most immediate impact of this work will be within the international group of researchers working on fish immunology and vaccine development. The ability to routinely and accurately measure immune proteins in plasma samples by targeted mass spectrometry (TMS) will allow scientists in academic and commercial sectors to gain a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of fish immune responses when testing new vaccines, adjuvants or modes of administration. The method can be easily adapted to blood markers indicative of other traits of interest in aquaculture, for example growth or stress. We anticipate that many researchers working in others areas of biology and with other species will also benefit from the TMS protocols we develop; in fact, in the post-genomic era, where costs of obtaining sequence data are relatively low, there are almost no limits to the potential uses of TMS for molecular studies in both model and non-model organisms, including several research areas prioritised by NERC and BBSRC. Thus this project will play an important role in promoting TMS outside of its current clinical applications.

Aquaculture industry: disease outbreaks can be catastrophic to the aquaculture industry; high mortality rates lead to severe financial losses, site closures and redundancies. The TMS platform developed in this project and follow up work should enable new and improved vaccines to come to market more quickly, thus helping to remediate costs of disease to aquaculture in the long-term. Scientists in the aquaculture sector will also be interested in TMS as a novel tool for diagnostics (e.g. to gauge physiological status of the fish) and/or to rapidly screen fish for infection (e.g. by detecting viral or bacterial proteins in a sample).

Government: given the importance of aquaculture to the UK economy, the UK and devolved Scottish governments have a shared interest in the industry's expansion and stability. However, in order to achieve government objectives to increase production by 25% by 2020, new and improved fish vaccines and administration methods will be needed. The development of TMS will provide essential information to enable this process. Our use of non-lethal sampling for this study will also encourage other groups to use the same technique, supporting government initiatives (i.e. NC3Rs) to reduce the number of animals used for research.

Students: we have a large undergraduate, post-graduate and post-doctoral community within the College of Life Sciences and Medicine at UoA; this project offers the opportunity to introduce them to an emergent technology and discuss its adaptation to new areas of research. 

Wider public: With concerns over dwindling wild fish stocks and increasing consumer demand for sustainably sourced fish, the aquaculture industry is under significant pressure to meet consumer demands. By facilitating the efficiency with which new vaccines can be tested and validated, our project will help the industry expand and meet these needs. Another area of public concern is the excessive use of antibiotics in the food production industry, a practice thought to have contributed to the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacterial strains. Due to the success of current fish vaccination programmes the use of antibiotics in UK aquaculture is low compared to other farmed animals, however the development of additional vaccines for fish bacterial diseases will ensure this continues.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>191505</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>BBSRC-NERC aquaculture workshop, London</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>40BD3C82-9D72-48B9-B709-97A285272F83</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Specialist workshop for scientists and industry leaders in aquaculture to meet and form new collaborations.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56bddae2e0abf6.56217842</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Marine Biotechnology Conference, 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4341E1AE-7AE9-4C11-A184-0AB94C710261</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited to give a keynote presentation on our project at 11th International Marine Biotechnology Conference held in Baltimore, USA.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b4db35f13e35.14861345</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Aquaculture Europe conference</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>356F44A9-907F-448F-9758-FA15B12AD45D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited to present at the BBSRC-NERC session at Aquaculture Europe Scotland held in Edinburgh.

However, fish, like any other species, are prone to infectious diseases and vaccination is widely considered to be the best way to protect farmed fish stocks from otherwise devastating disease outbreaks. For this reason scientists are working to develop vaccines against fish diseases where no vaccine yet exists and improve the efficacy of the vaccines in current use. In this project we set out to adapt a new 'proteomic' technology which will allow researchers to quickly and accurately measure fish immune responses, with the hope that it can be used to streamline the testing of new fish vaccines.

As the method we are developing requires only a drop or two of blood plasma to perform we were able to trial a new immunisation protocol, where a fish is immunised and tiny samples of blood taken periodically for comparison against a sample taken from the same fish before immunisation. We used rainbow trout (an important UK aquaculture species) to show that this new method works extremely well, with negligible impact upon the health and welfare of the fish being tested, allowing scientists to use far fewer fish when testing vaccines in the future than would be required using current methods. The proteomic technology we wanted to use for the analysis of our samples is a form of high-resolution mass spectrometry, performed on a quadrupole-equipped Orbitrap mass spectrometer (LC-QqOrbi-MS). Although such technology is routinely used in the study of human disease we first had to optimise it for use with our trout plasma samples; to this end we tested a range of sample preparation and machine run conditions to find those that allowed us to measure as many of the immune proteins present as possible (a so-called 'global analysis'). These conditions were then used to analyse the samples from our immunised trout enabling us to track the relative levels of 100+ different plasma proteins over the course of the immune response. This is the first time the immune response of fish has been looked at in such depth and, although we are still analysing the large amount of data generated, we already have an improved understanding of how the levels of proteins previously shown to be involved in fish immune protection change over time, as well uncovering a number of new targets which also appear to be playing a role and should certainly be investigated further. 
 
The final step of the project aimed to hone in on a few of the immune proteins identified in our global analysis, examining their expression in greater depth, while also trying to map a few of the proteins present at extremely low levels which were consequently missed by our global analysis. In this case we have used a 'targeted' approach to quantify exactly how much of our chosen proteins are present at each stage of the response. This experiment is currently underway and we expect to have the data in hand for analysis in the next week or two.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>-Our new immunisation protocol will allow researchers studying fish immune responses as well as those developing new vaccines to use fewer fish for their studies (aiding compliance with the 3Rs).
-As well as improving our knowledge regarding proteins previously shown to be involved in fish immune protection we have uncovered a number of new targets which also appear be playing a role, and that certainly should be investigated further.
-We have shown the utility of global proteomic analysis in understanding fish immune responses and are on our way to completing the same for targeted proteomic approaches. 
-Once validation is complete we anticipate the platform we have developed can be used by scientists in the aquaculture sector to gain a more accurate and complete understanding of the immune response when testing new vaccines, adjuvants or modes of administration. This, in turn, should shorten the time it takes for new and improved vaccines to come to market, while dramatically reducing the number of animals required relative to current protocols.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D7E0136D-64BA-4558-84FD-8253B335EA0C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56bdd6d4cadce2.68774396</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/M026345/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>48D25546-6ADF-479A-8877-478CCDB1DC1F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Animal Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>17F21DBC-4946-4262-AD07-9914F6EA12F7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Bioengineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E2AC43A0-F15F-4F00-8557-FB2D01D65940</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Immunology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>11093A5C-4232-4625-96BA-FC7E5BA96CE2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Protein engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
