Bees</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/M009319/2</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>'Telling the Bees' is a collaboration with Tay Landscape Partnership (TayLP) and beekeeping groups in the Perth and Tayside area to conduct research into beekeeping knowledge and the many ways it is created, stored and transmitted.

Beekeeping is currently experiencing a surge of popularity, coinciding with a rise of localism and a consumer drive for homemade produce. Bees have also become popular subjects of non-fiction prose, literature, poetry and art, in part because their plight has become emblematic of contemporary environmental crises. Whilst a new generation of beekeepers is emerging, the methods by which they learn their skills is changing. As a highly mythologised practice, incorporating elements of folklore, literature and long-standing oral traditions, beekeeping can historically be regarded as a form of Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK). However, now that short courses and beekeeping manuals are commonplace, there is a question as to what extent traditional elements remain. Is the modernisation of beekeeping resulting in the loss of traditionally held knowledge, understanding and practice? Our research considers this question and offers a bridge between different practices: working with beekeepers, writers, artists and designers, we will co-create new experimental forms of beekeeping knowledge (such as 3D printed artworks, creative writing and interactive films, to name just a few possibilities) by recodifying and repackaging beekeeping knowledge into 'future folklore'.

TayLP, a public and third sector partnership in receipt of a &amp;pound;1.43 million Heritage Lottery Fund grant, has a remit to work with communities in the Perth and Tayside to &amp;quot;reconnect residents and visitors with the natural, built and cultural heritage of the area&amp;quot;. This includes a bee colony regeneration project, with aims that include training 20 new beekeepers and producing 10 events in local schools between 2014-2018. 'Telling the Bees' will augment and expand these activities. Afer an initial review of beekeeping knowledge and practice, including an analysis of the Moir Rare Book Collection of beekeeping books at Fountainbridge public library, Edinburgh and participation on beekeeping training courses, the project team will run a series of workshops with TayLP, schools and local community groups to collaboratively develop new creative research models (future folklore) that generate a shared understanding among beekeeping and non-beekeeping community members of the significance of beekeeping for local landscape management, cultural heritage, and environmental sustainability. The project will also play a key role at TayLP's annual Heritage Festival in Carse of Gowrie, where it will showcase its research and gauge public reaction to the 'future folklore' prototypes.

In addition to its presence at the TayLP's Heritage Festival, 'Telling the Bees' will raise awareness of its research via a public facing website and social media profiles. Its creative outputs, the 'future folklore', have the potential to reach and connect with new audiences beyond those directly engaging with the project activities, and long after the project has been completed. A one day symposium held at the end of the project will reflect on the concept of 'future folklore' and help disseminate the research findings.

'Telling the Bees' contributes to the Connected Communities programme by making community groups an integral part of innovative research, engaging them in an exciting and stimulating series of events and workshops. They will help co-produce outputs that cross disciplinary boundaries in the arts and humanities, and which form a timely investigation into TEK, cultural heritage and environmental management.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Direct beneficiaries include:
- Volunteers and Staff at the Tay Landscape Partnership (TayLP) - an HLF funded partnership of third sector and public sector organisations including Perth &amp;amp; Kinross Heritage Trust, Perth &amp;amp; Kinross Countryside Trust, Gannochy Trust and Perth &amp;amp; Kinross Council
- Existing beekeeping charities such as East of Scotland and Perth District Beekeepers Associations
- New beekeepers involved in the TayLP training programme
- Wider public attending the TayLP Festival
- Beekeeping inmates at HMP Open Estate Castle Huntly
- Schools in Perth area
Indirect beneficiaries who can potentially use the research include beekeeping associations in Cornwall and the UK and other Landscape Partnerships in the UK, as well as the storytelling community in Scotland, including groups such as 'Blether Tay-Gither' (Dundee), and Bagatelle (Lothian).

The research has the potential to benefit third and public sector partnerships, existing communities of interest, and the wider public in the local Perth area. We envisage 4 areas of impact.
Impact 1: the research will benefit TayLP by increasing their effectiveness as a third and public sector partnership in delivering one of their key objectives: &amp;quot;to reconnect residents&amp;quot; with the &amp;quot;natural&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;cultural heritage of the area&amp;quot;. The research will enhance capacity among staff and volunteers to engage with the local community through the use of creative research practice and future folklore. This will be achieved through involving staff and volunteers in oral histories and education outreach, codesign workshops, coproducing and providing documentation for their annual Heritage Festival, providing legacy materials for use by staff and volunteers. The impact will be measured through feedback from TayLP staff and volunteers throughout the project, and from measuring the level of community engagement with project outputs at the Festival. It is anticipated that this increase in effectiveness will also be realised beyond the 12-month life of the project, as the TayLP partnership work continues until 2018.

Impact 2: the research will benefit the local community, by developing public awareness and enabling a deeper shared understanding among beekeeping and non-beekeeping community members of the significance of beekeeping for local landscape management and environmental sustainability. This will be measured by evaluation of: public responses to the codesigned outputs at the festival; the experience of those involved in the project such as trainee beekeepers, volunteers, school children, or prison inmates. Methods such as questionnaires, personal meaning mapping, brief interviews, will seek to capture changes in understanding, attitudes, and any intended future behaviour of participants and the wider public.

Impact 3 - charitable beekeeping associations directly involved in the project will gain knowledge and experience of working with academic researchers to communicate their work and beekeeping knowledge to future potential beekeepers (including children and young people) and the wider community in new, sustainable, and exciting creative ways. Beyond the 12-month life of the project, the festival documentation, creative outputs, website, experience gained, and other academic outputs will potentially benefit beekeeping associations outside the Perth area, such as Cornwall and the rest of the UK. The symposium also offers a collaborative forum for the dissemination of shared knowledge.

Impact 4 - the research will provide cultural enrichment for individuals and communities participating in the project, through the codesign workshops, outputs at the TayLP festival, volunteer involvement in oral history recording and/or contributing to the website content, and any work undertaken with inmates at Huntly or in schools. Evidence of cultural enrichment will be captured using simple questionnaires and/or personal meaning maps at the end of events.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>8822</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The Beespoon was one of the 'Future Folklore' artefacts produced by designer Liz Edwards, and emerging from our three co-design workshops.

The Beespoon is a small copper spoon that can carry the amount of honey a single honey bee produces in her lifetime (approximately 1/12th of a teaspoon). When the whole exhibit is installed, the Beespoon is placed on a plinth which dispenses honey onto the spoon as a reward for making origami paper flowers. This simulates the work carried out by the bee as it visits c.1800 flowers in the process of making one Beespoon's worth of honey.</gtr:description><gtr:id>1556A350-BE94-4908-8E96-7BF5EE8FEC84</gtr:id><gtr:impact>To date, the Beespoon installation has been set up at a project partner Fruit Festival, where we were surprised by the quality of the engagement from those who visited the installation (over 100 people attended the festival). We had anticipated that general public visitors might only stay a short a time and make the quickest, easiest origami flower possible in order to interact with the Beespoon, but children were captivated by the complicated designs and often chose them, even though they took much longer to make. Many children were in the tent for more than fifteen minutes with some staying over 30mins, or making return visits over the course of the day's installation. The Beespoon always provoked a response, often astonishment, generally followed by contemplating the number of bee lives that produced the honey on a piece of toast. Some commented that it made them feel bad about how much honey they used, whilst others marvelled at the preciousness of honey. 

We have several confirmed plans to install the beespoon at future events, both academic and general public, where we will capture data on the value of the Beespoon as a research through design artefact and the impact it has on people's understanding of industriousness, environmental issues and consumption.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56db0462596321.56983041</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Beespoon</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artefact (including digital)</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.bees.eca.ed.ac.uk/2016/02/how-much-honey-does-a-beespoon-hold</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A series of 18 stories and accompanying illustrations were produced by over 50 pupils at 3 primary schools (across classes ranging from P3-P7) in the Tayside area.

It encourages the wearer to think about the communication of knowledge - knowledge accumulated by beekeepers and relayed through the speakers, and knowledge accumulated and communicated by bees as they forage for food.

Three Beekeepers' Suits were modified by sewing speakers and an iPhone into the hats. The mobile phones were programmed to play short audio files (recorded during a series of interviews with beekeepers) when the wearers came within 5m of a series of bluetooth beacons. Meanwhile, the wearers' movements were tracked using the phones' GPS functions, mimicking scientific experiments that have recorded bee foraging patterns.</gtr:description><gtr:id>F94EAB86-39C2-4458-BF6E-D3B0E1E01557</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Augmented Bee Suit was trialled at Perth Fruit Festival, where it was actively tested by approx. 20 adults and children throughout the day. The bee suits were displayed on a hat stand in a project tent at the festival, so that even when not actively in use, they provoked questions about their presence, design and implementation. Adults were interested in and learned from the short audio clips, which discussed challenges facing bees and beekeepers. Children enjoyed the 'treasure hunt' aspect of the experience but were generally uninterested in the audio. The trial inspired the project team to think about new ways to adapt the suit for researching the communication of environmental knowledge (e.g as part of games and more explicitly staged experiments), to be taken forward as part of future funding bids.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56db0c3e17c9f3.75843595</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Augmented Bee Suit</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artefact (including digital)</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Maxwell, Edwards, Pillatt and Downing produced a short piece of creative writing 'Mr Shore's Downfall' intended to act as an example 'speculative design'. 

We imagined a dystopian future world where bees had become a precious commodity. This world was populated by a series of 'design fiction artefacts' that were used in beekeeping activities. By thinking about this future world and its artefacts, we are forced to critically examine our contemporary world and the environmental challenges we face.</gtr:description><gtr:id>309A97DF-8AE1-4B40-AADA-18AF40D3BFE6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Our fiction was published at the prestigious ACM NordiCHI design conference in Gothenburg, October 2016.

The boxes were designed to hang in trees, mimicking the way hives naturally form along branches and in hollows. Each school had its own shape of hive/box, and each was decorated with dyed beeswax 'plugs' which covered hexagon shaped cells. Each group of school children also designed their own hexagon shaped lids for the cells that accommodated their particularly stories. The result was group of exceptionally attractive and colourful boxes that could placed around any outdoor site.</gtr:description><gtr:id>21F42EFE-8369-48E8-8899-9A8FF1A55C14</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The bee boxes were installed at Perth Fruit Festival, situated in a public park, and served to act as a visual and physical trail round the site, encouraging casual passers by to engage with the boxes and subsequently the festival activities themselves. The largest impact however was that of the schools themselves. Each of the 3 primary schools involved in the story box creation have an orchard, and schools actively requested the story boxes so that they could install them in their schools. As 'Future Folklore' artefacts, the story boxes were a means of encapsulating children's stories and making them more durable, and thereby increasing their longevity. As such, the boxes served as a visual and tangible memory of the Telling the Bees engagement, research and learning, which was reinforced when the project team returned to the schools to show students their completed boxes.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56db0f67c156c8.70764836</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Storycomb Boxes</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artefact (including digital)</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.bees.eca.ed.ac.uk/2015/11/the-story-comb-boxes/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A series of seed packets containing Scottish wildflower seeds complete with printed bee folklore and quotes (or 'beelore') on the front, and a URL to the project website.</gtr:description><gtr:id>230A58B0-08FF-495F-AAD3-31FB359AD00E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>300 printed seed packets were made up and distributed to members of the public at project public engagement events.

We are developing interpretation to support connection to nature in general and the garden in particular.

I have worked with gardeners and volunteers to learn about the values and cultural history of the walled kitchen garden and its 'spirit of place'. I have collaborated to create designs to interpret different aspects of the garden including the National Collection of Rhubarb and the Regional Apple Collection. These designs include the Rhubaphone, Audio Apples and Garden Shed Roadshow detailed in the Artistic and Creative Products section. I have made prototype designs for interpretation in a children's garden, initiated and designed by a gardener. This work is ongoing. Through the collaboration we have implemented a new strand of volunteering in the Walled Kitchen Garden, focussing on digital, and other interpretation in the Walled Kitchen Garden. I am supporting the new volunteer, through training in relation to maintenance of existing artefacts and support in creation of new interpretation designs. 

I have successfully applied for additional funding to extend the working relationship beyond my PhD.

I have brought the artefacts from Telling the Bees (Beespoon installation and Physical story comb boxes (Bee boxes) to events at Clumber Park (Rhubarb Weekend and Apple weekend) and this has led to planning towards extending the interpretation offering about bees in the Walled Kitchen Garden at Clumber Park.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Falmouth University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>English Dept, Falmouth University</gtr:description><gtr:id>BB154A21-DD02-4E62-BBE8-9E3C824D902E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Outputs from the collaboration and specific poetry activity led to a set of poems and illustrations completed and displayed by members of the public at a fruit festival.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e0660651d778.67464817-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Two students on creative writing and journalism undergraduate course at Falmouth University worked with project co-investigator, Dr Niamh Downing, to design and run a poetry and illustration activity at a key engagement event, the TayLP Fruit Festival.

Held in a spiegeltent erected outside Sheffield City Hall in the heart of the city, the event was an integral part of the University of Sheffield's Festival of the Mind, celebrating its research and engagement with local communities, and reaching over 50,000 people.

At the Telling the Bees Performance-Lecture, around 150 audience members, including a large number of children, were treated to an interactive learning experience that consisted of:
Elements of a traditional lecture led by Pillatt
Drama performances led by young people and professional actors
Origami flower making at our Beespoon installation 
Candle-rolling and an observation hive provided by Sheffield Beekeepers' Association

Visitor feedback was collected via postcards, iPad surveys, visitor books and audience surveys. The feedback for the festival as a whole was overwhelmingly positive, as were the comments for the Telling the Bees:

&amp;quot;Brilliant on every level.&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;It does not talk down to its audience.&amp;quot;

Over 100 people attended the event overall, most of which visited the project tents. The hands-on activities provided a space for prolonged engagement and conversation, in particular around the personal values and stories of bees and the environment, with many attendees expressing surprise at the amount of work that goes into the production of honey by the honey bee.

The Beespoon activity was a modified version of the activity used at other events. The activity began with a Q&amp;amp;A discussion about bees and involved sensory engagement activities like smelling beeswax and trying on a beekeeper's suit. Children were given laser cut flowers on which to write down facts they had learned through the morning to be placed on the flower display. Then they made origami flowers to add to the display. For every flower made they pressed the button on the beespoon installation to triggered the pump and drop honey into the beespoon The time spent making created a space for conversation about bees and for knowledge sharing and dissemination.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c987bd6d47d7.73679577</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Article for TayLP Newsletter</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D680AF55-C997-40E3-955D-EE1EFC724E13</gtr:id><gtr:impact>An article was produced for the Tay Landscape Partnership newsletter, describing the aims of the project and encouraging local people to get involved.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dc51359aba36.83690831</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Clumber Rhubarb Weekend</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A0F304EA-0745-4C67-961C-5A50BEC9F660</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Maxwell and Edwards took the Beespoon installation to Clumber Park's Rhubarb Weekend, which had approximately 1000 visitors.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c7ff423e6599.92969967</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Ecclesall Woods Spring Festival</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6E57EB51-7D6E-48B6-8C9B-8D4452D6990B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Maxwell, Pillatt and Edwards attended the Ecclesall Woods Spring Festival in Sheffield with the Beespoon exhibit.

For instance, in our first codesign workshop, storytellers and beekeepers worked together to generate short stories, which were recounted back to the group. Subsequently, one professional storyteller worked up and retold one of the co-created bee stories in her practice. Similarly, in the third and final codesign workshop, an early presentation of a physical beespoon (a small spoon 1/12 the size of a teaspoon) fascinated beekeepers. One beekeeper compared the diameter of a syringe used in an early prototype to the capacity of a bee's stomach to compare the amount of nectar gathered, whilst several beekeepers and non-beekeepers expressed a desire for their own Beespoons and two even asked for details of the jeweller who made the original in order to commission their own. One workshop participant talked about the Beespoon as a potential commercial product: a Christening present or gift to mark special occasions. A beekeeper who runs educational activities in schools has subsequently begun to weave the story of the Beespoon into their practice. Our schools workshops, involving a beekeeper who brought an observation hive into the classrooms, and followed up by pupils writing their own stories, tied directly into the Scottish curriculum for excellence, and helped our Heritage Lottery Funded (HLF) project community partner, TayLP, deliver on their educational Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). 

We have taken the Beespoon installation to a wide variety of public engagement events, comprising fruit, insect and woodland festivals (see outputs). Our origami flower making activity has proven incredibly popular at these events, and children often marvel at the amount of work a single honey bee does to produce her one beespoon of honey. We have also found that the gentle but focused process of making the paper flowers provides an excellent forum for discussing environmental issues and the sharing of personal stories (e.g. the father who recalled being made to help out with his father's hives as a punishment for being naughty as a child). Our Follow-on Funding project Hacking the Bees builds on this experience, and links 'making as a way of thinking' to our research interest in future-focused speculative design and design fictions.

After receiving additional funding from the University of Sheffield to host a 'Performance- Lecture' as part of their city-wide Festival of the Mind, we formed new collaborations with Growtheatre youth theatre company and Sheffield Beekeepers' Association. In preparation for the event, Growtheatre used elements of the Telling the Bees research - oral histories, archival research and the Beespoon - as inspiration for creating bee-themed drama, developed and performed by young people. As well as garnering excellent feedback from the audience (see outputs), the project engaged members of the youth theatre group in exploring the world of bees and associated environmental issues. Such was their immersion in this activity, parents remarked that their children were frequently articulating bee-related facts well away from the workshops. As partner, Growtheatre have also found bees to be a useful educational and narrative device that supports their other commercial activities. For example, their bid to be part of Sheffield Libraries' programme of National Reading Week 2017 events includes workshops themed around bees.

A key outcome from the original project was a successful bid for Follow-on Funding for Impact and Engagement. As a result, the new project Hacking the Bees will continue securing impacts and legacies from the Telling the Bees research. In short, the project will team up with Explore York and Growtheatre to redesign the Beespoon installation, use making, storytelling and drama to get pupils at Sheffield primary schools thinking imaginatively about the future of beekeeping, and host a series events in York, including as part of a week of bee-themed activities in October 2017. Ultimately, Hacking the Bees will build on the work of Telling the Bees in seeking to harness the power of making and imagination as a way to foster lifelong learning, and to provoke new conversations on the significance of the honey bee to our environment and society.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>476F2150-5352-4949-875A-8361A1EFED47</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>58c829a3c125b0.82984492</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Environment,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The most significant achievements from the award are a set of Future Folklore prototypes that emerged from codesign process (see creative products).

The award aims and objectives have all been broadly met as detailed below. 
1. Our objective to &amp;quot;better understand how information and knowledge is produced and passed on through the beekeeping community today&amp;quot; was achieved through intense participatory observation of Scottish beekeeping communities. This included conducting a series of 12 in-depth interviews with beekeepers across Scotland, participatory observation at apiary inspections, attending local beekeeping association talks, and volunteer stewarding at the Scottish Beekeeping Association Honey Tent at the Royal Highland Show. This led to a rich data set of observations, field notes and interview transcripts, which will be written up for publication. This is paralleled by a literature review of contemporary and archival documentation of beekeeping practices, including those at the Moir Library rare books collection (National Library Scotland).

2. Our aim to &amp;quot;experiment with creative ways to codify and repackage examples of this beekeeping knowledge as future folklore prototypes&amp;quot; was fully realised through our research through design (RtD) practice adopted by working with beekeepers and storytellers in a series of three interactive, participatory workshop events. Each workshop was carefully crafted to open up dialogue, celebrate and value different knowledge and skill sets and to progress through divergent and convergent thinking processes. To this end each workshop had its own output, namely, 1) a series of stories; 2) a set of early stage conceptual ideas and technologies; and 3) refined prototypes. Each workshop reflected on the nature of beekeeping practices and narrative.

3. Our aim to &amp;quot;develop capacity within TayLP through partnership working that will enhance their delivery of a subset of their local community programme (2014-2018) that includes training new beekeepers&amp;quot; was predominantly realised through the relationships and informal partnerships the project team established with the Scottish beekeeping communities. The project offered a new way to connect and engage with beekeepers, a reciprocal relationship of knowledge exchange between academia, storytelling, and beekeeping. This led to a virtuous circle of support between the local beekeepers and community partner TayLP, supported and fostered by the project activities.
 
4. Our aim and objective to begin reflecting on the value and relevance of the future folklore concept, as instantiated through the prototypes, is partially realised. The concept of future folklore was specifically explored and problematised in our Large Honey Collider event in Edinburgh, where participants reflected on stories and making as vehicles for creating living knowledge. They also raised questions, however, concerning the validity of the term 'future folklore', and whether folklore can be designed. Much of our work has focused on how future folklore can be situated with the design domain, framed as a counterpoint to critical design and design fictions (see publications). In addition, we undertook a somewhat playful reorientation of the concept to address the growing field of critical design and design fictions. Our co-written fiction 'Mr Shore's Downfall' was well received at the prestigious ACM NordiCHI conference in Gothenburg. Combining the myths and folklore of beekeeping with an understanding of contemporary practice and warnings for the future, this kind of future-focused design and story-making also formed a key component of our successful Follow-on Funding application.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The direct Artistic and Creative project outputs have been in almost continuous use. Physical story comb boxes were gifted to the three rural primary schools involved in their creation. The Beespoon installation has been used in numerous public engagement events, as a creative research output, as well as a data gathering and dialogical tool. After securing further funding in collaboration with a youth theatre group, some of the research data (anonymised interview transcripts, gathered archival material, and bee stories created by school groups) was repurposed to create a performative theatre piece (see outputs). The theatre group now includes bee-related activities in its bids for work from other customers. In academic contexts, the design community and environmental humanities are primary audiences for the research findings.
