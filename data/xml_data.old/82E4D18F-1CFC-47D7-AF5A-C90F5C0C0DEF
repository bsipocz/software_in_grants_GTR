Major UK airports are under increasing pressure to add extra new runways. The impact of aircraft noise on the local environment is profound especially in the surrounding areas of an airport. In the worst case noise can be more than just annoying, potentially being a contributory factor towards illnesses such as hypertension. In the latest FlightPath 2050 noise emission targets, set by the Advisory Council for Aviation Research and innovation in Europe (ACARE), the perceived noise emission of flying aircraft is to be reduced by 65% relative to levels of 2000 by 2050. This is a huge ambition and tremendous challenge to the aerospace industry, potentially putting noise research to the forefront. Continuing reductions in permitted take-off noise levels are also making the existing technology and more established plane/engine models obsolete giving the strong economic implications for the proposed work.

Large Eddy Simulation (LES) based numerical prediction of jet noise has become increasingly promising in both research communities and industry. Despite LES prediction being generally more affordable compared to acoustic experiments, it is still time consuming and costly, often requiring significant High Performance Computing (HPC) resources, in order to capture both low- and high-frequency noise spectra. This is known as the scale disparity, and clearly is preventing LES based noise predictive methods from being further applied to more complex and realistic industrial jet configurations. To circumvent this obstacle of scale disparity, the work proposed aims to explore the potential advantages of a novel approach of combining noise spectra (in the spectral space) obtained from LES solutions with different grid resolutions in the physical space. The current work extends the methodology developed in the recently completed and highly successful EPSRC project GR/T06629/01, in which the applicant being the lead researcher, and the ongoing Rolls-Royce/TSB funded SILOET programme jet noise project. Results obtained from this work will be benchmarked against NASA experimental data as well as results from a full length sampling fine-grid single LES solution. The work will also investigate turbulent energy flux directed from smaller eddies to larger ones by a low-pass filtering analysis of the resolved flow field, the evaluation of velocity structure function and turbulent kinetic energy spectra.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>With the project's nature being industrially inspired, the potential benefits and impacts to society are high. Air transport growth is at a fast pace, almost doubling every two decades. This is evidenced by the fact that major UK airports are under the pressure to add extra new runways. It is becoming urgent to take steps to reduce the environmental impact with respect to noise emissions giving strong strategic importance to the current work's context. In the meantime, continual reductions in permitted take-off noise levels make existing technologies and established plane/engine models no longer commercially viable giving strong economic implications of the current work.

We expect the current work will have strong technological impacts in the aerospace industry, especially for Rolls-Royce plc. With Rolls-Royce being a project partner and the applicant being a member of the Rolls-Royce University Technology Centre (UTC), strong engagement with Rolls-Royce plc is expected from the start. This will naturally take place through regular interactions between the project team at the UTC and Rolls-Royce engineers. The methods developed in the proposed work will help ensure that the latest regulatory noise emissions targets can be met, and the potential to manufacture quieter and more efficient engines offers tremendous competitive business advantages. This will have the subsequent impact on creating greater national wealth and securing employment in manufacturing, hence the UK economy.

With regards to people and skills, the project will help produce two highly trained aerodynamicists (CFD experts), who will benefit from regular supervision and technical advice from the investigator as well as their own interactions with Rolls-Royce engineers. This training is valuable to the UK science/technology base, and there is a well-established recruitment route leading such researchers to Rolls-Royce and other key UK aerospace companies. The new efficient computational and mathematical modelling technology will offer the potential for substantially reduced design and wind tunnel/acoustic test costs. The project aims for disseminating the developed computational procedures to Rolls-Royce plc as well as the wider research and development community.

In summary, the proposed work has great environmental importance to the society. It has commercial importance to the UK economy, potentially securing UK jobs in a high technology area and also producing highly trained skills. This is because greater physical understanding, better mathematical models, and novel methods for acoustic prediction will be created. The spectral relay technique based on LES and acoustic analogy devised during the project along with the physical insights on turbulence energy flux should thus all have substantial scientific impacts. The work also has wide potential application beyond jet acoustics since a generic predictive approach will be developed as well as insights into turbulence physics.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>97728</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Rolls Royce Group Plc</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Noise Department</gtr:department><gtr:description>Partnership with Rolls-Royce (EPSRC jet noise project)</gtr:description><gtr:id>85DBF1A6-36A9-4D3C-8BEA-2CB6B7087B4F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>1 x RR-UTC technical report, September 2015, pp39-42.

Rolls-Royce are currently monitoring a number of jet noise research projects at different research groups/consortia including works on complex installed configurations and hot jet. From their perspective, the current proposal from Loughborough will add a new aspect to our jet noise research portfolio, strengthening Rolls-Royce's support and commitment to the Rolls-Royce UTC at Loughborough. Rolls-Royce bring to the partnership considerable jet noise experience and will work closely with the researchers with regard to understanding and interpreting the QinetiQ NTF data. Rolls-Royce will encourage close interaction between Loughborough and other groups to promote the timely development and most up-to-date prediction and design tools for installed nozzle geometries. Over the next decade significant changes to engine geometry for commercial aircraft applications are anticipated, and studies on developing novel prediction/design methods potentially bringing step changes to the company's capabilities are important. As the project partner, Rolls-Royce actively engage with the project team and monitor the project progress. This includes allocating staff time for regular progress meetings. Staff efforts for arranging measurement data transfer will also be made. These are in addition to the usual routes of interaction such as the annual noise and CFD review meetings and various UTC review meetings.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>This project is aimed at a key challenge of large-eddy simulation based jet noise prediction methods. The underpinning modelling approach was developed previously with support from a number of EPSRC funded projects, which Rolls-Royce closely monitored with interest and were impressed by its success. The proposed novel concept of Spectral Relay in the current project in theory could significantly amplify the prediction capability of capturing significantly wider frequency ranges of noise spectra with the same computing resources. In this project, we are also investigating the influence of the turbulent energy flux on noise source in the initial regions of the jet shear layer, hence, provide the practical approach with theoretical background and credibility. It is envisaged the spectral relay approach developed in this project is applicable to generic jet noise problems, which are highly relevant to Rolls-Royce. The new methodology itself as the focus of this project is potentially able to be used in their design process in the near future. Via regular meetings, the research team at Loughborough University update our partner with the latest project progress. We share our results and important technical details which are crucial to obtain improved predictions. We also give our opinions and analyses on some of the more practical issues that are encountered in their modelling and design processes.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited Talk - Euromech Colloquium 571 / IUTAM Symposium - Sept 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9FC7BC7B-0363-44A1-85E7-7FF5BC05DE62</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This is an invited speech at the conference organised as a joint event under the partnership of Euromech and IUTAM.

The project was directly aimed to address the scale disparity challenge of modelling jet turbulence and its associated mechanism for noise generation, and our results show that it is possible to achieve up to 90% of High Performance Computing (HPC) time savings by applying the new concept. This means we can predict significantly wider noise spectra (i.e. with both higher and lower Strouhal number) than conventional eddy-resolving approaches using the same amount of HPC resources. This can be practically attractive to aero-engine and aero-frame manufacturers who are steadily edging towards more computer aided predictive methods for future quieter designs.

The test cases were selected from publicly available NASA databases with extensive experimental data. With the use of a newly implemented subgrid-scale stress model and the use of hierarchy grids, we are able to achieve consistent comparison with the measurements across all levels of grid resolution tested. The project was completed recently and its findings are yet to be fully reported in our journal publication.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We have explored potential advantages of a novel concept of &amp;quot;Spectral Relay&amp;quot; for predicting the far-field noise of turbulent high speed jets.
