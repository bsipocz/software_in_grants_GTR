Design</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/N005945/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This project explores novel, intelligent models of design engineering processes that utilise real-time sensor based information and Ubiquitous Computing (ubicomp) technologies to promote stakeholder collaboration, and embed life cycle knowledge throughout sustainable engineering design processes. With this initial step our vision is to explore the future possibilities for harnessing emerging technologies through this research, to empower designers to be more responsive to changing environmental, economic and social demands, and ultimately develop more 'meaningful' products. This multi-disciplinary project will therefore bring together researchers in sustainable design engineering and interactive technologies, to propose new Ubicomp Enabled Design (UED) process archetypes and design tools, which will encourage holistic development of intelligent, sustainable patterns of production and consumption. 

Design is a key enabler for innovation and sustainability, and has been widely shown to not only improve creativity, revenue, and competitiveness but also to strategically boosting the skills and knowledge of a company. Engineering design processes however are becoming increasingly complex, as designers have to juggle consideration of a rising number of factors throughout design, such as technical factors (e.g. incorporating new materials and technologies), economic factors (e.g. driving down product costs) environmental factors (e.g. reducing resource demand) and social factors (e.g. increasing usability and customisation). It is therefore critical to help support designers to make smarter and more informed decisions, and as such, a large amount of research effort has been directed at developing methods to support engineering. This has included frameworks for knowledge management, novel computer aided design approaches, and a wide variety of dedicated design tools and methods. In this context, this research proposes that recent socio-technological advances (driven by emerging areas such as big data and internet of things), present a unique and unprecedented opportunity to help support design engineering - to find new ways to help get the right information, in front of the right people, at the right time.

This research therefore seeks to understand how ubicomp technologies can be harnessed within the design process to enable more informed, more responsive, and more effective engineering design. The principle outcomes of this crosscutting feasibility project will be a series of holistic reference models for UED processes, and the definition of a future programme of research in this area towards incorporating socio-technological advances into engineering design.

To achieve this, the project will bring together expertise in sustainable design engineering from Loughborough University and in interactive technologies from the University of Nottingham. The design process models developed in this research will be showcased and demonstrated through a series of 'design and manufacturing futures' - or scenarios that will illustrate possible futures for different consumer products in three sectors of Personal Care, Drug Delivery, and Internet-of-Things Enabled Devices. These scenarios will be supported by technology demonstrators (prototype cloud enabled products), and design toolkits (conceptual engineering decision support tools) that will be developed to show how UED processes could be applied in practice. These scenarios will target to demonstrate the potential of UED in these diverse and prominent sectors of UK manufacturing - from both the business and consumer point of view.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project has the potential for global, cross-sectorial impact on the way that companies manage their design processes, engage with their customers, and respond to the incorporation of new knowledge within their activities. The Ubicomp Enabled Design (UED) processes, methods and tools developed in this research could therefore be a key disruptive enabler for moving towards businesses that are more sustainable, more responsive and closer to customers; opening up new market and product opportunities.

In the immediate future, this research will primarily help the project partners involved in contributing to the Advisory Group and developing the case studies. Through direct involvement they will be able to not only steer the work, but will gain an insight into the opportunities for the future of more responsive UED processes. In addition they will have access to simple methods to improve their own design processes and gain an improved understanding of their customers. Finally, they will also have the prospect to become involved in proposal development for future research and enterprise projects.
In addition to identifying the potential for new cloud enabled products and UED tools, this project will as a result identify ways to quickly promote skills development of designers, as well as business competitiveness in the face of increasing uncertainty. The outputs will therefore also help a wider network of companies in a similar way, and to this end we will engage a broad network of key industrial stakeholders, SMEs and start-ups through dissemination activities such as the website and futures event.

Many companies however only undertake 'sustainable' design improvement activities such as these, because either legislation requires them to, or the customer demands it. Therefore it is important to also disseminate the project findings to policy makers and the general public (consumers).
To this end, the findings of this project will be particularly interesting to organisations such as the Design Council, the All-Party Parliamentary Design and Innovation Group, and the Behavioural Insights Team, who advocate that design improvements will be key in realising more effective design of future products and services, and that this will be central to the future competitiveness and sustainability of the UK economy. This project therefore directly addresses their recommendations by being a key enabler of co-design methods and new holistic business models for improving systems of production and consumption, as well as consumer behaviours.

With respect to the general public, it is becoming clear that relationships between consumers and companies are changing. Through socio-technological advances and the proliferation of social media, the role of marketing has seen a dramatic shift towards customer engagement and relationship building (in contrast to more traditional 'push' marketing designed to promote make-sell business models). This in turn has created a more informed customer base that increasingly desire tailored products and services to meet their needs. Engineering design processes will therefore need to develop and change to support this increasing customer focus within future business models. This project seeks to harness these socio-technological advances, to equip design engineers with the information they need to conduct user inspired design, and promote pragmatic and informed decision making. To this end, a series of future design scenarios will be developed that will showcase the potential for UED, using case studies of simple everyday products. Through this it is hoped to raise awareness and empower consumers to make more informed decisions, and in particular to illustrate that they have some control over selecting more responsible companies and products. In the long term, the tools developed in this research will also help consumers to receive products and solutions that address and respond to their needs.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>295395</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Victoria and Albert Museum</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Victoria &amp;amp; Albert Museum</gtr:description><gtr:id>487826DC-EAAB-4FDC-A8FF-B67C7BB8F7E0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This collaboration is multi-disciplinary and spans material studies, futuricity, scenario planning, and design.

The summer school was highly regarded and has resulted in a permanent relationship with the university outreach department and a recurring course next summer, as well as a number of students applying to study design engineering a degree level.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c8212f316b25.92032969</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Global Innovation Design Workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7EDA98C3-099C-4900-AB42-5C8E2A5A0590</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was a 3 day workshop that began with 20 students attending an exhibition at the Victoria and Albert museum.

The initial activities however have already begun to show impact in a number of areas, primarily in the development of future design leaders:

-- 1. Students who have attended our 'Global Summer School' week long workshops have been introduced to new ways of thinking and working. Many attendees quoted that the experience helped them be aware of the challenges of the future, and feel more empowered to have a positive impact on them. A number of students have since applied to study design engineering at University and pursue these areas further.
-- 2. Designers engaged in the 'Future Tense' workshops run in partnership with Forum for the Future have been exposed to new methods and tools for thinking about the future in strategic and disruptive ways. Many attendees have stated that this has positively impacted their design practice as a result. 
--3. Postgraduate students in the UK and Chile have been engaged in research workshops and outreach activities, which have involved teaching them about scenario planning and futures methods, and developing new product solutions with a future vision. Many of these students have reported new approaches to design, and new outlooks on their future project work.
-- 4. Attendance at RECODE network events has resulted in PI participation in another feasibility study project exploring &amp;quot;Business as Unsual: Designing Products with Consumers in the Loop&amp;quot; which has been informed by, and in turn further informed, the work on this project. Learnings from this project helped build plausible potential futures for utilising data to inform the design process, and the results from the RECODE study can be used by companies to understand how customers can be engaged in the design of products within localised networks of manufacturing.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>8F06CC0D-A490-4654-8645-C50F39DC84C4</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>58c9d6249e5ec4.86607017</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This feasibility study will define and propose novel models of future design processes that can be informed and enhanced by ubiquitous computing. These will be presented at the end of the project through a series of conceptual scenarios that will illustrate how the design of products might occur in the future, and what new opportunities these smarter products, and smarter designers, might unlock.

Throughout these initial investigative stages of the project, we have identified the challenges and opportunities for Ubiquitous Computing Enabled Design (UED) and are in the process of developing conceptual products and scenarios that illustrate future applications of UED. To build these scenarios, we have developed and tested new methods of encouraging designers to strategically consider uncertain futures. We have critically also built a network of new partners interested in the progression of sustainable design practice, scenario planning, and data driven design - towards pushing beyond this feasibility study into a deeper investigation.

In summary, our key findings to date have been:
--1. There is large potential for harnessing ubiquitous computing enabled products to reduce environmental impacts in business-to-business contexts. In these cases, real time information about the use of the product can help inform the design of improved products, the maintenance of current products, and recommendations for improved usage behaviours. These feedback loops create a reciprocal relationship where each business receives a mutual benefit (through reduced costs and improved operation and insight), and a custom service system can be built to support it. 
--2. There has historically been limited effective uptake of ubiquitous computing enabled products to reduce environmental impacts in consumer goods. In most cases 'smart products' are those that give novelty with features enabled by new technology, but typically have a very high drop-off rate when users discard them quickly. This is evident in trends such as the quantified self, where activity trackers have been hugely popular, but many quickly sit unused. This highlights the importance of understanding how to build a relationship between the user and company in the context of design, as well as the importance of fun and novelty.
--3. Scenario planning methodologies can be augmented with objects and other design-led tools to become very effective methods of prompting designers to think about new opportunities for future products. Workshop results indicate that by employing a change in perspective, and requiring this to be applied to tangible solutions, designers are able to create a system level view of novel business models and products. This approach also enables designers to change their own practice and develop a values based approach to sustainable design.
--4. Through the research findings, and conversations with our network of industry representatives, academics, design thought leaders and futurists, 'Meaningful Design' has been defined as that which is sustainable, impactful, innovative, insightful, and delightful. Realising this therefore relies heavily on talking to users (to gain insight) to create something worth-while (with tangible impact) in the long term (in a sustainable manner).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>At this developmental stage of project progress, our interim findings might be taken forwards through a number of avenues of investigation and practice:
--1. Opportunities for UED: Through our review findings (soon to be published), businesses can understand opportunities for using data to build relationships with their customers, realise new service models, and improve their environmental performance.
--2. Novel Products and Services: Through our workshop findings (soon to be publicised), insights into new business models, and new products and services have been revealed. These highlight opportunities for creating new values based businesses, and technology enabled services.
--3. Education and Upskilling: Through our workshops we have developed new approaches to challenging the way designers think, and new tools for employing scenario planning methods. These will be made available for helping to shape new design tools, workshops and educational curricula.
--4. New Network and Projects: Through forming a new network of partners and collaborators, we are working on proposals for new projects that will continue this work, to help businesses build strategic approaches to design, and help future designers become skilled at interpreting and employing data to develop more meaningful products.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>60C2624A-26F2-4841-82AE-08C0277C6068</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c94b98079d52.48418491</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Environment,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Educational Workshops and Updates to Curricula</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5EC56EA8-94DE-4B6D-A81B-4E3B04F99434</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The workshops conducted were very successfully received and demonstrated positive impacts on design practice of those attending by equipping them to think more practically and strategically about the future.
