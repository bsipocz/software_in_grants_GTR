Much is known about the benefits and costs of living in groups, as well as which group an animal chooses to join. However, we know very little about the way in which these groups form. Recently, scientific interest has grown in the way the behaviour of individual animals, and the interactions that take place between animals, influence the patterns we see at the group level. For example, although animals appear to coordinate their behaviour, they cannot have information on the positions and movement of all other individuals in the group. We now know that the way fish shoals or flocks of birds move together can be explained by looking at the behaviour of the individual members of the shoal or flock. The movement of the group is coordinated by individuals only paying attention to some of their near neighbours. When many animals are frightened, perhaps because they detect a predator, they tend to bunch together tightly. This has been called the 'Selfish Herd' because each animal tries to reduce its chance of being captured by the predator by moving in between other individuals, and the best place to be is in the middle (which is selfish because it pushes others to the edge, where they are more vulnerable). But how can animals achieve this? Several 'movement rules' have been suggested. For example, one rule suggests each animal should move towards its nearest neighbour, while other rules suggest that animals should take notice of many others, and how far away they are, before deciding in which direction to move. Modelling analysis of these rules suggests that more complicated rules are better at reducing an animal's risk of falling victim to a predator, but we do not know much about whether animals use, or are capable of using, such rules. In this project, I propose to investigate these movement rules. Firstly, I will carry out more modelling, to compare all the different rules proposed, and look at the timing of predation events and whether the rules that are best when predators attack late are also best when they attack early. I will make predictions such as the size of groups that form which can be tested by studying real animals. I will then study the behaviour of shoals of fish (marine sticklebacks), and match their behaviour to the predictions of the models. Marine sticklebacks are ideal for this sort of work, as they live in social groups in the wild, and also swim freely in open water without seeking protection from the walls of an aquarium. It is important for biologists to understand the rules that animals use, so that we can understand how animals aggregate, and how grouping behaviour might evolve. We can then make predictions which may be important in understanding and managing natural and domestic populations of animals.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>222364</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The award has allowed me to develop as an academic, leading to my securing a permanent academic position at the University of Hull, where I am able to continue my research and develop my teaching at undergraduate and postgraduate levels, thereby enhancing the education of the next generation of biologists.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2010</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>13B1B39C-6148-4D79-BAA0-C773FB04451B</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545b60e573e215.89734928</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Many animals live in social groups, such as shoals of fish, herds of zebra, and flocks of birds.

When many animals are frightened, perhaps because they detect a predator, they tend to bunch together tightly. This has been called the 'Selfish Herd' because each animal tries to reduce its chance of being captured by the predator by moving in between other individuals, and the best place to be is in the middle (which is selfish because it pushes others to the edge, where they are more vulnerable). But how can animals achieve this? Several 'movement rules' have been suggested. For example, one rule suggests each animal should move towards its nearest neighbour, while other rules suggest that animals should take notice of many others, and how far away they are, before deciding in which direction to move. In this project, we investigated these movement rules, comparing their effectiveness at protecting an individual from predation.



We found that complicated rules that take into account many others reduce risk best when the animals are in small groups that are quite compact, while simple rules perform best in large, spread-out groups. Simple rules are also more effective in allowing an animal to avoid predators when the predator attacks quickly after it has been detected by the prey, allowing little time for escape movements. However, if the predator is likely to attack the edge of a group, the complicated rules are the only ones that allow an individual to move from the edge of a group to the centre. Our research suggests that there is a place for both simple and complicated rules, but we do not know which, if any, of these rules animals use. It is important for biologists to understand the rules that animals use, so that we can understand how animals aggregate, and how grouping behaviour might evolve. We can then make predictions that may be important in understanding and managing natural and domestic populations of animals.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>I was invited to contribute an article to Planet Earth magazine, and together with my PhD students, put together a general display for a university-based science fair for local school children on the evolution of group-living in animals.
