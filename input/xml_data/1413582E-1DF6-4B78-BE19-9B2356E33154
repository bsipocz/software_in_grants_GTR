Science uses them to predict and analyse how greenhouse gases such carbon dioxide influence climate systems. For members of the general public, understanding of these specialist images can be difficult, as they require specific knowledge of the functioning of ecological systems, underpinning maths and the graphical conventions used to represent phenomena. This proposed research network brings together a dozen researchers in science and art and design from the British Antarctic Survey, Universities of Westminster, Cambridge and Melbourne, industry specialists and public art platforms to find ways of representing this climate data through the production of art and design works. Despite the importance of Climate Models as contemporary visual forms, very little research that combines artistic and scientific research has previously been attempted that seeks make this material more publicly accessible and understandable. \n\nThe network provides a unique opportunity to do this by running a series of hands-on practical workshops and seminars in which art and design artifacts will be produced and the theoretical and public implications of research discussed over a 12-month period. These events culminate in a public exhibition and discussion of produced art works. Through these activities the network aims to:\n\n- Bring art approaches into scientific research processes in order to enhance understanding of how art and design methods can help scientists produce more comprehensible images and animations of climate data. \n\n- Gain understanding of how scientific Climate Models can be used as art media to inform digital arts practices concerned with producing art and design projects exploring the changing environment.\n\n- Explore how Climate Models can function as expressive visual, narrative representations of environmental change beyond their original scientific purpose. \n\n- Develop methods for exhibiting this work in ways that enable public access to it.\n\n- Connect art and science, theory and practice to share expertise, and develop ideas and methods. \n\nAt completion a number of objectives will have been reached including: the construction and public exhibition of prototype artworks derived from climate data, the development of interdisciplinary methodologies that integrate scientific and art and design practices; academic papers detailing the methodological and theoretical insights produced by the network and a further substantial funding bid building on research leads. Lastly the network aggregates a substantial amount of multidisciplinary expertise that has the potential to act as an intellectual focus for further art-science collaborations in the field. \n\nResearch is expected to be of interest to a range of audiences including Art and Design scholars/practitioners, science, media, geography and other academics. Additionally research is expected to benefit public art institutions, science and outreach organizations interested in environmental change, curators and journalists working in the creative industries; members of the public interested in the arts and science and government and policy groups.\n\nTom Corby an artist from the University of Westminster and Nathan Cunningham, a data scientist from the British Antarctic Survey, manage the network, design workshop and seminar materials, and plan dissemination activities in conjunction with a part-time administrator. A steering group that includes Corby and Cunningham will meet during the course of the project to ensure the smooth running of the project and delivery of aims and objectives.\n\n\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>It is difficult to predict the precise form of impact, but the production of new ideas, methods and ways of representing environmental change are likely to produce varied cultural social and educational benefits for diverse sectors and research end-users. Suggestive project impacts and beneficiaries include:\n\n- Independent art and design practitioners that seek to develop practices that respond to environmental change through access to new methodological approaches, expanded visual languages and enhanced technical capacity in studio practice.\n- Raises awareness of environmental change for wider audiences through art production and exhibition. Leading to increased public understanding and participation in debates, knowledge and understanding of environmental issues, and enhanced life experience through access to cultural experience;\n- Production of new audiences for the arts using environmental change as a route leading to raised participation in and engagement with cultural experiences thus benefiting UK creative industries.\n- Raises awareness for public and private institutions (galleries, museums) of the importance of developing coherent responses to environmental change through this process and through access to, and participation in, the network's discussions.\n- Improving strategic understanding for government, policy makers (DCMS, DECC) and climate advocacy groups (LWEC, International Polar Year, Royal Society of the Arts) of the role of the visual arts as a powerful medium for communication and route to public engagement in the area.\n- Enhances understanding for government, public sector bodies and policy makers (DEFRA, Skillset) of the role of digital media as a platform through which increased public participation in debates around environmental change can occur. \n- Develops the knowledge and understanding of digital and multidisciplinary practices for all network members. Participants benefit through increased skill development in emerging technology (cognitive growth) that positively impact on their future career and employment opportunities. \n- Develops non-academic members of the network through change in understanding of how academic skills in analysis and critical reflection can contribute to wider debates around the representation of climate change.\n\nBoth the PI and Co/I have experience of managing knowledge transfer and impact activities that will underpin impact planning. To ensure outreach is maximised, regular meetings are scheduled throughout the project with core network members to identify and invite appropriate impact partners to participate. Many network members represent external organisations that already interface with other networks of potential research end-users that aids this process. A comprehensive mailing list will be drawn up to publicise the network to relevant individuals and organisations to ensure high visibility, encourage participation and publicise public events (exhibition/seminars). The project's Ning website also functions as a key component of this process. As a social network platform, it affords high-degrees of communication and participation, i.e. it is not simply a platform for project PR and the publishing of static materials. The Ning will contain a public forum where external participants can start their own topics and communicate with network members. The most engaged of these will be invited to participate in network events. Relevant Internet mailing lists and other online platforms have been identified and will publicise the Ning at project commencement alongside postal mail-outs.\n\nTimescales: suggested benefits are intrinsic and difficult to track. That being said, impacts will begin to emerge from August 09 onwards. Others of a more substantive nature may be realized if further research funding is achieved, and will accrue 4 or 5 years from the end of this n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>24446</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The Data Landscapes project led to a number of digital artworks cumulatively called The Southern Ocean Studies; a series of hand-rendered watercolours derived from the geo-data of climate science; 2 peer-reviewed papers, 1 book chapter and 5 conferences and symposia. I was also selected to participate in the AHRC symposium on climate change and the humanities at the Divecha Centre for Climate Change and the Centre for Contemporary Studies in Bangalore.

The main project outcome was a large-scale, real-time animated digital installation (also called The Southern Ocean Studies), derived from climate model data. As a development from Cyclone.soc, the project produces modes of representing environment with a highly patterned sensibility; a poetics that reveals site not as a spatial/temporal continuum but a configuration of systems in constant motion. This poetics derives much of its sensibility from the sensation of 'presence' or 'liveness' that is expressed when the work configures its data as an expression of the interconnected systems referred to in the original data which was supplied from climate model outputs contributed by the British Antarctic Survey. 


Andrew Brown includes the project in a major overview of contemporary practice Art and Ecology Now, (Thames &amp;amp; Hudson, 2014) introducing the featured artists as 'operating at the vanguard of art practice' (p.8). For Brown the Southern Ocean Studies in particular highlights the importance of the public communication of climate science, but emphasises the innovation developed through using climate data and models towards an experiential form that also enables critical reflection:

While The Southern Ocean Studies thus simplifies the natural processes at play in the Antarctic waters, rendering them in a direct and accessible form that can be easily read, it also complicates our reading by demonstrating how the same processes are layered and connected to each other. Rather than isolating any of them for investigation, the projection reveals how these forces of nature together form a complex ecosystem of cause and effect. (p.130, 2014)

The Southern Ocean Studies was exhibited in 7 countries, was nominated for prizes at the Digital Language section of the File Prix Lux, Sao Paulo in 2011, and for an award at Screengrab New Media Arts Festival at eMerge Media Space, Australia in 2010.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>93005A5B-E341-48B7-A434-BD5016F337E6</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>543e27bac112c8.17932419</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Research makes contributions to international practices and research in the interdisciplinary and digital arts in that it depicts the environment as an interdependent system inclusive of social, material, technological and natural parts. In doing so it produces models of art practice that extend and transform scientific knowledge (and data) as affective and critical experience in an arts setting.

This use of data was explored further in a peer-reviewed paper published at the New Media Caucus in Chicago (2010) which argues for hybrid approaches to the use of data through art practice. This argument was developed further in 'Systemness: Towards a Data Aesthetics of Climate Change' published in the monograph Far Field: Digital Culture, Climate Change and the Poles (Bristol: Intellect Press, 2011). These publications contextualised practice in broader critical and aesthetic domains, and paved the way for further research into the potential of data as an artistic medium.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Research has already been taken forward into two AHRC funded projects (AH/E503667/1 and AH/M002322/1).

The subsequently funded DataArt@BBC Backstage (2009-12) explored how experimental practices originating in the digital arts could be applied toward data held by public institutions to produce novel forms of public engagement to produce more than a dozen interactive data visualizations of BBC and other current affairs data that was released via a public website. Selected projects were also published as open source software expanding ways for audiences to engage with the work. 

Following on from this project, I applied for further ARHC funding to investigate the potential of 'data documentary' and was successful with 3 separate applications. In early 2014 I was awarded an AHRC/British Council Fellowship at the National Institute of Design (NID) in Ahmedabad, India. 

An additional AHRC grant was achieved this year (Digital Realism: Visualizing the Social Through Digital Art Practice) to collaborate with the Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford, specifically to explore the documentary potential of big data. The aim of the project is twofold: i) to foreground the experiential and interpretive potential of big data through digital art practices (visualizations, images etc.) ii) to question how coverage of certain types and groups of user presents a problem of representation in big data.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>DB197939-9111-47C5-ADDA-EB43CEC57149</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>543e29509ea9c7.59150806</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.reconnoitre.net/bas/index.php</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D23217F7-57C9-48FA-BB27-D9FED7BD221E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Myriad couplings: toward an information aesthetics of climate change</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>NMC: Media-N Journal of the New Media Caucus</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2631ca01e4408fdc3c215726e50c6630"><gtr:id>2631ca01e4408fdc3c215726e50c6630</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Corby T</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>543ce5aa262102.16813320</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>388D9AFB-98F3-4B32-A715-2D38BF9A3017</gtr:id><gtr:title>A one page portfolio description of the Cyclone.soc artwork with images, for a section in this scientific journal on how artists are using visualisation processes</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f4c8297d6bca093e8457d3776367dc41"><gtr:id>f4c8297d6bca093e8457d3776367dc41</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Tom Corby (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>m_2109309132139e5454</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/H039198/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8BB67751-1AD5-4EE8-9104-089D5F236DDB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Digital Arts HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
