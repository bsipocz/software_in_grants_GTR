It is a new collaboration specifically formed to address two novel research questions related to the development and evaluation of technologically mediated learning by children with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD). The first question concerns whether allowing ASD children access to models of their learning held by the system (i.e. open learner models), improves their learning experience and achievements. The second question relates to whether learning in ASD children is facilitated by the presence of an interface persona displaying emotions whilst providing feedback and help on the children's learning achievements. Mathematics is the discipline chosen for investigating the learning achievements, as ASD children have strengths, and therefore confidence, in this subject. Groups of non-ASD children matched on age and ability will act as a baseline or control group. The proposed research is multidisciplinary. From a user interface and HCI perspective there will be an emphasis on user-centred design and usability in designing the functionality, representation of, and interaction with, the open learner models (OLM) and interface personas. From both HCI and psychology perspectives the impacts on learning for both ASD and non-ASD children will be of interest. A further novelty of the research is the intention to investigate the challenges of involving ASD children as partners in designing the learning technology they will use.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-08-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>489271</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>school visit with Aardman</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>66F340F9-77F8-459D-88F1-D3810D4A0918</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Children from a range of school visited the university, trialed our software and took a modelling course with Aardman animators (the made a Gromit dog)</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cc3c2e47dd39.79195777</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.bath.ac.uk/psychology/research/groups/south-west-autism-group/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The key findings has a link to the software that was developed through the project and is available to use.

Together we have been working with pupils from both mainstream and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) schools, to design educational software (Maths Island Tutor) to help with the teaching of Key Stage 3 maths.

To make sure the software we designed can teach maths in an exciting and useful way we needed to know the following:

The likes and dislikes of young people.
What motivates young people to learn maths.
The maths topics pupils can do easily and those that they may find difficult.

We designed software that children with ASD liked to interact with and receive feedback from. Although designed for children with ASD, the system can be used by all children learning mathematics.

It was very important to us that the young people who eventually used our software were involved throughout the project, but particularly during the design stage. We were keen to include their ideas and preferences in the software design to ensure the final product met their needs and was something they want to use.

In order to gather these ideas we chose to use a design method called 'Participatory Design'. This method involves running design sessions with both teachers and pupils at our partner schools. These sessions involved lots of different activities, from looking at the benefits and limitations of existing maths software, to thinking up new ideas to drawing out designs of the computer screen using a range of art materials (Benton supervised by Johnson).

The system used an open learner model, so the children can see what they have learned and what is to be learned.

The feedback so far from the teachers and pupils has been positive, and parents have been surprised at what the young people have managed to design.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The Maths Island Tutor is a great resource for all learners of KS3 maths, especially those with ASD.
