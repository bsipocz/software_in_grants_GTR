Louis XIV, the Scots Jacobites and the French Invasion Attempt of 1708</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Fellowship</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/I022716/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>In an era confounded by the sudden collapse of empires and the rapid dissolution of civil societies in times of crisis, we should be profoundly sceptical about claims that any polity is solid and stable. Yet textbooks on the 18th century British Isles offer just such a cosy vision. Because the Jacobites and the United Irishmen were defeated and the American Patriots can be written out of our island story, a suffocating orthodoxy prevails. It projects an era dominated by comfortable concepts such as 'politeness' and 'commercialism', and the wholesome march of the middling sorts towards their Victorian destiny.\n But what kind of stable polity undergoes two revolutions within one hundred years and lapses into internal war on seven occasions 1688-1803? Lord George Murray, George Washington and Wolfe Tone were all polite and commercial gentlemen, but they did their best to overthrow the existing order. And many of the wholesome bourgeoisie of Aberdeen and Belfast spectacularly rejected their manifest - British - destiny to take up causes that make no sense within the current paradigm.\n What then must be done? This vision is deep-seated, but one of its weakest points is its inability to cope with Jacobitism. By recovering a 'lost' Jacobite rebellion that had a serious chance of triggering a revolution as sweeping as that of 1688, I will directly challenge the paradigm. The '08 is uniquely well fitted to the task because it flatly contradicts the received wisdom on the Jacobites.\n Jacobitism was transformed 1701-08 by the collapse of the old English hegemony and the Scots' assumption of the dominant role. In the course of the political battles against Anglo-Scottish union the Scots then broke with their past and developed a new, radical ideology. At its core was a vision of a future Scotland in which a Stuart restoration went hand-in-hand with a new constitution that would have reduced them to mere figureheads presiding over a noble demi-republic. It would also have been a Scotland directly economically attached to France and its empire, and thus able to demand a far more equal relationship with England. Their success would have drastically rebalanced power relations between the three kingdoms in the British Isles. The polite and commercial empire of our happy orthodoxy was on the edge of a precipice.\n The key sources for this project will be the reports of Nathaniel Hooke and overlooked material in French and British archives. Hooke was a French secret agent who visited Scotland in 1705 and 1707 and then wrote two cold analyses of the Scots Jacobites' potential, backed up with an archive of Jacobite letters and memoranda. This was published in the 19th century, but most scholars have preferred to read the 1760 translation of his reports rather than the 1,000 pages of documents on which they were based. These constitute a major, missed source. The French also checked Hooke's analysis against other sources, generating a further mass of documents in France that have virtually been ignored. Nor has its legacy in British archives been systematically explored. Passed-over material is widespread and the papers of the Secretaries of State and numerous Scots noble and family papers are full of unexploited material.\n These sources will provide the basis for a complete revision of our interpretation of Jacobitism in Scotland, and this, I hope, will fracture the paradigm and open the way to a broad revision of our understanding of the British polity in the eighteenth century.\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit?\n\n1. Government and the civil service.\n2. The Scottish people.\n3. The wider British public.\n\nHow will they benefit?\n\nThose in government and the civil service will gain a better understanding of the making of modern Britain, and thus of its contingency and intrinsic fragility. The paradigm that will, hopefully, emerge from the dialectical process will have greater explanatory power than our present orthodoxies. This should improve metropolitan decision making by better grounding both governors' and administrators' understanding of the path to modernity, and particularly its weaknesses and failings.\n\nThe Scottish people will gain in that this project will change our perspective on a vital period of Scotland's history. A key feature of the post-Enlightenment vision of Scotland's past has been its characterisation of resistance to union with England as futile, short-sighted and against the best interests of Scotland and the Scots. This project seeks to overturn this interpretation of events and actors in the early eighteenth century by stressing both the power of the patriotic/Jacobite challenge and its rationality. Rescuing Scotland's 'path-not-taken' from the enormous condescension of an Anglocentric posterity will promote a better informed debate on the subject of independence.\n\nThe wider public will benefit in that a revised paradigm that better reflects the murky, fraught, and happenstance-driven process which gave rise to modern Britain will improve their understanding of its present constitutional tensions and political problems. In particular it will allow the English public better to comprehend the dynamics of modern national movements in Scotland, but also elsewhere in the British Isles.\n\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-06-23</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-24</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>87906</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>That the current historical orthodoxy regarding Jacobitism in Scotland in the early eighteenth century is fundamentally mistaken. It presents the Scots Jacobites as disunited and reactionary. In fact, in response to the Union crisis they developed a strong and cohesive underground that developed a radical agenda for a future independent Scotland. The constitutional reforms planned and promised would have transformed Scotland into a noble republic, and the elevation of the powers of the Scottish Parliament envisaged was not to be matched by the Parliament of Great Britain until the mid-19th century. I have also established that the British government's response to the attempted Franco-Jacobite invasion of 1708 was piecemeal, slipshod and could easily have failed to prevent a French landing and Scots uprising. Luck and the Royal Navy's efficiency saved Queen Anne's government from a full-scale civil war literally by twelve hours or less. This makes the events of March 1708 one of the turning points in the progress of events towards the present.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We need to revise our assumption that 18th century Britain was a stable polity. It was not, and the instability built into the system at that time is at the root of present-day constitutional problems. Because of a pernicious mythistory that states Britain was uniquely solid on this score for the last 300 years, governmental understanding of the current order - and its fundamental fragility - has been skewed and rests on very shakey foundations.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>915E1D7D-64D4-48D9-9229-2BC2F274A999</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dd9a12281a59.67237515</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I022716/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4CC238CE-229E-47B9-A4BD-01A3E3C7000C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Diplomacy &amp; Internat Relations</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3CE20DB9-873E-489F-BBC7-3F05BD0D900C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
