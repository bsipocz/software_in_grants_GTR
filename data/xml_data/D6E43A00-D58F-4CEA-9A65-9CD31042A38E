Germany and Europe since 1945</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/H008659/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The project analyses reverberations of the Second World War across Europe through the Cold War and beyond. It sheds new light on the complex legacies of war for generations of Europeans, and, through coordinated in-depth studies, develops a new theoretical approach. \n\nChallenging approaches based on the notion of 'collective memory', the project explores instead the relationships between 'communities of experience' and later 'communities of identification', which may not be closely related to communities of origin. Four particular themes intrinsically connect a later present to a difficult past: reckoning, reconciliation, reconstruction and representation. These are interrelated: a concern for reconciliation may be seen as a means of evading reckoning; the demands of reconstruction may entail a degree of selective repression rather than representation of difficult aspects of the past; ethical responses to the war may themselves exert a normative effect, overriding the possibility of some forms of representation. Each implies - despite the linguistic connotations of 'return' - an attempt to build anew under changed circumstances. Such attempts are coloured by later social, political, and also emotional and cultural contexts, in which imaginative engagements in film and literature play a powerful role in shaping aspirations and perceptions; hence the collaborative approach involving literary scholars as well as historians. Each strand of the project highlights one aspect, while the project as a whole aims to explore interrelations. \n\nThe project consists of the following elements, with the case of divided and reunited Germany central to all strands: Legacies of Nazi racial and political persecution in Austria, divided Germany, France and Poland; Transnational activities for reconciliation and peace across Europe and Israel and the values and assumptions underpinning them; The ambiguous legacies of occupation for former occupiers as well as the occupied, in Greece, Italy, West and East Germany; Experiences of migration as a result of war, comparing two communities; The 'emotional legacies' of war transmitted through literature and film of the German-speaking countries, focusing particularly on the possibilities of humour for representing trauma and suffering; Shifting representations of war and its emotional effects in the literature and film of selected communities, with special attention to the normative effects of 'acceptable' emotions on gender; and concluding reflections on the 'Reverberations of War'. \n\nThe project explores legacies of war through a transnational and comparative lens, looking at war-related violence as a phenomenon transcending the (changing) borders of European states. It thus develops a deeper understanding of national discourses and specificities as well as discerning the European dimensions and relatedness of the various experiences and discourses. The systematic exploration of communities of experience and identification allows observation and analysis of the evolution of subjectively perceived and narrated experiences of those directly affected through to later frameworks of reference that can be selectively adopted by groups not sharing the original experiences. By focusing both on the transmission processes and the active patterns of 'making sense' of the legacies of the past in different later circumstances, the project highlights both culturally shaped agency as well as changing political and structural contexts. It brings a genuinely multi-disciplinary approach to this complex, highly sensitive area, ranging from insights and provocations in the cultural arena, through familial and social reverberations, to political instrumentalisation and intellectual controversy in public spheres. The collaborative approach promises to develop fruitful new insights into areas which, although already extensively treated seperately, have not as yet been conceived and reconsidered in this integrated way.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project's emphasis on the European and transnational dimension of the repercussions of war is vital at a time of further European expansion and integration, contributing to a better understanding of changing historic 'fault lines' at a time when global recession widely entails a return to national discourses. \n\nWhile there are decreasing numbers of immediate survivors, former combatants, forced migrants, bombed-out, bereaved, and others who lived through the war, people of succeeding generations continue to be marked by and deeply interested in these issues. Those potentially benefitting include: members of the general public with an intelligent concern for the ways in which European culture and society have been shaped by the long-term impact of the Second World War; and professionals, including psycho-therapists, journalists, film-makers, novelists, and policy-makers. The Research Fellows will gain valuable experience in international collaborative research. \n\nThe project will inform ongoing debates about memorialisation, initiatives for reconciliation, the improvement of inter-cultural and inter-community understanding, and public education about a highly controversial past. The findings of relations between different communities (Jewish and non-Jewish, for example) in post-war environments such as Poland and Germany, where the issues have been of particular sensitivity, will inform public debate. Discussions on memorialisation, museum exhibits and public education will benefit from the dispassionate investigations of this project.\n\nNew source material will be analysed, including oral testimony, memoirs, diaries, letters, war crimes investigation records, and other archival sources of interest to film-makers (documentary and fiction), novelists, journalists and school text-book writers. The project's concern with the transmissibility of emotions across generations has an important practical dimension, reflected in the involvement of a psychotherapist in the project, dealing with the traumatic legacies of conflict.\n\nThose closely involved in the project will benefit by enhancing their skills, knowledge and experience, better equipping them for further academic research and teaching or other employment at a high level. The PhD students and Research Fellows will gain important transferable skills through their experience of workshop and conference organisation, by researching and writing substantial independent works, and by networking with scholars across Europe and internationally. They will have demonstrable facility in inter-cultural communication in several European languages and locations. Close mentoring, support, and work in a stimulating intellectual and collaborative environment will ensure maximum benefit.\n\nThe project will make findings accessible in a variety of forms. A website will offer archive materials, filmed interviews, photographs and essays. Dissemination plans include a public event jointly with the German Historical Institute London, the Polish Cultural Institute, the Goethe Institute, the Imperial War Museum, and other relevant institutions. The final Reverberations of War symposium will include sessions exploring the presentation of academic findings in non-academic contexts, with input from film-makers, journalists, politicians, artistic practitioners and therapists. \n\nThe PI has an excellent track record of collaborations with public education bodies, including the Imperial War Museum, the Foundation for the Museum KZ Buchenwald, and the Chancellor-Willy-Brandt-Foundation. The PI's experience includes production of a documentary film enhancing the impact of a previous AHRC-funded research project ('The 'Normalisation of Rule'? State and Society in the GDR, 1961-1979').

2&amp;deg; A digital platform/website : to communicate information on the progress of the Action (WG's for instance, seminar programme), create awareness of the Action in non-academic target audiences, in the final stage: communicate the dissemination scenarios
3&amp;deg; an academic publication which elaborates the final transnational and interdisciplinary model
4&amp;deg; practically usable concrete 'scenarios' (for instance a museal scenario, and educational programme) used to offer field practitioners tools to translate the often complex and theoretical insights to more easily accessible formats for non-academic stakeholders: certain civil society ngo's (such as heritage and remembrance organizations), policy makers, the general public. The development of such practical tools (scenarios) is one of the essential aims of the Action (and a specific Work Group will be dedicated to it).

In A Small Town near Auschwitz: Ordinary Nazis and the Holocaust, Fulbrook explored the development of Nazi racist policies and genocide in Bedzin, a small town and county in Eastern Upper Silesia, just 25 miles north of Auschwitz. Some 85,000 Jews were deported through the linked ghettos of Bedzin-Sosnowiec; almost all the Jewish citizens of Bedzin, around half the total population of this town, were murdered as a result of Nazi oppression; yet it has virtually escaped the attention of historians. Moreover, the role of mid-level civilian functionaries in creating the preconditions for the Holocaust has only recently become the subject of historical research. Civilian administrators have also almost entirely escaped public conceptions of 'perpetrators', who are generally seen as those engaged in direct physical acts of violence rather than the behind-the-scenes administration of ghettoization and policies of stigmatisation, exploitation, expropriation and starvation. Fulbrook's research focused primarily on the role and later self-representations of the Landrat (chief executive or principal civilian administrator) of Bedzin, Udo Klausa, who went on to a successful postwar career in the West German civil service as the first Director of the Rhineland Regional Council. Based on a range of sources, including private letters from the Landrat's wife during the war, contemporary archival sources, the records of subsequent legal investigations, the Landrat's 1980 memoirs, and survivor testimonies and oral history interviews, the book explores the implications of 'systemic violence' and the role of German civilian administrators as 'Hitler's willing functionaries'. It also reflects on the character of later memories, in an effort to probe beyond the familiar focus on acts of physical violence and atrocities, and on the subjective role of the historian in confronting this history.

It helped to promote research conducted by a member of the research team and communicated the results of Fulbrook's research on the Holocaust and its legacy to radio listeners. The radio station has 428,000 listeners.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54621a790c6789.55930883</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Media (as a channel to the public)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Oxford Literary Festival</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DA20942F-4E4D-435F-BA31-2E0427D2A888</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Between November 2012 and July 2013 Fulbrook also delivered public talks at home and abroad, including two of the biggest UK literary festivals at Oxford and Hay-on-Wye where audience numbers averaged some 400 and included members of the general public, along with historians, educators and people with personal connections to the Holocaust.

The significance of this impact was as diverse as the audiences. Individuals from both Jewish and non-Jewish backgrounds around the world have emphasised how much the book has affected their understanding of themselves, their families and communities. In the German press, for example, an open letter to Fulbrook in a Rheinland newspaper thanked her for both enlightening the writer about the 'the big question of how it was ever possible for the &amp;quot;Third Reich&amp;quot; to have developed in what was a &amp;quot;Kulturnation&amp;quot;' as well as making aspects of the writer's own troubled relationship with his 'ordinary perpetrator' father more comprehensible. Fulbrook has also received many personal e-mails. One German wrote: 'On a personal level it was a veritable eye opener of how we as a family have rationalised my own grand-father's role in the fascist system'. An American wrote: 'Most importantly, you have made me ask myself a very uncomfortable question. Where in 2012 are our blinkers?' A child of survivors wrote that this is 'a personal and important book that should generate a lot of discussion about the German organizational structure that allowed the murder of our Polish Jewish families to happen with bureaucratic precision and antiseptic decision-making. And then convinced themselves that they were innocent.' Many more could be quoted. 
Fulbrook's research also contributed to changing the way in which the legacy of a German administrator was commemorated by his successors. Central to Fulbrook's research [d] was the complicated legacy of Udo Klausa (the former Nazi civilian administrator of Bedzin and the first post-war Director of the Rhineland Regional Council (LVR) in North-Rhine Westphalia 1954-1975). On 30 May 2012 Fulbrook delivered a public lecture at D&amp;uuml;sseldorf University to an audience including current representatives of the Rhineland Regional Council. As a result of Fulbrook's research the Rhineland Regional Council withdrew from their website an adulatory biography of Klausa and amended their public exhibitions.
Research on the GDR also reached a wide public through panel events and media presentations, leaving an online legacy in podcasts and transcripts. These ranged from an event with the President of the Humboldt University Berlin, through small discussions with former dissidents and Christians in a church in East Berlin, to an interview with Geraldine Doogue on 'Saturday Extra', Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Radio National, 7 November 2009 (weekly audience 126,000). The significance of Fulbrook's work on 'perfectly normal lives' in the GDR for German self-understandings and public debates is reflected in both popular and scholarly reviews, including the prestigious daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (14 Jan 2009), the G&amp;ouml;ttingen Institute for Research on Democracy (18 May 2010) and the Institute for Civic Education.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54621e3df32bd5.23602314</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop 'SPEAKING SUBJECTS: THEORY AND PRACTICE OF ORAL HISTORY IN THE EASTERN BLOC'</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7ED131CC-E42D-454A-9AF4-D3E423D00637</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Keynote at workshop 'SPEAKING SUBJECTS: THEORY AND PRACTICE OF ORAL HISTORY IN THE EASTERN BLOC'

Fulbrook's research has influenced the teaching of modern German history in secondary schools, and been used to develop widely used educational resources. In 2007, she released a documentary film on the GDR, Behind the Wall: 'Perfectly Normal Lives' in the GDR, based on the AHRC-sponsored collaborative research project and using archival material, location footage, and oral history interviews. 1,000 copies of the film were distributed and it has been adopted for teaching and extracurricular purposes in universities and public education centres in the USA, Europe and the UK, such as QMUL; benefits for learning outcomes include the 'appeal to students to learn about individual experience via filmed interviews' [8]. Sections of the film were also adopted as teaching materials for the OCR A Level history syllabus. 
Fulbrook was requested to write chapters 5 and 6 in Dictatorship and Democracy in Germany 1919-1963 (Heinemann: OCR History A Level, 2008), and collate research-based sources for the accompanying LiveText materials and CD Rom. These materials were based on Fulbrook's GDR research, and constituted a major section of the module 'Germany under Democracy and Dictatorship' in the OCR History A Level Board's revised syllabus. Since its adoption in 2008, over 6,500 copies have been sold and the newly revised materials have been positively reviewed by secondary educators for The Historical Association.


Between 2008 and 2013 Fulbrook delivered 15 lectures in Sovereign Education programmes around the UK to audiences averaging 200-300 A level students and teachers.

Survivors and members of families from the Bedzin area were present. Individuals from both Jewish and non-Jewish backgrounds around the world have emphasised how much the book has affected their understanding of themselves, their families and communities.
The significance of this impact was as diverse as the audiences. Individuals from both Jewish and non-Jewish backgrounds around the world have emphasised how much the book has affected their understanding of themselves, their families and communities. In the German press, for example, an open letter to Fulbrook in a Rheinland newspaper thanked her for both enlightening the writer about the 'the big question of how it was ever possible for the &amp;quot;Third Reich&amp;quot; to have developed in what was a &amp;quot;Kulturnation&amp;quot;' as well as making aspects of the writer's own troubled relationship with his 'ordinary perpetrator' father more comprehensible. Fulbrook has also received many personal e-mails. One German wrote: 'On a personal level it was a veritable eye opener of how we as a family have rationalised my own grand-father's role in the fascist system'. An American wrote: 'Most importantly, you have made me ask myself a very uncomfortable question. Where in 2012 are our blinkers?' A child of survivors wrote that this is 'a personal and important book that should generate a lot of discussion about the German organizational structure that allowed the murder of our Polish Jewish families to happen with bureaucratic precision and antiseptic decision-making. And then convinced themselves that they were innocent.' Many more could be quoted. 
Fulbrook's research also contributed to changing the way in which the legacy of a German administrator was commemorated by his successors. Central to Fulbrook's research [d] was the complicated legacy of Udo Klausa (the former Nazi civilian administrator of Bedzin and the first post-war Director of the Rhineland Regional Council (LVR) in North-Rhine Westphalia 1954-1975). On 30 May 2012 Fulbrook delivered a public lecture at D&amp;uuml;sseldorf University to an audience including current representatives of the Rhineland Regional Council. As a result of Fulbrook's research the Rhineland Regional Council withdrew from their website an adulatory biography of Klausa and amended their public exhibitions.
Research on the GDR also reached a wide public through panel events and media presentations, leaving an online legacy in podcasts and transcripts. These ranged from an event with the President of the Humboldt University Berlin, through small discussions with former dissidents and Christians in a church in East Berlin, to an interview with Geraldine Doogue on 'Saturday Extra', Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Radio National, 7 November 2009 (weekly audience 126,000). The significance of Fulbrook's work on 'perfectly normal lives' in the GDR for German self-understandings and public debates is reflected in both popular and scholarly reviews, including the prestigious daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (14 Jan 2009), the G&amp;ouml;ttingen Institute for Research on Democracy (18 May 2010) and the Institute for Civic Education.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54621cf0d997b8.43294604</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Participants in your research and patient groups</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Press response to publication of A small town near Auschwitz by Mary Fulbrook</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CE7DD81D-3D58-44D3-B5BC-D9F828AA17CD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In A Small Town near Auschwitz: Ordinary Nazis and the Holocaust [d], Fulbrook explored the development of Nazi racist policies and genocide in Bedzin, a small town and county in Eastern Upper Silesia, just 25 miles north of Auschwitz. Some 85,000 Jews were deported through the linked ghettos of Bedzin-Sosnowiec; almost all the Jewish citizens of Bedzin, around half the total population of this town, were murdered as a result of Nazi oppression; yet it has virtually escaped the attention of historians. Moreover, the role of mid-level civilian functionaries in creating the preconditions for the Holocaust has only recently become the subject of historical research. Civilian administrators have also almost entirely escaped public conceptions of 'perpetrators', who are generally seen as those engaged in direct physical acts of violence rather than the behind-the-scenes administration of ghettoization and policies of stigmatisation, exploitation, expropriation and starvation. Fulbrook's research focused primarily on the role and later self-representations of the Landrat (chief executive or principal civilian administrator) of Bedzin, Udo Klausa, who went on to a successful postwar career in the West German civil service as the first Director of the Rhineland Regional Council. Based on a range of sources, including private letters from the Landrat's wife during the war, contemporary archival sources, the records of subsequent legal investigations, the Landrat's 1980 memoirs, and survivor testimonies and oral history interviews, the book explores the implications of 'systemic violence' and the role of German civilian administrators as 'Hitler's willing functionaries'. It also reflects on the character of later memories, in an effort to probe beyond the familiar focus on acts of physical violence and atrocities, and on the subjective role of the historian in confronting this history. In the few months between publication (September 2012 in the UK, December 2012 in the USA) and July 2013, A Small Town near Auschwitz, sold 5,145 copies worldwide (hardback and ebook). It received acclamatory reviews in the international literary press. The New York Review of Books called it a 'milestone in Holocaust historiography' (20 June 2013; circ. 135,000). The Times Literary Supplement (15 February 2013, circ. 100,000) suggested that 'few bring the professional and the personal into such compelling conjunction'. Jonathan Yardley, reviewing what he called 'this fine book' in the Washington Post (1 December 2012, digital and print daily readership 474,767), says that the account is 'absolutely necessary to an understanding' of the events and their wider significance. Even the Methodist Recorder (8 March 2013, 22,000) stated the book had relevance for understanding the human capacity for 'complicity in evil acts'.

The research has had an impact on public understanding of the contested German past. Pathways include public lectures, radio broadcasts, newspaper coverage, and the production of two documentary films as well as A Level source materials and school textbook chapters. The reach has included diverse audiences in Europe, the USA, Australasia and elsewhere. It has improved the knowledge and understanding of students and teachers in the UK, professionals involved in public history activities in Germany and interested members of the public. In the Rhineland, it has led to changes in how the legacies of former officials are commemorated. The research has been of particular personal significance to people variously grappling with the continuing legacies of Nazism and the Holocaust, and the East German dictatorship.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5463675884c248.49816228</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2012,2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Haye-on-Wye</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>63572E34-8878-40CA-A327-21B18F5DAA53</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Between November 2012 and July 2013 Fulbrook also delivered public talks at home and abroad, including two of the biggest UK literary festivals at Oxford and Hay-on-Wye where audience numbers averaged some 400 and included members of the general public, along with historians, educators and people with personal connections to the Holocaust.

The discussions are always lively and interesting.

The film series has sparked their interest in our research. Some members of the audience regularly come to events which we organise. They have suggested new films. Audience members have also reported that they think about questions of perpetration and complicity in new and complex ways.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5460e3210246e7.41184873</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ucl.ac.uk/multidisciplinary-and-intercultural-inquiry/portraying-perpetrators</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013,2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Festival of Arts</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>628BF3A2-8023-4F21-904E-311D6FD23C7B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>There was a lively discussion and a blog documenting the event.

Some 85,000 Jews were deported through the linked ghettos of Bedzin-Sosnowiec; almost all the Jewish citizens of Bedzin, around half the total population of this town, were murdered as a result of Nazi oppression; yet it has virtually escaped the attention of historians. Moreover, the role of mid-level civilian functionaries in creating the preconditions for the Holocaust has only recently become the subject of historical research. Civilian administrators have also almost entirely escaped public conceptions of 'perpetrators', who are generally seen as those engaged in direct physical acts of violence rather than the behind-the-scenes administration of ghettoization and policies of stigmatisation, exploitation, expropriation and starvation. Fulbrook's research focused primarily on the role and later self-representations of the Landrat (chief executive or principal civilian administrator) of Bedzin, Udo Klausa, who went on to a successful postwar career in the West German civil service as the first Director of the Rhineland Regional Council. Based on a range of sources, including private letters from the Landrat's wife during the war, contemporary archival sources, the records of subsequent legal investigations, the Landrat's 1980 memoirs, and survivor testimonies and oral history interviews, the book explores the implications of 'systemic violence' and the role of German civilian administrators as 'Hitler's willing functionaries'. It also reflects on the character of later memories, in an effort to probe beyond the familiar focus on acts of physical violence and atrocities, and on the subjective role of the historian in confronting this history. The talk sparked questions and a discussion afterwards.

Individuals from both Jewish and non-Jewish backgrounds around the world have emphasised how much the book has affected their understanding of themselves, their families and communities.
The significance of this impact was as diverse as the audiences. Individuals from both Jewish and non-Jewish backgrounds around the world have emphasised how much the book has affected their understanding of themselves, their families and communities. In the German press, for example, an open letter to Fulbrook in a Rheinland newspaper thanked her for both enlightening the writer about the 'the big question of how it was ever possible for the &amp;quot;Third Reich&amp;quot; to have developed in what was a &amp;quot;Kulturnation&amp;quot;' as well as making aspects of the writer's own troubled relationship with his 'ordinary perpetrator' father more comprehensible. Fulbrook has also received many personal e-mails. One German wrote: 'On a personal level it was a veritable eye opener of how we as a family have rationalised my own grand-father's role in the fascist system'. An American wrote: 'Most importantly, you have made me ask myself a very uncomfortable question. Where in 2012 are our blinkers?' A child of survivors wrote that this is 'a personal and important book that should generate a lot of discussion about the German organizational structure that allowed the murder of our Polish Jewish families to happen with bureaucratic precision and antiseptic decision-making. And then convinced themselves that they were innocent.' Many more could be quoted. 
Fulbrook's research also contributed to changing the way in which the legacy of a German administrator was commemorated by his successors. Central to Fulbrook's research [d] was the complicated legacy of Udo Klausa (the former Nazi civilian administrator of Bedzin and the first post-war Director of the Rhineland Regional Council (LVR) in North-Rhine Westphalia 1954-1975). On 30 May 2012 Fulbrook delivered a public lecture at D&amp;uuml;sseldorf University to an audience including current representatives of the Rhineland Regional Council. As a result of Fulbrook's research the Rhineland Regional Council withdrew from their website an adulatory biography of Klausa and amended their public exhibitions.
Research on the GDR also reached a wide public through panel events and media presentations, leaving an online legacy in podcasts and transcripts. These ranged from an event with the President of the Humboldt University Berlin, through small discussions with former dissidents and Christians in a church in East Berlin, to an interview with Geraldine Doogue on 'Saturday Extra', Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Radio National, 7 November 2009 (weekly audience 126,000). The significance of Fulbrook's work on 'perfectly normal lives' in the GDR for German self-understandings and public debates is reflected in both popular and scholarly reviews, including the prestigious daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (14 Jan 2009), the G&amp;ouml;ttingen Institute for Research on Democracy (18 May 2010) and the Institute for Civic Education.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54621c78235765.10663999</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Panel Presentation: Learning to Remember, Learning to Forget</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7DE7EA26-B673-4775-86D9-42A6B807999F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>30 members of the general public attended the presentation by all six members of the project, which sparked questions and discussion afterwards.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c85f3c909dd8.79393883</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Oct. 2014 workshop on Defining Perpertrators in Relations to State-Sanctioned Violence, organized by J.

Posted on April 27, 2012 by kseegobin

SEN Journal: Online Exclusives would like to present the following interview with Professor Mary Fulbrook, a Professor of German History and Vice-Dean (Interdisciplinarity), Faculty of Arts and Humanities at University College London. She was one of the keynote speakers at the 2012 ASEN Conference.

Vesselina Ratchev and Karen Seegobin interviewed Professor Fulbrook at the 2012 ASEN Conference, held at the London School of Economics and Political Science on 27-29 March, 2012.

1. What are the main themes you've been working on this year?

I've been dealing with the issue of collective memory, but am trying to replace it with communities of experience, connection and identification.

2. What is the best book on nationalism that you've read in the past year?

I've been reading too many books, I can't just pick one [on being pressed what stood out]. There is an author I knew of but suddenly read a lot of his books. It's Vladimir Nabakov.

3. What new directions are nationalism studies taking?

My interest in nationalism is related to Holocaust and German nationalism and nation-state construction in that domain. Within this field, I think that we're looking into much wider and more interesting questions. In the last few years there has been a shift from what were getting to be quite sterile debates about intention and functionalism and that kind of thing, to looking at perpetrators and victims and the role of ordinary Germans. I think Holocaust research is developing massively in various directions.

4. What was the key piece of news from the last year that you found the most interesting?

I guess what's interested me the most are debates over Putin, which is entirely unrelated to my scholarship, but is what I've found most interesting in the news.

We have published several articles on this subject and discussed our findings with various audiences at conferences and public engagement events. To this end, we have collaborated with various cultural institutions, such as the German Historical Institute London, the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin, and the Polish Cultural Institute.
In many individual events (such as Fulbrook's Holocaust Memorial Day lectures and other public lectures) there has been an impact on audiences who have previously concentrated primarily on remembering victims without considering fully questions about perpetrators, including, for example: the extent to which Nazi perpetrators were (or were not) brought to justice after the war; the meaning of guilt; and the extent to which mass collective violence can be adequately dealt with in courts of law or should be addressed in museums, exhibitions and memorial sites. 
The new perspectives developed in the research project have had an impact on groups ranging from schoolchildren through to interested members of the wider public. They have also been raised in discussion with museum professionals.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>2E4175FA-3033-4A3C-ABC4-EBFA077B55D7</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5463a1bd1af650.68812074</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project aimed to shift the terrain and parameters of debate beyond nationally-based 'memory' studies by developing new approaches to understanding significant long-term legacies of the Second World War in Europe. It focused on the disturbing legacies that National Socialist violence and genocide perpetrated in Europe had and continue to have in German-speaking countries and communities, as well as on those affected by the Nazi regime. The research examines how those legacies are in turn shaped by a later present. The project investigates in different and interdisciplinary ways how the experiences of violence continue to disrupt a later present. It also considers the ways in which the past is disturbed by subsequent responses to it, as well as pointing to disturbing issues that scholars, writers and artists face when they investigate the past. The different strands of the project consider conflicting, unexpected and often dissonant interpretations and representations of these events, on the part of those who were witnesses, victims and perpetrators at the time and also by different communities in the generations that followed. The individual projects enrich our understanding of the complexity of the ways in which a disturbing past continues to disrupt the present and how the past is in turn disturbed and instrumentalised by a later present.

The project extends our understanding of the legacies of the Second World War, and the ways in which these legacies both affect the present and are in turn shaped by the present. By bringing together historians and cultural critics the project has been able to analyse different but interacting levels: the past itself and those who experienced it; those who actively investigate and interrogate the past; and the disturbing issues that scholars, writers and artists - and their audiences - face, including ethical issues and the wider impact of interventions in the past.

The project has engaged with and also challenged concepts that have become key to analyzing the Second World War and its effects. It offers a critical examination of expectations and norms of representation; it challenges widely used categories such as collective memory; and it provides critical perspectives on ways in which the past has been instrumentalised, whether for political, cultural or historiographical reasons. At the same time, the project has opened up new avenues of inquiry and interpretation that help us to understand better some of the issues with which such approaches have sought to grapple.

Our research has been interdisciplinary: it has taken seriously the ways in which people inhabit a world of physical spaces and cultural meanings, in which works of literature, art and film are significant interventions in historical processes and self-understandings, not only 'representing' but actively affecting the course of history. It is only as historians, film critics and literary scholars work together, drawing also on the insights of the social sciences and psychology, that we have gained a better understanding of the complex reverberations of a violent and still disturbing past.

Our research has in various ways engaged with the key themes of representation, reconciliation, reckoning and reconstruction. We have asked, first, why particular pasts may be acutely disturbing for some groups and not others. Which communities are particularly disturbed by what aspects of the Nazi past? Under what conditions do they (re)interpret and redefine their experiences? And how do different postwar conditions affect the extent to which, and ways in which, different people are disturbed by a disturbing past? Secondly, we have explored questions about the violent past reverberates into the present, elaborating the key concepts of communities of experience, connection and identification. Thirdly, we reflected on our own practice and what issues we ourselves face, as scholars actively engaged in disturbing the past for scholarly (and other) purposes. These issues may be personal, in relation to the immediate objects - or human subjects - of our inquiry; or they may be broader, relating to the wider impact and longer-term implications of the results of our inquiries. We too will be, in due course, a part of someone else's past; our own research on the reverberations of World War Two is part of wider processes of changing the present and shaping the future. Finally, we have considered how disturbing the past really is, and the ways in which our current engagement with it may be a form of fascination or pleasure, or a quest for moral coherence. 
Explicitly engaging with recent development and approaches to concepts of collective memory, the project members have sought in this way to develop a new approach to understanding the complexities of the unsettling and ever-changing presence of aspects of a disturbing past.

The research has led to the following key findings:

Mary Fulbrook's research explores representations of the past among different communities of experience, and patterns of transmission across generations, in the context of public confrontations with the legacies of Nazi terror. Survivors among a wide range of different types and groups of victims of Nazi persecution had divergent post-war experiences of 'return' or unwilling relocation, shaping strategies of coping and bearing witness (or not) under later circumstances; former collaborators, facilitators and perpetrators developed varying responses to political, social and juridical challenges. Exploring patterns of postwar justice, it becomes clear that (West and East) Germans and Austrians largely failed to bring Nazi perpetrators to justice. Moreover, key elite groups were never considered to be 'perpetrators' at all. And while those who were guilty claimed innocence, the innocent victims were plagued by survivor guilt. The second generation in each case had to live with the legacies, whether or not they knew much about the past. The second generation in perpetrator communities, particularly in West Germany, often engaged in identification with and commemoration of victims - but still found it hard to face up to recognising the perpetrators. The landscape of remembrance today is not a good guide to the past.

Furthermore, Fulbrook considers how the past raises difficult emotions - emotions which may be hard to control, which deeply implicate the self or compromise a sense of self-worth at a later date, and which mean that it is impossible to give a dispassionate account of the past. Such emotions do not map neatly onto experiences; they are also affected by the later contexts in which people seek to make sense of a troubling past. Fulbrook explores experiences and admissions of a sense of guilt or shame among different communities after the Holocaust. Focussing on both perpetrators and victims, those who were persecutors and those who were persecuted, she explores the relations between emotional expressions and varying historical situations. Why do the innocent feel guilty, and how do the guilty claim innocence? And how do patterns vary with historical setting, with changing collective actors, emergent cultural interpretations and differing socio-political configurations? On the basis of selected examples, she explores the relations between changing historical circumstances, different communities of experience and identification, and diverse legacies across generations. 

Stephanie Bird explored the relationship of comedy and suffering in post-war German-language literature and film. Her book has a number of complementary aims. It seeks to draw critical attention to the comic aesthetic at play in the work of key authors and directors. It examines the ways in which a comic aesthetic is deployed in their work, and how it functions to sustain or complicate the narrative perspective and modes of identification set up by the narrative. Thus comic devices may be used to sustain or challenge structures of empathy and identification that themselves depend upon a particular ethical or political position. Key to the book's enquiry is therefore the question of what comedy contributes to debates around the ethics of representing trauma, victimhood and suffering. It also centrally engages with the importance of comedy for interrogating and challenging our understanding of the notion of trauma and its prevalent use in cultural criticism. 
Her book does not analyse comic texts but those where a comic aesthetic is discernible at the margins. This aesthetic crystallizes the question of how we may enjoy portrayals of suffering: by integrating comedy into those portrayals, anxiety arising over the pleasure at others' pain is not contained by conventions of genre or form. Indeed, the relationship of pleasure and suffering is further illuminated by the way in which most of the texts assimilate comedy with the aesthetic modes of melodrama and melancholy, both of which are fundamentally concerned with suffering. Thus a further analytic thread running through the book is be a consideration of what comedy contributes to our understanding of melodrama and melancholy as two very differently evaluated articulations of suffering: melancholy as a privileged, masculine mode of perceiving and melodrama as a trivializing, feminine response.
The book casts significant light on key post-war German language writers and directors: Ingeborg Bachmann, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, W. G. Sebald, Volker Koepp, Reinhard Jirgl, Ruth Kl&amp;uuml;ger, Edgar Hilsenrath and Jonathan Littell. It is unique in using comedy as a starting point for offering new interpretations of their work. In addition, the study engages with central tenets of theories of trauma and representation. It is distinct in arguing for the importance of a comic aesthetic for questioning and resisting the prevalent use and ethical privileging of trauma, traumatic subjectivity and victimhood. Similarly, the focus on comedy leads to a critical appraisal of how empathy and identification are sought and elicited to sustain moral positions and how these positions are also linked to and supported by aesthetic modes, particularly melancholy and melodrama. 
 
Julia Wagner's monograph examines the efforts a small number of individuals made to bring Nazi criminals to justice. The successor states to the Third Reich shared a predicament: they had to integrate millions of former Nazis into their societies; and they often did so at the price of keeping silent about National Socialist crimes and the Holocaust. While the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG), the German Democratic Republic (GDR) and the Republic of Austria were preoccupied with building up their political and economic systems, the task of dealing with the criminal legacy of the Third Reich stayed low on their agendas. Despite the fact that all three governments publicly condemned the crimes of the Nazi regime, little was done to prosecute the perpetrators systematically. Consequently, those who were implicated in the genocide of European Jewry were rarely held responsible for crimes which had cost the lives of millions of people. A small group challenged this cross-societal trend. Private activists working outside the states' authority made it their mission to obtain justice. They investigated the crimes committed in the name of National Socialism against Jews, minorities and political opponents, tracked down those responsible and campaigned for their prosecution. The media soon began referring to some of them as 'Nazi hunters', but in fact the pursuit of Nazi criminals was but one part of a much larger range of activities. Critically, these individual agents also insisted that the courts and police live up to their duties and they co-operated with these agencies on various levels during the investigation of the crimes in question. Furthermore, they organized media campaigns to educate and sensitize the public to their cause. 

Her other outputs examine German tourists in Europe and reminders of a disturbing past. A mere decade after World War Two ended in absolute defeat for Germany shattering National Socialist dreams of world domination, Germans in East and West (re-)discovered the desire for international travel. By the mid 1950s going on a holiday was increasingly considered the norm rather than a luxury in West Germany and by 1968 a majority of West Germans were spending their main annual holiday trip abroad. While patterns of East German tourism differed significantly from the West, they were soon allowed to visit other Socialist countries. In the 1970s the number of East Germans undertaking foreign travel rose to up to one quarter of the population. Despite all differences, Germans in East and West were 'world champions' (Hasso Spode) in tourism. 
Many German tourists chose to spend their holidays at European countries which had been trampled by 'German soldiers' boots' (Axel Schildt) during World War II. The inhabitants of these places had often suffered brutal persecution and starvation. Now, a few years after the end of the fighting, the locals encountered Germans again - this time not as soldiers but as paying guests. 
Her contributions look at the relationship between tourism and the reverberations of the Second World War in Europe. Tourism was the first occasion when large groups of Germans met their former enemies under different circumstances. Most tourists set out to have a good time and enjoy the lighter side of life forgetting about the problems of everyday life for the duration of their holiday. However, they often encountered reminders of the violent past during their stay abroad. These could be incidents of resentment, such as name-calling, refusals on the part of their hosts to serve them or, in rare cases, physical violence. Yet most were more subtle encounters with the past, such as noticing the after effects of the wartime destruction or topics coming up in conversations with locals and other occurrences that triggered reflection about the events which had happened during the war at the very places they were visiting at tourists and elsewhere in Europe. These - often unexpected - reminders were at odds with the dominant narrative of a happy and successful holiday. They challenged the understanding of what it meant to be a tourist. Based on an analysis of the narrative strategies employed in first hand travel accounts by German tourists from East and West she asks how German tourists negotiated and reflected on this incongruity between holidays on the one hand and confrontations with the Nazi past on the other. Travel narratives allow us to explore how tourists tried to make sense of their travel experiences. Wagner argues that we can discern a number of strategies of selectively engaging with and denying aspects of the past. On a more general level, she addresses questions about the role tourism played in postwar Europe. She argues that for German holidaymakers, tourism became an arena for negotiating the legacy of war and for constructing a post conflict identity.

Christiane Wienand investigated discourses, narratives and practices of reconciliation in post-war Europe and Israel. Her research particularly focused on the role of youth and the young generation for reconciliation. She analysed various practices of reconciliation, diverging reconciliation narratives and public discourse on reconciliation from the early post-war years onwards, but with a specific focus on the 1960s and 1970s as these two decades can be seen as the heydays of post-war reconciliation efforts. For her project Christiane explored several case studies of reconciliation activities of young West Germans who traveled to Poland, France and Israel in the 1960s and 1970s in order to undertake practical reconciliation work in social institutions, at war cemeteries, memorials and museums, and in Kibbutzim. These young West Germans (who either lived through the war as children or were born afterwards) formed specific communities of connection and identification as they took over the task of reconciliation from the parent or grandparent generation. Christiane was particularly interested in those young West Germans who did their reconciliation activities under the aegis of two West-German organisations: Aktion S&amp;uuml;hnezeichen/Friedensdienste (Action Reconciliation Services for Peace) and the Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgr&amp;auml;berf&amp;uuml;rsorge (German War Graves Commission). Both institutions organised work stays for young West Germans abroad, and both organisations placed these activities under the particular notion of reconciliation or atonement. 
In her project Christiane combined various perspectives by analysing the ways in which the young reconciliation activists themselves perceived of their activities, how the notion of reconciliation was understood and debated within the two organisations, and how the reconciliation activities were placed and discussed in the wider contexts of German-French, German-Israeli and German-Polish post-war international relations. The primary sources she analysed range from ego documents (diaries, reports, memoirs) and oral history interviews to diplomatic documents, official speeches and newspaper articles. In order to gather her source material Christiane has conducted archive research in archives and libraries in Germany, France and Israel. 
Christiane has published the results of her findings in several book chapters, covering various aspects of her research, such as the contested notion of reconciliation, the political mobilisation of reconciliation activists, the historical development and institutionalisation of transnational reconciliation efforts in the post-war decades, and the disturbing aspects of reconciliation. In her monograph Dialog - Vers&amp;ouml;hnung - Frieden? Die junge Generation in Deutschland und Israel nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg, she concentrates on the history of German-Israeli relations and the role the young generation played in setting up and maintaining these relations under the ideas of mutual understanding and reconciliation between Germans and Isralis, Christians and Jews. 
An important result of Christiane's research is that a practical and discoursive focus on the youth as reconciliation agents made many reconciliation activities possible and welcomed in the first place. Yet the focus on the young generation at times also led towards obscuring and distracting attention from the violent past that has created the need for reconciliation. A wider ethical question arising from Christiane's research therefore is whether reconciliation can actually be achieved by those generations who have no personal guilt for what happened in the past. In other words: Is there reconciliation without perpetrators?
 
Gaelle Fisher's PhD thesis examined the changing associations with the region of Bukovina in Germany since the end of World War II. A former province of the Habsburg Empire, Bukovina was independent from 1775 to 1918, part of Romania until 1940 and is now split in between Romania in the south and Ukraine in the north. Bukovina thus ceased to exist as a political unit after the Second World War and was isolated behind the Iron Curtain for the duration of the Cold War. Yet in the post-war world, it remained a point of reference for a range of individuals and groups who had lived there before 1945. Bukovina's legacy survives in particular in the German-speaking realm where the region is known not only as formerly Austrian but also to have been the home to 120 000 German-speaking Jews and some 80 000 self-identifying ethnic Germans. The vast majority of these people were displaced during or as a result of the Second World War and large numbers perished in the conflict and the Holocaust. But exile organisations of Bukovinians such as the Homeland Society of Bukovina Germans (Landsmannschaft der Buchenlanddeutschen) and the World Organisation of Bukovinian Jews were founded after the war. Bukovinians after World War II can therefore be seen as representatives of wider interest groups such as German &amp;quot;Expellees&amp;quot; (Heimatvertriebene) and Jewish Holocaust survivors. By looking at the changing ways in which they conceptualised and enacted their relationship to the region, therefore, it is possible to compare how Germans and Jews came to terms with both the experience of violence during the war and the shared heritage of Germanness in Central Europe. Adopting a long-term, comparative and socio cultural perspective and drawing on macro, mezzo and micro level sources, this thesis shows that multiple discourses - Bukovina and Bukovinians as 'lost', 'expelled', 'immersed', 'forgotten', 'destroyed' and 'scattered' - coexisted throughout the post-war period. However there were significant variations in emphasis for different stances at different times. This is explained by the combined needs for belonging, compensation and coherence that determined people's approaches to the recent past and were significant regardless of their affiliation or later context. By taking Bukovina as a point of interaction for a range of people, discourses and practices, therefore, this thesis challenges the reliance on conventional national frameworks of understanding and offers a combination of historical, anthropological and social psychological explanations. In so doing, it also challenges the direct link often posited between experience and identification.
 
For her thesis, Alexandra Hills examined how effects of war or the totalitarian state threaten the integrity of human beings through their exposure to violence, and I explore the uncanny collapse of the animal/human boundary as a result of or metaphor for wartime violence and genocide. The result of the physical disturbance of the body caught in the political force fields of war and violence is the creaturely embodiment of human figures, who can no longer confidently be described as human. The ubiquity of the figure of the creature in Austiran and Italian literature after the Second World War is instrumental to this inquiry into the nature of how the body is warped by its exposure to politics as the notiion of the creature investigates how life is entrapped in the political on the one hand and vulnerable to physical entropy on the other. The concept of the creature encompasses the physical, affective and political figurations of the human body and self caught in political and material structures, and, as I see it, fears, hopes, anxieties and fascination associated with various types of creaturely, or uncannily animal-like, human bodies act as a barometer for attitudes towards victimhood, historical agency and responsibility. Animal-like human beings alienated from society and struggling for survival populate post-1945 novels and films in Austrian and Italian culture and the following questions may help elucidate how creaturely embodiment is linked to the legacies of war and totalitarianism in both Austria and Italy. Does the creature invite compassion on grounds of its presumed innocence and exposure to suffering? How is trauma embodied as a physical scar or stigma, and can a recourse to trauma an physical suffering upset ethical boundaries between victims and perpetrators, and between innocence and guilt? Or are the embodied effects of trauma the stigma of guilt and responsibility, or conversevely the signs of violence and unjust suffering that command compassion and humanity? By engaging with the porosity of self/other, animal/human, and victim/perpetrator binary oppositions, my exploration of creaturely across generations and across timecales has hitherto demonstrated complex investments in the memories of racial persecution, political oppression, conflict and genocide in post-war Italy and Austria. What does the presence of creatures reveal about the attitude to otherness marginalisation and difference in Austria and Italy in the aftermath of the Second World War? These are questions that my chapters address, with reference to authors and directors from Pier Paolo Pasolini and Liliana Cavani, to Elsa Morante, Carlo Levi, Anna Mitgutsch, Thomas Bernhard, Ilse Aichinger and Primo Levi.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our research group's interest in communities of experience and communities of connection and identification has contributed particularly to research on victims and perpetrators, but is also of wider relevance in developing ways of understanding the aftermath of collective violence among different groups in changing historical circumstances. 

UCL is now cooperating with filmmaker Luke Holland in creating a significant archive of filmed interviews with elderly individuals who played some part as perpetrators, accomplices or bystander-witnesses in Nazi crimes. These activities contribute directly to tnew research on violence and on perpetrators, functionaries, and beneficiaries. This will also play a role in questions of memorialisation, museums, and public education.

The focus on the interrelations between historical developments, questions of justice, cultural representations and self-representations will also have implications for a variety of future research projects.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>78B5021D-879F-4414-A58E-6289E9FFF566</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5463a3862faf35.66808687</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.reverberations-of-war.net</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Post-graduate training course: 'Ethics and Representation'</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E8A25909-8297-435B-B80C-61FDDE2D18BE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Post graduate students develop a more nuanced and critical response to the question of how the violent past is represented in literature and history and the ethical questions raised by different types of representation.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>546398661fe432.85079255</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Post-graduate training course: 'Trauma'</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8B9087CA-0AA6-4964-860A-91162153A19B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Post-graduate students in the Humanities develop a more critical and nuanced understanding of trauma, its definition across disciplines, and its use as a critical category.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>546391f98a33b3.17535629</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>By holding a series of interdisciplinary workshops a model of critical enquiry was developed based on the notion of communities of experience, identification and connection.

All elements of the project approach their topics from a European perspective, whether through systematic comparisons of cases, through analysis of 'entangled histories', or investigation of transnational networks and mutual influences. The elements are linked through their attempts to address sources ranging from highly individual 'ego documents' to representations in literature, the mass media or political debates, in the light of a shared analytical framework.
Our project thus takes a broad European focus, going beyond the writing of parallel national histories by looking at the experience of war-related violence as a phenomenon transcending the (changing) borders of European states. By looking at long-term legacies through a transnational and comparative lens, we seek to develop a deeper understanding of the national discourses and specificities as well as discerning the European dimensions and relatedness of the various experiences and discourses. While German aggression in World War Two is our point of departure, we are not looking at Germany or any other country as an isolated case but in a constantly changing, wider framework.

Secondly, we seek to shift the focus of 'collective memory' studies that tend to posit distinctive communities of memory. We aim instead to explore systematically, with respect to well-defined cases, communities of experience and identification. This allows us to observe and analyse the evolution of conceptions from the subjectively perceived and narrated experiences of those directly affected through to later frameworks of reference that can be selectively adopted by groups not sharing the original experiences. These groups may choose to 'identify' with communities other than those of their own familial, religious, social or political origins. By focusing both on the transmission processes and the active patterns of 'making sense' of the legacies of the past in different later circumstances, we highlight both culturally shaped agency as well as changing political and structural contexts.

Thirdly, we bring a genuinely multi-disciplinary approach to this complex, highly sensitive area, ranging from insights and provocations in the cultural arena, through familial and social reverberations, to political instrumentalisation and intellectual controversy in public spheres.
