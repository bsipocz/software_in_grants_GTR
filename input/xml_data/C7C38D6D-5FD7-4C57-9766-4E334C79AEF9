We run a busy science centre in Cardiff Bay and provide a major schools outreach service to all areas of Wales. 

Our outreach programme tackles the barriers of distance and geography in Wales by taking our workshops to communities which are less likely to access Techniquest in Cardiff. We overcome social and educational barriers by actively targeting the most challenged schools. Techniquest also works with Chwarae Teg to ensure that all workshops are gender neutral and that they encourage girls to consider STEM study and careers as viable and fulfilling options.

Over the past 5 years, we have invested to develop and modernise our schools services. Two years ago, we reached nearly 7,000 KS3 and KS4 pupils in south east Wales where we deliver our programmes directly, and we reached 15,000 last year. We know that there is demand for our workshops. In 2015/16, we want to reach nearly 25,000 secondary school pupils across Wales with help from our partners at Techniquest Glyndwr and others. This will be a substantial increase in Techniquest's impact. 

Techniquest has consulted with LEAs, science teachers, and the Welsh Government, who have identified that our outreach service is valued because it addresses:
The lack of innovative science resources in local schools and communities
The difficulty of travelling from school to fixed sites due to distance and cost
The difficulty for teachers of leaving school classes due to timetable/staffing constraints
The difficulty of motivating female participants to engage with STEM.

Our outreach programme uses workshops and shows, capable of reaching large numbers of young people. 

At present, there is a significant gap in our delivery to Key Stage 3 in schools. Our current KS3 menu is mainly maths related and there is a clear desire for science and engineering workshops to be offered, particularly when they give pupils an understanding of the world of work, practical applications of the science learned in schools and careers available as a result. 

We want to develop a new KS3 Physics Workshop, which will help us target STFC priority audiences, specifically young people and their teachers. We will also target all of STFC's priority under-represented audiences, by ensuring that our work reaches out to girls and young women, is accessible to underperforming schools (through not charging schools for delivery), and enabling schools in geographically remote areas (much of Wales) to engage in STEM activity. 

Techniquest's outreach workshops are designed to provide exciting experiences that are difficult for schools to provide themselves. Each runs for 50 minutes to fit with school timetables, and is produced for groups of up to 30. All programmes support teachers and pupils with the National Curriculum for Wales and teachers are supplied with post visit resources to enable teachers to extend the learning following the programme. Each will typically be 'booked' by schools for 3-5 sessions in one day, ensuring that the maximum number of pupils can be reached with the available funding.

Once it is developed, the KS3 Physics Workshop will become part of the portfolio of workshops offered to schools in south east Wales, which represents some of the most underperforming schools and deprived areas. Our target is to reach nearly 17,000 secondary school pupils in the region this year at a cost of &amp;pound;75,000 &amp;pound;36,000 of this is secured from Welsh Government, with additional grants of nearly &amp;pound;10,000 from STFC and Royal Academy of Engineers; and submissions to charitable trusts to fund the remainder. On the basis that the additional fundraising is successful, we are confident that the workshop will be offered to up to 17,000 pupils a year.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>As part of Techniquest's ongoing outreach programme, the KS3 Physics Workshop will be promoted to schools in Wales, focussing first and foremost the most deprived areas in Wales. 

Forty secondary schools in Wales have been titled &amp;quot;Pathways to Success Schools&amp;quot; and are taking part in the Welsh Government's &amp;quot;Schools Challenge Cymru&amp;quot; programme because they face &amp;quot;challenges in their circumstances and stage of development.&amp;quot; Whilst it is good news that they are receiving additional resources and expertise to undertake a programme of swift, sustainable improvement, we know that more can be done. Pupils in these schools are at risk of facing many economic barriers to education, as several of the local authorities are high on the Wales Index of Multiple Deprivation, meaning that the pupils in these areas are typically at high risk of economic and educational deprivation, and deprivation due to geographic access to services. In 2014/15, we worked with 12 of these schools, focussing on the most deprived communities in Methyr Tydfil, Cardiff, Newport, Torfaen, Caerphilly, Rhondda Cynon Taff and Blaenau Gwent. 

The free school meals register is also used to assist in the selection of the schools targeted. A direct mail campaign approaches named contacts in these schools followed up by Techniquest's School Liaison Manager who contacts schools by email and phone. The Schools Liaison Manager also promoted the programme face-to-face at teacher conferences and other network events. Teachers also hear about the programmes through the National Science Learning Centre CPD courses run by Techniquest.

Information about the project will be disseminated through science centre networks such as ASDC (Association for Science and Discovery Centres), and ECSITE (The European Network of Science Centres and Museums). The workshop will also be made available to organisations such as Techniquest Glyndwr and our other partners across Wales. The online resources will be uploaded to Techniquest's website.

Prof. Roche through his various roles, including ESERO-UK Space Ambassador for Wales, will disseminate information on the project. On completion of the project, a final report will be produced and sent to the STFC. The report will also be disseminated to the wider STEM and education sector including: the Welsh Government's Department for Education and Skills (DfES), and funders.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-05-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-11-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>9995</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/N001842/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
