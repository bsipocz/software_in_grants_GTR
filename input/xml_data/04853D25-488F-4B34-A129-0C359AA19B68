Interestingly the skin works closely with the immune system to limit damage by environmental factors such as chemicals and infection. Skin cells can indicate to neighbouring immune cells when they are damaged. There are also a large number of immune cells (white blood cells) found within the skin. 

A lot is known about how the skin responds to infection. However the skin can also be damaged by other things, such as chemicals that cause allergies and the harmful rays in sunlight that can cause cancer. Less is known about how the skin responds to this kind of damage. Looking at the effect of this in mouse skin cells, it has been found that damaged cells can display a stress molecule that rapidly activates neighbouring immune cells to destroy them. But, unexpectedly, this can also activate another response that involves the body's whole immune system, similar to the allergic response seen in eczema or when the body responds to allergens (such as pollen).

This is interesting as it suggests that this stress molecule could be important in the development of diseases such eczema or asthma (which are connected and often passed on together in families). It may also indicate that the eczema/allergy response is an important way for the body to fight cell damage that may cause cancer.

The aim of our study is to understand how immune cells respond to this stress molecule in human skin. We want to identify if immune cells found in the skin can recognise this molecule. If they can, we are interested in what chemicals the immune cells make when they come in contact with damaged skin cells. This will identify if in humans this stress molecule can also trigger an eczema/allergy type reaction. If this is the case, we will see if genes that are associated with eczema affect the strength of this immune reaction. This research is important as eczema is a very common condition affecting one in five children in the UK. Eczema is also associated with asthma and hayfever. These diseases are becoming more common and we do not know why. If we understand this process better it may help us reverse this trend and develop new treatments. This stress molecule can also be triggered by cell damage that can cause cancer. Therefore, if we work out how human skin cells respond to this stress molecule it will also help us understand how the immune system fights cancer.

Our team of researchers is based at King's College London and are led by Professor Adrian Hayday. We aim to study this immune pathway in test-tube experiments. The cells that we use will be from volunteers that have agreed to take part in the study. Skin cells can be grown from hair follicles and we will also use skin that would otherwise be discarded after plastic surgery. We will make the results of this study widely available to scientists, doctors and members of the public.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Background: The NKG2D-mediated lymphoid stress surveillance response (LSSR) is implicated in the innate immune response to epithelial damage. Murine data has shown that activation of this pathway in the skin can influence the response to cutaneous antigens inducing a strong TH2 atopic response.

Aims: To investigate the contribution of cutaneous lymphoid stress surveillance to atopy in human health and disease

Objectives:
1. To understand the mechanism by which certain cutaneous sensitisers induce NKG2D ligand (NKG2DL) expression by keratinocytes.
2. To interrogate the pathway that may promote this response through the isolation, characterisation and functional investigation of human skin-resident NKG2D+ cells.

Methodology: Flow cytometry and qPCR will be used to establish if NKG2DL expression induced by cutaneous sensitisers is regulated at a pre or post-translation level (HaCaT and primary human keratinocytes). If post-transcriptional mechanisms are indicated microRNAs that bind NKG2DL mRNA will be investigated by qPCR. Cell signalling pathways that may alter NKG2DL expression will be also be investigated (such as DNA damage-response pathway). Skin-resident lymphocytes will be isolated from whole skin by direct out-growth from epidermal sheets or out-growth from whole skin onto bioengineered matrix. NKG2D+ cells (FACS-isolated) will be characterised by flow cytometry and functionally interrogated in vitro by co-culture assay. To investigate the role of the tissue environment lymphocyte responses will be correlated with filaggrin genotype.

Scientific and Medical Opportunities: This project will provide important new information about the human skin-resident lymphocyte compartment and NKG2D-mediated LSSR to environmental allergens. It will help establish if this pathway can influence the TH2 atopic response in man. This has wider implications for our understanding of the innate human response to epithelial damage and will lead to novel clinical studies.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The public and the media are interested in the effects of the environment (from sunlight to allergens) on our skin and general health. This proposal has the potential to provide new information about how the skin responds to damage caused by such environmental exposures ('stress'). This could have implications for our understanding of common disease processes, such as atopic dermatitis (AD) and systemic atopy. Specific issues addressed by this project are of interest to patients (suffering from AD and other atopic diseases), the general public, public health bodies and the private sector.

AD is common (often affecting children), causes significant morbidity and represents a therapeutic challenge. In addition it is associated with other atopic diseases and their prevalence is increasing. If NKG2D-mediated lymphoid stress surveillance contributes towards the aetio-pathogenesis of AD (and potentially other atopic diseases) this would provide a novel pathway to target in the development of new therapies. This is something that is clearly of interest and relevance to patients affected by atopic diseases, their families and the general public. Additionally by using chemical allergens that are increasingly common in our modern environment (known to cause cutaneous hypersensitivity) to induce NKG2D expression, we may identify a potential link between such environmental allergen exposure and atopy. This may provide a new angle of investigation into the increasing incidence of atopy, with broader implications for both the public and public health policy.

This proposal is primarily focused on defining an innate immunological pathway (NKG2D-mediated lymphoid stress surveillance) in human skin using reductionist in vitro models. This will provide new fundamental information about skin biology that can be readily translated into novel clinical studies (such as investigating this pathway in the skin of patients with AD). We aim to present this work at forums that include biotech/pharmaceutical audiences and if appropriate we would seek intellectual property protection to facilitate practical translation. This is particularly timely as there is already much interest in the manipulation of such immune pathways in the development of novel immunotherapies (drug/cell-based), for example for certain cancers. This research will be carried out at King's College London which has a well-developed translational research programme (more recently through the infrastructure of the NIHR-funded comprehensive Biomedical Research Centre). We are therefore well-placed to develop parallel and/or ongoing clinical research programmes into observations made during the proposed study.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>206290</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>200000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>NIHR Academic Clinical Lectureship</gtr:description><gtr:end>2019-11-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>King's College London</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>5D4BC59A-EB7A-4A22-9149-FBF61DAD8F10</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e0401139efd5.12888946</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-11-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>CC53C9AE-17E5-4D82-A781-17F2BB3B5225</gtr:id><gtr:title>Defining the lymphoid stress surveillance response in human skin</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Lancet</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6db68d4147724c4211273450f248b012"><gtr:id>6db68d4147724c4211273450f248b012</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Woolf R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5463c037743b04.53869143</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F032A8DD-A2A4-4998-8A22-D53AA0192CE5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Potential for innate-like responsiveness of resident T cells in human skin: a new perspective on tissue immune-surveillance</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Lancet</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6db68d4147724c4211273450f248b012"><gtr:id>6db68d4147724c4211273450f248b012</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Woolf R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56e03f5edb3192.08571105</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>05D02F0E-EF32-43F9-B159-5D1BCA1DA015</gtr:id><gtr:title>Characterisation of the lymphoid stress surveillance response in human intestine</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Lancet</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/19badc89636884913556604f3b4e7760"><gtr:id>19badc89636884913556604f3b4e7760</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dart R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56e03f5f06ca63.42437062</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/K002627/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>C6D70A71-8796-47BC-AFE0-CC2286E66A06</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Inflammatory and Immune System</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>CF950C9A-DB16-4E23-8AEB-94548777BCA1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>1.1  Normal biological development and functioning</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
