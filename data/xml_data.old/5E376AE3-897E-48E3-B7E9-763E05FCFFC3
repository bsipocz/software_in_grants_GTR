citizen.</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/J005290/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Every day millions of citizens do something creative, from knitting and genealogy to photography and choirs. These creative citizens, some organised in groups and networks, some not, are the bedrock of the creative economy. As such, they underpin the intangible assets of the &amp;quot;knowledge economy&amp;quot; upon which the UK depends for its prosperity.

At present, there is much that we do not know about our creative citizens. Why do they do what they do? What is the value of their creativity, to them as individuals and to their communities? How is their potential changed by the emergence of communications technologies which permit on-line social networking? Does inequality of digital access undermine this new creative citizenship? Are today's creative citizens capable of providing more local and flexible services, previously delivered by more remote public and private sector organisations? If their work is valued, what interventions and policies would facilitate their growth?

This research seeks to answer these questions by examining three manifestations of creative citizenship:

- hyperlocal publishing groups, writing neighbourhood news most often as a blog site have started to emerge in scores of communities around the UK, sometimes in response to the scaling back of traditional media;
- community-led design, which is increasingly deployed as a means of ensuring that new buildings and other products reflect the needs, creativity and aspirations of the people who will use them;
- creative practitioner communities, which take many forms: here we explore the value-creation that arises between relatively formal communities of this kind and the growing highly informal networks of individual creative citizens, many built around online communications platforms. 

Our aim in studying these cases is to generate data and insight about each case, but also to answer the more general questions set out above: what is the value of their work, to these citizens as individuals, to their communities and to wider civic goals? 

The background to our interest in creative citizenship arises from the way that on-line communications have enabled inviduals and small groups of individuals to engage more frequently, deftly and in greater depth with many types of organisation. Today, many companies design their products and services in close dialogue with users: this is routine for, say, video games developers, but it is also increasingly true of &amp;quot;smart&amp;quot; manufacturers of cars, toys and other consumer-focused industrial products, using Web2.0 technology. This shift from a &amp;quot;user pays&amp;quot; to a &amp;quot;user makes&amp;quot; approach supports the possibility of a growth in smaller-scale, more flexible and voluntary community services. Nesta, one of our partners in this project, has a laboratory for public service design based upon these principles. Glass-House Community Led Design, another partner, specialises in connecting designers and the widest possible range of stakeholders. The research will produce:-

- improved data on the value, scale and potential of UK hyperlocal publishers and how they interact with traditional media; plus working with our partner (Talk About Local) sharp insights into the conditions likeliest to support the development of successful hyperlocals and the tools needed to achieve this;
- understanding the value, potential and practicalities of community-led design, with a particular focus upon understanding the potential and limitations of digital media;
- an evaluation of everyday, &amp;quot;at home&amp;quot; creative citizenship which provides an indication of its scale and potential, along with insight into the most effective ways of providing gateways between the work of these lone or loosely networked creative citizens and more formal organisations and structures. 

Our findings will be of value to policy-makers concerned with the development of the UK creative economy, along with strong communities of place and interest.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our ambition is for this work to provide a reference point for evaluations of the scale and potential of the UK creative economy, considered in the light of contemporary media ecologies. 

Our target audiences for impact include: UK Government; the Governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland; local government; local enterprise areas; political parties; Creative England; the British Council; the Arts Councils; think tanks; representative and member bodies like the Community Media Association; journalism networks. We will use a range of conventional and more novel communication channels, including:

- a website and blogging platform;
- a range of media products, including best practice guides, platform interfaces and media applications (i.e. mobile phone video noticeboard), targeted to communities;
- academic papers, targeted to academics and policymakers;
- a scholarly book, summarising the research findings in comparison with other research and experiences, targeted to policymakers, academics and practitioners;
- three briefing papers, targeted to communities, practitioners and policymakers;
- two network events - targeted to communities, academics and practitioners;
- three strand-based exhibitions - targeted to practitioners, academics and the general public
- one conference, targeted to communities, academics and practitioners.

The research team itself is rich in impact-generation expertise. Hargreaves (PI) is a former national newspaper editor and respected commentator on media and other issues. His recent (May 2011) review for HMG on intellectual property has given him prominence in the debate about the relationship between the creative sector, regulation and growth. This builds upon his work for the Welsh Government (March 2010) on the creative industries. Dovey (CoI) is a leading academic practitioner in knowledge exchange, through the Digital Cultures Research Centre at the Pervasive Media Studio in Bristol. He also has a professional background in media production. Harte (CoI) is a leading figure in the Midlands blogosphere. Greene is an experienced collaborator with high profile companies (e.g. Research in Motion/Blackberry) and has her own diverse influencing network, as is Alexiou. Chapain's strongly interdisciplinary background positions her well in delivering academic impact, including through her work as co-organiser of the Creative Regions in Europe Network (www.creative-regions.eu/) and Summer School (http://nuke.creative.regions.org.uk/).



We have selected partners who have a strong route to market in terms of impact, namely Ofcom, the UK media regulator and provider of much core data on UK media markets; Nesta, the UK's leading innovation-practice body; Talk About Local, a pioneer in scaling up and propagating hyperlocal journalism networks with proven expertise at Cabinet level; and Glass-House Community-Led Design, which has admired expertise and substantial influence in its field. The partnerships involved in the third strand of the project (communities of creative practioners) are South Blessed, Knowle West Media Centre, and the Moseley Exchange. These partners provide channels of impact of a different sort where we are experimenting with behaviour change with our collaborators. South Blessed, a highly informal but innovative video channel based in Bristol, is largely self-generating and self-funded. Documenting its reach and potential will provide a high impact and motivational illustration of what can be achieved by an informal community of creative citizens; this aspect of our work will be influential in communities which lack strong connections to mainstream media and indeed higher education. Moseley Exchange is an urban creative exchange in Birmingham: many other networks like it can be influenced by well researched insight into the way it generates value using the networks that exist both within and between such exchanges. Our partners are our medium.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-06-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1142330</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Indigo Babies is a graphic novel which emerged from a process of co-creation between the research team and South Blessed, a community creative network in South Bristol.

Targeted implications and actions were drawn up in the report to inform our work with the following groups/sectors and, in addition to the key plan around a new representative body for the sector (see below under future impact plans), the following represents a summary of how we have used, and continue to use, the report's findings: 

Policy makers and political parties: The report has formed the basis of discussions with representatives of numerous political parties in Wales, helped by Dr Williams' affiliation with the Media Reform Coalition (which includes policy recommendations from our report in its media manifesto). It has also informed our re-writing of our guide for community journalists to covering the National Assembly elections in Wales co-produced with the Wales Governance Centre. A centrepiece of this initiative will be a launch event at the Senedd where hyperlocals are invited in to cover Welsh national politics from community perspectives. Unfortunately the centrality of Sara Moseley (SM), with her strong contacts and networks in Welsh politics, mean that the planned manifesto impacts of the report had to be de-prioritised, since she left her post in December 2015 and was not replaced. 

Media Regulators: OFCOM representatives attended our conference, and read the report, and while they valued it as context for their current plans they have informed us that while they wish to be kept updated about research developments, their strategic interest for the near-future will be focussed on commercial and community radio, rather than text-based community news media. The report has given us a strong evidential platform to continue to engage with the nascent post-Leveson regulator IMPRESS. Our research and expertise in the area, along with the networking and discussion opportunities afforded by the launch conference, were important to informing their strategic decision to represent community news publishers as well as more established news organisations. IMPRESS' application to become a &amp;quot;Leveson-compliant&amp;quot; news media regulator is now being considered by the Press Recognition Panel (PRP). We have also briefed the PRP on the significance and nature of the Hyperlocal news sector, and have met with them to share the results from our research (using the report) so that they can better evaluate the IMPRESS application. 
Tech companies and innovation funders: Since SM was so central to discussions with Google our progress in this field has been somewhat stalled, but C4CJ steering group member Richard Sambrook has since had discussions with the company and received indications that while community news operators have been able to apply for funding under the new Digital News Initiative, there will be no specifically ring-fenced funding for hyperlocal news producers. Our main area of success in this regard is the continued involvement of Nesta in C4CJ-led plans, rooted in the report's recommendations, to set up a representative body for community news producers in the UK. Others who are involved at this stage are: Carnegie UK Trust, Talk About Local, the BBC, and academics from across the UK.

Hyperlocal and community publishers: The C4CJ has drawn on the report extensively in its routine blog posts and communications with our network of community news producers, and it has been a constant reference point in on-going conversations with hyperlocals. The findings of the report led the C4CJ to update focus areas in the latest manifestation of the Futurelearn/Cardiff University MOOC (specifically the inclusion of the report as a resource in the MOOC, updating key statistics about the size and nature of the sector, and creating new sections on data journalism and live-streaming apps for learners). It has also given us a platform and evidential base with which to engage other hyperlocal support organisations globally, for example in discussions and mutual online publications with bodies such as Local Independent Online News Publishers (LION) and Local News Lab in the USA. 

The BBC: The report was referenced and discussed in the UK-wide BBC Local Journalism Working Group, which is attended by reps from Trinity Mirror, Johnston Press, and the Press Association, along with representatives from the HL news sector. This group has led to the BBC engaging with hyperlocal news producers in new and innovative ways such as: the Local Live initiative (a hashtag linking scheme to improve HL visibility and audiences, directly linked to a DR recommendation, and the BBC opening up its archive of local news, including the ability to search and re-publish BBC content). We have also draw on findings and recommendations in the report in the BBC's regular Hyperlocal Forum meetings, to discuss future BBC support for community news initiatives, specifically their role in supporting a representative body for the sector. Discussions continue with BBC Wales who are now considering a scheme to republish and credit stories picked up by the BBC from community news producers in Wales.

Future impact planned:

One of the key outcomes of the discussions around report is that the sector would benefit, in numerous ways, from the existence of a representative body for community news producers in the UK. Given that so many of our long-term impact-related aspirations rest on the ability of practitioners to speak and act with a collective voice, and to benefit from increased visibility among policy makers, industry representative, and the general public, the report and consequent discussions with stakeholders have led us to prioritise this as our main medium-term impact goal.
Building on the publication of the report we have discussed the possibility of creating a representative body for the sector at various events including our own conference, the BBC hyperlocal forum, and UCLAN's hyperlocal open data conference (where the idea was met warmly by many practitioners). We have also had discussions with the Nesta, Carnegie UK Trust, Talk About Local, and the BBC (who have agreed to support the initiative in various ways). We have now called a meeting of these groups to discuss concrete plans for researching options, consulting widely in the sector, and setting up such a body. We have also looked overseas at other models such as LION Publishers and Local News Lab in the US to inform our thinking around how a representative body may operate. 

The body, given the provisional name Independent Community News Network (iCNN), would seek to advocate on behalf of the sector, as well as provide backroom support of different kinds. The possible functions of iCNN include:
? Collaborative advert selling: grouping together community news publishers by region or even nation to secure shared deals with large corporations such as supermarkets or public sector bodies;
? Backroom support: shared services for members, such as legal advice or technical support, as well as training;
? Leverage sector-wide discounts/memberships: for example, a heavily discounted membership to press regulator IMPRESS could be included in an annual fee to members;
? Sell on content: iCNN could act as an agency in similar style to the Presss Association to sell on community news content to 'mainstream' news organisations ;
? Accreditation or 'kite marking': membership could be subject to certain quality criteria, giving members a 'badge' of approval and improving credibility of the sector; and
? Advocacy work: advocating on behalf of the sector in a much more coherent way, acting as a central point of contact for policy makers, news industry leaders and technology companies.
? Research and development: act as a test bed for investigation into areas such as business and revenue models and digital innovation, sharing learning from the sector.

This project took Andy Williams', Dave Harte's and Jerome Turner's definitive research on the social and economic value of the emerging community media sector and critical challenges facing it and, with our partners Nesta, commissioned community news expert and former OFCOM researcher Damian Radcliffe (DR) to write a research-rich report into the current health of the UK hyperlocal news sector. Integral to the report was a targeted set of recommendations and opportunities which have allowed us to cement collaborations, provide concrete proposals, and inform current debates, at a crucial time in the development of this sector (the report was called: &amp;quot;Where Are we Now? UK hyperlocal media and community journalism in 2015&amp;quot; and can be downloaded here: https://www.communityjournalism.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/C4CJ-Report-for-Screen.pdf). 

The main body of the report covers: the market context; community news content; hyperlocal audiences; community news publisher characteristics; business models and sustainability; democratic deficit issues; media plurality; discoverability of community news; the impacts of community news; and challenges for the future. At the end of each chapter (and aggregated together on p.33) can be found the targeted recommendations for various groups identified by Damian Radcliffe in collaboration with Sara Moseley (SM) and Andy Williams (AW).

The other principal key activity co-enabled by this grant was the Centre for Community Journalism's (C4CJ) &amp;quot;What Next for Community Journalism?&amp;quot; conference held at the School of Journalism on 9th September 2015. 165 people attended the event. Around a third were community journalists, a third people with an interest in the sector (from the industry, policy circles, regulatory bodies, etc.), and a third were academics. Attendees came from organisations including the BBC, Ofcom, IMPRESS, Archant Media and the Welsh Government. The event was covered in numerous media outlets including the Guardian, BBC News wales, BBC World service, BBC Radio Wales, and UK and US journalism trade publications. On the day alone the C4CJ Twitter account got 53,300 impressions (more than they normally get in a month). The report was discussed widely at keynote talks and during workshop sessions with attendees, and gained good exposure beyond the conference because of the media coverage we attracted with an ambitious and successful media/social media plan. Meetings and discussions with key strategic partners were held.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Glass-House Community Led Design</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>OU and Glass-House (Creative Citizen)</gtr:description><gtr:id>1D35FDD1-4630-4297-A5D4-2254B3D69ED8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Collaborative bidding

Targeted implications and actions were drawn up in the report to inform our work with the following groups/sectors and, in addition to the key plan around a new representative body for the sector (see below under future impact plans), the following represents a summary of how we have used, and continue to use, the report's findings: 

Policy makers and political parties: The report has formed the basis of discussions with representatives of numerous political parties in Wales, helped by Dr Williams' affiliation with the Media Reform Coalition (which includes policy recommendations from our report in its media manifesto). It has also informed our re-writing of our guide for community journalists to covering the National Assembly elections in Wales co-produced with the Wales Governance Centre. A centrepiece of this initiative will be a launch event at the Senedd where hyperlocals are invited in to cover Welsh national politics from community perspectives. Unfortunately the centrality of Sara Moseley (SM), with her strong contacts and networks in Welsh politics, mean that the planned manifesto impacts of the report had to be de-prioritised, since she left her post in December 2015 and was not replaced. 

Media Regulators: OFCOM representatives attended our conference, and read the report, and while they valued it as context for their current plans they have informed us that while they wish to be kept updated about research developments, their strategic interest for the near-future will be focussed on commercial and community radio, rather than text-based community news media. The report has given us a strong evidential platform to continue to engage with the nascent post-Leveson regulator IMPRESS. Our research and expertise in the area, along with the networking and discussion opportunities afforded by the launch conference, were important to informing their strategic decision to represent community news publishers as well as more established news organisations. IMPRESS' application to become a &amp;quot;Leveson-compliant&amp;quot; news media regulator is now being considered by the Press Recognition Panel (PRP). We have also briefed the PRP on the significance and nature of the Hyperlocal news sector, and have met with them to share the results from our research (using the report) so that they can better evaluate the IMPRESS application. 
Tech companies and innovation funders: Since SM was so central to discussions with Google our progress in this field has been somewhat stalled, but C4CJ steering group member Richard Sambrook has since had discussions with the company and received indications that while community news operators have been able to apply for funding under the new Digital News Initiative, there will be no specifically ring-fenced funding for hyperlocal news producers. Our main area of success in this regard is the continued involvement of Nesta in C4CJ-led plans, rooted in the report's recommendations, to set up a representative body for community news producers in the UK. Others who are involved at this stage are: Carnegie UK Trust, Talk About Local, the BBC, and academics from across the UK.

Hyperlocal and community publishers: The C4CJ has drawn on the report extensively in its routine blog posts and communications with our network of community news producers, and it has been a constant reference point in on-going conversations with hyperlocals. The findings of the report led the C4CJ to update focus areas in the latest manifestation of the Futurelearn/Cardiff University MOOC (specifically the inclusion of the report as a resource in the MOOC, updating key statistics about the size and nature of the sector, and creating new sections on data journalism and live-streaming apps for learners). It has also given us a platform and evidential base with which to engage other hyperlocal support organisations globally, for example in discussions and mutual online publications with bodies such as Local Independent Online News Publishers (LION) and Local News Lab in the USA. 

The BBC: The report was referenced and discussed in the UK-wide BBC Local Journalism Working Group, which is attended by reps from Trinity Mirror, Johnston Press, and the Press Association, along with representatives from the HL news sector. This group has led to the BBC engaging with hyperlocal news producers in new and innovative ways such as: the Local Live initiative (a hashtag linking scheme to improve HL visibility and audiences, directly linked to a DR recommendation, and the BBC opening up its archive of local news, including the ability to search and re-publish BBC content). We have also draw on findings and recommendations in the report in the BBC's regular Hyperlocal Forum meetings, to discuss future BBC support for community news initiatives, specifically their role in supporting a representative body for the sector. Discussions continue with BBC Wales who are now considering a scheme to republish and credit stories picked up by the BBC from community news producers in Wales.

Future impact planned:

One of the key outcomes of the discussions around report is that the sector would benefit, in numerous ways, from the existence of a representative body for community news producers in the UK. Given that so many of our long-term impact-related aspirations rest on the ability of practitioners to speak and act with a collective voice, and to benefit from increased visibility among policy makers, industry representative, and the general public, the report and consequent discussions with stakeholders have led us to prioritise this as our main medium-term impact goal.
Building on the publication of the report we have discussed the possibility of creating a representative body for the sector at various events including our own conference, the BBC hyperlocal forum, and UCLAN's hyperlocal open data conference (where the idea was met warmly by many practitioners). We have also had discussions with the Nesta, Carnegie UK Trust, Talk About Local, and the BBC (who have agreed to support the initiative in various ways). We have now called a meeting of these groups to discuss concrete plans for researching options, consulting widely in the sector, and setting up such a body. We have also looked overseas at other models such as LION Publishers and Local News Lab in the US to inform our thinking around how a representative body may operate. 

The body, given the provisional name Independent Community News Network (iCNN), would seek to advocate on behalf of the sector, as well as provide backroom support of different kinds. The possible functions of iCNN include:
? Collaborative advert selling: grouping together community news publishers by region or even nation to secure shared deals with large corporations such as supermarkets or public sector bodies;
? Backroom support: shared services for members, such as legal advice or technical support, as well as training;
? Leverage sector-wide discounts/memberships: for example, a heavily discounted membership to press regulator IMPRESS could be included in an annual fee to members;

We have also looked overseas at other models such as LION Publishers and Local News Lab in the US to inform our thinking around how a representative body may operate. 

The body, given the provisional name Independent Community News Network (iCNN), would seek to advocate on behalf of the sector, as well as provide backroom support of different kinds. The possible functions of iCNN include:
? Collaborative advert selling: grouping together community news publishers by region or even nation to secure shared deals with large corporations such as supermarkets or public sector bodies;
? Backroom support: shared services for members, such as legal advice or technical support, as well as training;
? Leverage sector-wide discounts/memberships: for example, a heavily discounted membership to press regulator IMPRESS could be included in an annual fee to members;
? Sell on content: iCNN could act as an agency in similar style to the Presss Association to sell on community news content to 'mainstream' news organisations ;
? Accreditation or 'kite marking': membership could be subject to certain quality criteria, giving members a 'badge' of approval and improving credibility of the sector; and
? Advocacy work: advocating on behalf of the sector in a much more coherent way, acting as a central point of contact for policy makers, news industry leaders and technology companies.
? Research and development: act as a test bed for investigation into areas such as business and revenue models and digital innovation, sharing learning from the sector. Provide training and information in specialist areas to support sector development.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56decaeb274c26.69780010-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Damian Radcliffe was commissioned to write the report (described above), and to contribute towards its launch at the (also above mentioned) conference. The C4CJ and Nesta were partners in the grant application from the ESRC, and also contributed &amp;pound;8,000 towards the costs of commissioning the report and running the conference. In--kind contributions were also made in the form of staff time devoted to the project by the Centre for Community Journalism.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Andy Williams successfully applied, along with partners at Nesta and the Centre for Community Journalism (with whom Williams works closely), for an ESRC Impact Acceleration Grant

This project took Andy Williams', Dave Harte's and Jerome Turner's definitive research on the social and economic value of the emerging community media sector and critical challenges facing it and, with our partners Nesta, commissioned community news expert and former OFCOM researcher Damian Radcliffe (DR) to write a research-rich report into the current health of the UK hyperlocal news sector. Integral to the report was a targeted set of recommendations and opportunities which have allowed us to cement collaborations, provide concrete proposals, and inform current debates, at a crucial time in the development of this sector (the report was called: &amp;quot;Where Are we Now? UK hyperlocal media and community journalism in 2015&amp;quot; and can be downloaded here: https://www.communityjournalism.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/C4CJ-Report-for-Screen.pdf). 

The main body of the report covers: the market context; community news content; hyperlocal audiences; community news publisher characteristics; business models and sustainability; democratic deficit issues; media plurality; discoverability of community news; the impacts of community news; and challenges for the future. At the end of each chapter (and aggregated together on p.33) can be found the targeted recommendations for various groups identified by Damian Radcliffe in collaboration with Sara Moseley (SM) and Andy Williams (AW).

The other principal key activity co-enabled by this grant was the Centre for Community Journalism's (C4CJ) &amp;quot;What Next for Community Journalism?&amp;quot; conference held at the School of Journalism on 9th September 2015. 165 people attended the event. Around a third were community journalists, a third people with an interest in the sector (from the industry, policy circles, regulatory bodies, etc.), and a third were academics. Attendees came from organisations including the BBC, Ofcom, IMPRESS, Archant Media and the Welsh Government. The event was covered in numerous media outlets including the Guardian, BBC News wales, BBC World service, BBC Radio Wales, and UK and US journalism trade publications. On the day alone the C4CJ Twitter account got 53,300 impressions (more than they normally get in a month). The report was discussed widely at keynote talks and during workshop sessions with attendees, and gained good exposure beyond the conference because of the media coverage we attracted with an ambitious and successful media/social media plan. Meetings and discussions with key strategic partners were held.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Partnership work with Nesta and the Welsh Government</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D3EEE5D1-C52B-4CFA-94A3-F6E1F590B5CB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Arloesiadur is a partnership between NESTA and the Welsh Government.

Its initiation was closely informed by the experience of two AHRC-funded projects: Media, Community and the Creative Citizen and REACT. By connecting and, consequentially, intensify and amplifying the interactions between creatives in areas as different as film-making and design or video-effects and fashion, we aimed to enable our regional business and cultural organisations to tap into Cardiff University's developing innovation system. Funding for this work came from Cardiff University, supported by BBC Wales, the Wales Millennium Centre, Cardiff City Council and Arts Council Wales. The breadth of this coalition enabled us to connect creative practitioners with completely new communities of shared interest and, at the time of writing, to commence a more ambitious second phase of partnership intended to establish a consortium connecting creative practitioners and local authorities, as Cardiff moves towards a &amp;pound;1.3bn City Deal expansion. We seek partnership with any organisation which shares our goals. By February 2016, Creative Cardiff had over 900 registered members and a Twitter following of almost 8,000.

Our impacts have been felt in numerous geographic communities as well as in domain-specific and in national and international contexts, academic and non-academic.
For example in hyperlocal news media, the research team has been active at the highly influential 'unconferences' of our partner Talk About Local, whilst also contributing directly to the statistical output of another partner, Ofcom, the UK's communications regulator, and informing the emergence of the Cardiff Centre for Community Journalism, an engagement programme funded by Cardiff University, with support from Welsh Government and others. 
Anyone who attended our Creative Citizens Conference at the RCA in London (or accessed it online) would have seen the strong connections into London Design Week, of which it was part. A keynote address by Paola Antonelli, Director of R and D at New York Museum of Modern Art, began by noting the linkage between our project's design identity and the design identity of the Creative Commons Movement. Geoff Mulgan, Chief Executive of Nesta, connected his organisation's work under several headings with the concept of creative citizenship, drawing attention to the political re-imagining set out in his recent book, The Locust and the Bee. An epic encounter between the diverse attendees at the conference and the leaders of four London political think tanks added seminally to our insights and ambitions for political take-up of our work. Jean Burgess, the leading social media scholar from Queensland University of Technology, considered a history of Twitter. Meanwhile workshops drew out national and international linkages between creative citizenship and related concepts in the DIY, 'pro-am' space.
It is also important to note the overlap between the work of the Creative Citizen project and other work currently being undertaken by members of the research team. During the life of the creative citizens project, Hargreaves (PI) has provided seminal input to the intellectual property/creative economy debate in the UK, Europe and beyond, drawing on creative citizenship thinking (Hong Kong/Australia tour in March 2016); Dovey (Co-I) has been simultaneously running REACT, the AHRC creative economy hub, with countless valuable cross-overs; Alexiou (Co-I) and Zamenopoulos are engaged in a mesh of projects internationally which draw upon creative citizenship and contribute strongly to relevant research methods; as is Chapain (Co-I) in the field of economic and cultural geography. Harte (Co-I) and Williams (Co-i) have become closely and further involved in the development of practice in hyperlocal journalism, one manifestation of which is the Cardiff University Centre for Community Journalism, set up two years ago and the first of its kind in the world. C4CJ is, in part, a result of the creative citizens project, and it has been our partner at key events. More recently, Cardiff University's establishment of a Creative Economy Centre and its emergent role in the City Council's deliberations on economic development would not have happened without this fusion of work around the theme of creative citizenship.
At the same time, our early career researchers have cross-pollinated from creative citizens to numerous other points (eg citizen movements in Greece) and will continue to do so. They have given the project its tech edge.
Our partners in community-led design (Nesta and the Glass-House Community Led Design, worked with us to produce the Creative Citizens' Variety Pack - 'inspiring digital ideas from community projects'. Glass-House's core work of helping community-led design projects to succeed has drawn directly upon all of the work in this part of the project.
We have also engaged directly with numerous other projects and activities during the life of this project. Particularly memorable was our encounter with the DIY Citizens group (based in Canada), but we have frequently met with great examples of creative citizenship previously unknown to us (eg The Reader Project, which promotes reading aloud in groups.). We have influenced and been influenced in countless exchanges of this kind. Hargreaves and Zamenopoulos engaged directly with senior officials from the Department of Communities and Local Government as part of a research council prompted series of exchanges.
The project's book: The Creative Citizen Unbound, is due for launch at an event in Parliament on April 19, 2016.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>549D128C-F1F7-42A6-8934-35946BC2C9B2</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>544f87ee11a735.99513351</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput><gtr:description>Indigo Babies is a graphic novel, produced as part of the co-creative activities between this research project and the South Blessed media studio in Bristol.

We have established that digitally afforded 'creativity' is indeed an increasingly offered and valued aspect of citizenship, but that important and demanding second order questions arise, for example, in establishing measurements of value and encouraging researchers to adapt methods in handling co-creative community partnerships. 
Building upon the emergence of 'creative industries' in the late 1990s; and the 'creative economy' in the following decade our work establishes the concept of 'creative citizenship' - with implications for many branches of policy in all levels of government. The agenda for creative citizenship covers, inter alia, the emergence of the creative economy as a category relevant to policy debates on innovation and productivity. It sheds light on themes such as education, communications, social wellbeing, political expression, infrastructure, open data, planning, design and the incubation of small companies, freelance networks and the growing army of the self-employed. The project thus aspires to flagship status within the cross-disciplinary Connected Communities programme. Taking the categories suggested for this RF entry, we add the following:
- new knowledge: (as above, reflected in a book, a journal special edition and a wide range of domain-specific publications); 
- methods: useful extensions of 'asset mapping' techniques and experience of purposeful and evaluated co-creation with communities in digital media projects;
- online media interventions: greater clarity about potential and limitations, importance of physical/virtual linkages;
- multiple collaborations and interfaces with related work, some captured in highly successful conference eg at London RCA September 2014 which staged debate with leading political think tanks, supported by book launch in Parliament (April 2016);
- value of transdisciplinary working confirmed, but practical team management and other difficulties also noted for learning.

1. Our partners and their networks. We already note significant adoption and promotion of our work by partners such as Ofcom, Talk About Local, Nesta, The Glass-House Community Led Design. This is very much as we envisaged it in our bid and is substantially domain-specific with the exception of Nesta's global leadership status in work involving the creative economy.
2. We have probed at the political and policy space, notably in an encounter staged with four of the UK's leading political think tanks at our London conference in September 2014. This helped us to think more clearly about the potential for a 'movement-style' approach to creative citizenship (possibly attractive to political parties) or, more likely, one which collaborates with related projects and actors (eg social enterprise) in a range of sectors or domains, based upon a co-creative ethic necessary in any democratic activity. We are launching our project book, The Creative Citizen Unbound, in Parliament, where the attendance list includes MPs, peers, business, social entrepreneurs and the odd digital celebrity (Jimmy Wales, founder of Wikipedia). 
3. We are exploring future funding for the engagement aspect of our work, which we think has further potential.
4. One of our participating universities (BCU) has developed a degree offer based upon creative citizenship. Others have applied our insights in adapted teaching strategies. Cardiff University has launched two major engagement initiatives: The Centre for Community Journalism (aimed at supporting hyperlocal news media needs) and Creative Cardiff (aimed at improving connectivity in the regional creative economy). Both these initiatives have attracted funding from partners outside the university.
4. There are important and even momentous interconnections between the creative citizen project and other projects of the same period. For example, REACT, centred in Bristol, has brought together a consortium of universities, led by UWE and the Watershed arts centre, staging events specific to creative citizenship and DIY culture and enjoying rich feedback loops between these projects, made possible by cross-over of relevant research personnel. In South Wales and South West England, the potential of the creative economy and the collaborative potential of universities and other players has been transformed in the period 2011 to 2016. There are also vibrant legacies in the London planning scene (see domain-specific knowledge contributions)</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>086F88DA-B276-44CC-814B-14E2FB2A9E23</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544f7ec0620f29.64026784</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Environment,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://creativecitizens.co.uk</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Citation by Ofcom - hyperlocal publishing</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>58DA3838-2B01-42FF-879B-56768C92FBAF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Quantitative data regarding the scope and scale of Hyperlocal publishing in the UK was supplied to Ofcom and published.
