Evidence of these cultural memories, or cultural blind spots, can be found not just in texts, objects or monuments created for that purpose, but in traces of the practices people have chosen to repeat, transmit and record, or to modify, transform and discontinue. In particular, popular cultural practices offer an insight into what those at all levels of society found important or exciting enough to pass on, and irrelevant or shocking enough to abandon. Popular film and popular music have recently been studied from this perspective, but this is the first large-scale research project to consider the capacity of popular dance to embody and communicate cultural memories.

The project focuses on the cancan as a prime example of a dance form laden with cultural memory and amnesia. The familiar stereotype of a line of women kicking in unison conceals a nearly two-hundred-year history of dramatic change from early improvisations by working-class male dancers, to contemporary film and street art. Dancers, choreographers, writers and artists have reshaped the cancan in response to contexts such as the French and Haitian Revolutions, the Revolution of 1830, the rise of first wave feminism, the emergence of post-impressionist and modernist art, mass culture in the inter-war years, and Franco-American tensions in the early Cold War, leaving residues of cultural memory in the dance's movement, form and meanings. Some of these memories remain highly visible in contemporary versions of the cancan, whereas others have been forgotten, underplayed or repressed, such as its early male performers, influences from Spanish and Afro-Haitian dance forms, and repeated imagery of the black cancan dancer. Contemporary representations of the cancan in European street art draw on these manifest and latent memories to comment on issues such as the French veiling controversy, and American military interventions justified in the name of 'liberty'. Performances and representations of the cancan, therefore, invoke, filter and reshape the past, aligning it towards particular visions of the present and future. The project will uncover this culturally and historically significant process that has previously been overlooked by scholars.

The first stage of the project will involve archival research in London and Paris. Important primary sources written in French will then be translated into English by the project's Research Assistant. These sources will be interpreted by the Principal Investigator, Dr Clare Parfitt-Brown, and will form the basis for a book publication titled Revealed Flesh, Forgotten Histories: the cancan, popular dance and cultural memory. The book will make translations of many little-known French sources and early illustrations of the cancan accessible to scholars and the public for the first time, and will be the first academic book focused on this dance form. The process of developing connections between the cancan, cultural memory, and other popular dance forms will also be made public through a series of seminars hosted by the Centre for the Study of Cultural Memory, University of London. Each seminar will bring research on a particular popular dance form/context into dialogue with research in cultural memory, and will be accompanied by live performances and film screenings. In these ways, the project intends to explore and vividly demonstrate to scholars, policy-makers, and the public, the capacity of popular dance to bring the past to bear on the issues, concerns and anxieties of the present by embodying cultural memories.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project resonates with current European (and global) political and societal concerns surrounding cultural memory, cultural heritage, and the value of the arts. Therefore, the project has particular potential for impact in the artistic and cultural sectors, and at the interface between scholarly and public debate.

Firstly, the project seeks to promote Anglo-French cultural understanding, benefiting both the UK and France, and their cultural relations over the long term. The book will unpick stereotypes about French identity and culture, using familiar (and less familiar) examples from French and French-focused popular culture (such as Toulouse-Lautrec's paintings and Baz Luhrmann's film Moulin Rouge!). It will also translate French sources into English and interpret them, removing barriers to British public (and academic) understanding of French and European cultural histories. These effects will be multiplied and accelerated by disseminating the research and promoting the book via the blog.

A more distinct group of beneficiaries are contemporary performers of the popular dance forms that will be the focus for the Dancing with Memory seminars. Performances integrated into the seminars will offer these practitioners knowledge exchange opportunities with popular dance researchers, feeding immediately into their creative practice and professional development. The project will also promote public interest in the dance forms, not just as cultural heritage, but as evolving practices, thereby potentially increasing performance opportunities for these performers.

Further beneficiaries of the research are British and European arts and cultural policy makers and the arts and cultural sectors they serve. The research will explore how cultural memories embodied in popular dance, art, literature and film have influenced, for example, French national identity, attitudes to French immigration, French relations with Europe, America and the Middle East, and the debate about veiling in public spaces. This reassessment of the impact of the arts on cultural memory has the potential to influence French and European policies on cultural heritage (such as engagement with UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage List), the funding of arts institutions, media coverage of the arts, and arts tourism in the long term. In a climate of cuts to funding for the arts and cultural industries, the project's exploration of the long-term cultural impact of popular dance could be utilised by institutions such as the Victoria and Albert Museum (whose Curator of Dance is on the project's steering group) to articulate its value to national and European agendas concerning cultural memory, identity, and heritage. 

There are several academic beneficiaries of the research whose impact could be felt beyond academia. The RA will gain experience of contributing to a publicly funded research project, including assisting with the seminars, and will be mentored by the PI to develop future career trajectories that build on the project work. The postgraduate and early-career researchers who will be invited to attend the Dancing with Memory seminars will learn about public engagement activities surrounding research projects, and networking across disciplinary boundaries. The project will, therefore, develop researchers whose skills extend beyond the conducting of research itself into collaborative, knowledge exchange and public engagement activities.

Finally, the research will benefit the emerging discipline of popular dance history by developing a methodology which connects it to wider political and cultural debates surrounding national identity, immigration and intangible cultural heritage. The project, therefore, develops the capacity of the discipline to have impacts beyond academia, and carves out a political and cultural public role for popular dance historians, while enhancing public understanding of popular dance research.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>174053</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>'Dancing Histories: Historical Methodologies' Curated Conversation (University of London)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7D0DD01E-63EE-4BDF-A2B0-938FF2500C94</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was a curated conversation between Dr. K&amp;eacute;lina Gotman and myself as part of the 'PoP Moves Seedbed: Dancing Methodologies' Symposium.

The first was facilitated by the two interdisciplinary seminars that took place at University of Chichester. These attracted several members of the University's professional services staff, as well as impacting on the work of professional artists who took part. One member of professional services staff emailed the PI after the first seminar ('Material Memories') to say: &amp;quot;Really enjoyed the seminar last Tuesday, its nice to get new ideas and way of viewing I've never considered before; one of the benefits of working in HE. And I learnt a new word, haptic (plus a couple of others that I wasn't swift enough to fix into my mind).&amp;quot; Another member of staff emailed the PI following the second seminar ('Popular Music, Dance and Cultural Memory') to say that he thought &amp;quot;all of the talks were really interesting and thought provoking&amp;quot;. The participants and audience members of the 'Material Memories' seminar included University lecturers and students who are also practicing professional artists. One artist emailed the PI to say that the seminar left her with &amp;quot;lots of food for thought&amp;quot; and another said that the presentations &amp;quot;threw up some interesting questions... I've been mulling all afternoon!&amp;quot; Both reported that they had received positive feedback from other members of the audience.

The second channel of the project's impact has been developed through the PI's engagement with the Frantic Follies Vaudeville Revue in the Yukon Territories, Canada. The Frantic Follies is a stage show offering the kind of entertainment enjoyed by the pioneers of the Great Klondike Gold Rush of 1898, including the cancan. The musical director and co-owner of the Frantic Follies contacted the PI after reading a book chapter that she had published just prior to the start of the project. The Frantic Follies has employed cancan dancers throughout its long history, but this has brought it into conflict with local historians and journalists who rejected the Klondike's association with what they believed was a disreputable dance form. The PI's archival research on the history of the cancan, as well as the Dancing with Memory project's concern with how the cancan is remembered (and forgotten), is therefore of considerable interest to the Frantic Follies community and its supporters. As a result, the PI was invited to Skype in as a special guest at the event 'The Story of the Klondike Cancan: Paris to Dawson City 1830 to 1900', which took place in Whitehorse, Yukon, on 10th February 2017. During the event, following a presentation by the Frantic Follies musical director, the PI posed questions to a panel of cancan dancers who had performed at Frantic Follies over its 47-year history, some of whom had also performed at the Moulin Rouge in Paris. These responses will feed into the PI's monograph, one of the project outputs. The PI also answered questions about her own research. After the event, cancan dancers in the audience and on the panel reported that the event &amp;quot;completely changed the way they feel about the dance. One of them (a wonderful girl with a very French accent) said: &amp;quot;After your talk, I am so excited to get on my cancan dress and get out there and dance it with brand new vision!&amp;quot;&amp;quot; (Email communication, 2017). The project is, therefore, impacting on the way Klondike identity, rooted in its history, is performed in the Yukon. In particular, it enhances the way the Klondike women perform their identity, a group who have been marginalised in the male-dominated history of the Gold Rush era. Such performances not only contribute to local identity, cohesion and self-determination, but form part of the identity that locals can express and capitalise on through tourism. The 'Story of the Klondike Cancan' event, for example, was part of the Yukon Sourdough Rendezvous festival. The PI will continue to nurture this mutually beneficial relationship. All public events that arise from this collaboration will be documented through photography and video, and shared on social media with the Frantic Follies community, enhancing the impact of the project.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>03ED5005-7E00-4A28-BC88-24E4F475E2B2</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56dd5004c96409.33510180</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>A major achievement of the award, meeting one of the key intellectual objectives, was to bring together research in the fields of popular dance history and cultural memory studies. This was achieved at both project symposia (University of London), and the seminar at Columbia University, New York, which was jointly hosted by the University Seminar for Cultural Memory and the University Seminar in Studies in Dance. At all of these events, popular dance researchers and cultural memory researchers were brought into dialogue. These encounters helped the PI to identify a key difference in the way dance/performance studies and cultural memory studies have approached cultural memory. While the former has focused on reasserting the value of the embodied memories contained in &amp;quot;repertoire&amp;quot; (Taylor, 2003), the latter has focused on archival memories residing in texts, monuments and the digital realm, for example. The PI has, therefore, focused the project research on the interfaces between embodied and archival memories. There are many instances in the cancan's history of embodied memories being translated (or mistranslated) into archival memories (texts, images, films), and vice versa. To interpret these moments requires the insights of both popular dance studies and cultural memory studies, and they have, therefore, gone largely unstudied prior to this project. However, such moments are key for understanding the interaction between bodies and archivable objects in processes of remembering and forgetting, and, therefore, crucial in gaining a holistic view of how cultural memory works. Bringing popular dance and cultural memory researchers together at some of the project's key events highlighted these issues, and facilitated the PI's development of a methodology to address this gap in existing research.

The PI's focus on the interfaces between embodied and archival memories led to another achievement of the award. The PI developed the concept of Protean memory to address the way that cultural memories transform as they transfer between bodies and archivable objects. The concept of Protean memory applies particularly to popular cultural memories, which are resistant to definition, codification and censorship. When threatened with such pressures, Protean memories are capable of morphing into a different form, from a textual to an embodied form, for example, as a means to avoid becoming fixed. When memories are traced through one form alone (texts, for example), it is easy to conclude that at certain times those memories disappeared or 'went underground'. However, the concept of Protean memories encourages historians to recognise such events as transformations, rather than disappearances. Protean memory offers an interdisciplinary language which connects the different forms that a memory may adopt through time, and enables disciplinary experts to communicate across the gulfs that separate textual analysis, dance studies, art history and film studies, for example. The concept of Protean memory, therefore, has the potential to enhance cultural memory studies by facilitating multi-disciplinary collaborations between researchers working on complex memory formations that manifest in different forms across time.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The monograph is now under contract with Oxford University Press. The PI will complete the writing of the book prior to the contracted deadline of September 2019.

The project's impact will continue to be developed through the PI's engagement with contemporary cancan dancers in the Yukon Territories, Canada (see Narrative Impact). This may involve the PI travelling to the Yukon to engage the dancers face-to-face in the project findings. The PI will explore ways in which the research can contribute to local performances of identity, the creative economy (such as The Frantic Follies Vaudeville Revue), tourism initiatives and the heritage sector (such as the MacBride Museum of Yukon History).

The PI and one of the project's core popular dance historians have identified a point of convergence in their research trajectories on which they intend to build a future collaboration. Their research converges on the question of how paying attention to the relationships between bodies and archival objects might lead to new interpretations of those objects. This potential project would expand the scope of the research beyond cultural memory to explore theories of New Materialism, for example. It would have implications for the work of historians, cultural geographers and archivists, as well as popular dance researchers.

The PI is in the early stages of planning an edited collection on popular dance and cultural memory. So far, the PI has gathered eight contributors from presenters at the project symposia and the networks of the project steering group. The PI has received unsolicited expressions of interest from two publishers and intends to publish the collection by 2020.

The PI will continue to update the project website and Facebook page as the project outcomes continue to develop.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>FFBDB568-E9F6-456C-9237-55EADF398D9D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dd50e2e04089.52268964</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://dancingwithmemory.wordpress.com/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1C01AF73-1DB2-4108-AEBA-F78E0BEDD280</gtr:id><gtr:title>Cancan vs. the State: archival traces of the battle for Parisian bodies</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/797672220072fdd4bfce293de4dc1635"><gtr:id>797672220072fdd4bfce293de4dc1635</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Parfitt-Brown, C.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56d825b8a6dd97.73459471</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>17E1C076-98B6-4B17-AC10-533F8A949149</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Oxford Handbook of Improvisation in Dance</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a62278be3ef64b01944f5fe2e4948cc6"><gtr:id>a62278be3ef64b01944f5fe2e4948cc6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Parfitt, C.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>56d81f6e1e8f73.81625926</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B830F069-5489-4AB5-B122-AF6F4B3B33FA</gtr:id><gtr:title>&amp;quot;Islamic veil + French tradition = Corancan?&amp;quot;: an image-based discussion</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/797672220072fdd4bfce293de4dc1635"><gtr:id>797672220072fdd4bfce293de4dc1635</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Parfitt-Brown, C.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56d826171ee070.12138336</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>02B3D437-1DAF-4DCB-9503-B5840E82FF2C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Remembering the Cancan: Popular Dance and Cultural Memory</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a62278be3ef64b01944f5fe2e4948cc6"><gtr:id>a62278be3ef64b01944f5fe2e4948cc6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Parfitt, C.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>58b401723f9f52.34237061</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>EC2D33E4-56AB-4F0B-8864-53ADAF0F5BD6</gtr:id><gtr:title>Performances of Protest, Power and Pleasure: improvising liberty in the early cancan</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/797672220072fdd4bfce293de4dc1635"><gtr:id>797672220072fdd4bfce293de4dc1635</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Parfitt-Brown, C.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56d8268ba95fd6.16518653</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4B093E2F-F7C9-42AC-8984-4139000B0110</gtr:id><gtr:title>'Dancing in Tight Places: power and pleasure in the early cancan'</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a62278be3ef64b01944f5fe2e4948cc6"><gtr:id>a62278be3ef64b01944f5fe2e4948cc6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Parfitt, C.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58b04a0f8069c7.50688082</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/L010879/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7B8CDA14-FE2F-4F7C-BCD4-87F84927DAC0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Dance</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F31E8E8D-3AD7-4986-8DA0-6646585E4B79</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History of Dance</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>451D5ECB-5F3A-44AF-AFF1-5D6A57BDFD34</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Dance</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
