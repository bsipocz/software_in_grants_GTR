1914-18</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/L008343/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Nowhere else in the whole of the UK does the First World War (FWW) have such an enduring and tangible impact on everyday life and culture as it does in contemporary Northern Ireland. The very existence of Northern Ireland (NI) as a political unit - born in 1922 - owes so much to the FWW and the associated fraught relationships that existed between Great Britain and Ireland at that time. It is within this context that a compelling case can be made to create a FWW Coordinating Centre in NI.

The NI FWW Centre will be in the right place at the right time to witness and record the serious and significant FWW commemorative activities that will occur in NI (and Ireland) between 2014 and 2018. It will provide not only the means to ensure that this momentous period is itself committed to history but through its activities and resources, the Centre will provide a service to a community with immense interest in and appetite for the FWW. This is true for both the Protestant community in NI - long aligning itself with the legacies of the FWW - as well as the Roman Catholic community, only now coming to terms with its place in the history (and heritage) of the FWW, the peace process allowing examination of what was for so long a hidden history. The NI FWW Centre will act as a hub of knowledge exchange and research coproduction across NI, through supporting community researchers within a framework of arts and humanities expertise and scholarship existing within the two NI universities, Queen's University Belfast and the University of Ulster. It will do so through a programme of research training and outreach events, developed through a partnership with National Museums of Northern Ireland (NMNI), the Northern Ireland Environment Agency, and Libraries NI. Four key areas of research expertise of international standing at QUB and UU will be used to forge linkages between community heritage projects and academic and professional heritage researchers.

Migration history, museum studies, material culture, and performing arts have much relevance for NI communities, as is borne out by recent HLF-funded FWW projects in NI, and through the Centre these and others will be developed during 2014-2016, coinciding with key FWW commemorative events and anniversaries taking place in Ireland. In this context, the Centre will help connect Irish and Ulster communities across the UK and Ireland, and indeed beyond, putting the community research projects on a global stage. Here especially the Centre's use of digital and multimedia approaches will enable NI communities to reach a much wider audience and engagement, giving new voice to the enduring past legacies of the FWW in Ireland, as well as building a lasting future legacy of the commemorative period itself.

Critically, the government of NI through the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure, fully supports this proposal (see letter of support), thus ensuring the involvement of those heritage bodies that fall within its remit (eg PRONI and Libraries NI). It also has very strong support from the university sector within NI and beyond, including leading universities in GB which also have expertise in the FWW and Ireland, notably Goldsmiths, University of London, and the University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. The NI FWW Centre will foster these research linkages and through them provide community researchers across the UK with a hub for meeting and exchanging knowledge and expertise about Ireland and the FWW. Using the facilities, resources and of QUB's new Institute for Collaborative Research in the Humanities, where the Centre will be based, and led by a team of dedicated, experienced, and enthusiastic public-facing researchers at QUB and UU, the Centre will capitalise on the well-established local community relations that exist in NI between the heritage and university sectors, as well as devolved government departments and organisations in NI including the Community Relations Council (CRC) and HLF.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Beneficiaries include heritage stakeholders embracing NI government departments; public sector agencies; professional and practitioner groups; creative and performing arts groups; the media; and local communities and the wider public, as follows:

NI government: Through collaborations with the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland (PRONI) and National Museums Northern Ireland (NMNI), and Libraries NI, the Centre will have close ties with the Department for Culture, Arts and Leisure (DCAL), while through its relationship between the Centre for Archaeological Fieldwork (CAF) and Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA) the Centre will also link to the Department of Environment (DOE). Areas of impact through these government department and agency links will include stronger and more visible public engagement and knowledge exchange addressing current policy concerns over increasing interaction for disenfranchised and marginalised communities. The Centre will also make substantive contributions to support and better enable these agencies to achieve their strategic aims and public outreach work, for example through creating resourced projects that improve public awareness and understanding of FWW heritage and the environment.

Museums and heritage: With a close working relationship with national museums and archives, including NMNI and PRONI, and local and regimental museums, such as Derry City Museum, North Down Museum, the Somme Heritage Centre, the Inniskillings Museum, Royal Ulster Rifles Museum, and Royal Irish Fusiliers Museum, the Centre's research and training activities with curators and conservators will provide a basis for developing new research and interpretation for public exhibitions, embedding advanced curating techniques and promoting awareness at the local and regional level. Active participation of community researchers in museum and archival projects will be a key element of the Centre's community heritage projects, enabled through agreements between the Centre and NMNI and the Irish Regimental Museums (see letters of support). Impacts include the coproduction of new content for interpretation, and via the Centre's digitisation training programme, making available FWW materials.

Community heritage: The 'informal' heritage community in NI is large and complex. The Centre will engage with a wide range of heritage groups with specialist interests, connecting their activities to professional research and heritage networks. The organisations so far consulted about these benefits include the Ulster Historical Foundation; 6th Connaught Rangers Research Project; Unionist Centenary Committee; 36th Ulster Division Memorial Association; Ulster Aviation Research Group; and the Armagh War Memorial project. Impacts arising from partnerships with these groups (and others) will include up-skilling community researchers, for example through training in digital techniques and workshops on curating and archiving; so opening community research access to resources and funding opportunities (including HLF funding), creating wider impacts through new audiences.

Creative arts: Through the Centre's creative arts priority area and the on-going collaboration between NMNI and QUB in scripting and performing a new FWW-based play, 'The Medal in the Drawer', the Centre will provide resources for and engagement with a wide and active community of creative arts groups in NI. This activity includes fostering the strong links between QUB's School of Creative Arts and the Kabosh Theatre Company and ties with NI theatres such as the Lyric, Playhouse, and the MAC. The Centre's Community Steering Group chair, Dr Winter Palmer, has extensive media ties, and as founder and artistic director of Replay, NI's longest established Educational Theatre Company and creative director of Mixed Peppers Theatre Arts Training Programme (for young people with disabilities), the Centre's creative and performing arts will engage disenfranchised groups.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>602987</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The Remembering 1916: Your Stories exhibition forms a key part of our 1916 centenary programme.

The Centre was established in January 2014 as one of five First World War Engagement Centres in the UK which work alongside community groups to explore the war period and its meaning for people today. It includes academics working at Glasgow, Newcastle, Queen's and Ulster Universities, amongst others, who have teamed with community groups, museum experts and people across the heritage and cultural sectors to produce new knowledge and understanding of the period.

The Summer School built upon previous initiatives events hosted by Living Legacies, including: Medals All Round Research Initiative (MARRI), which resulted in Of Bicycles and Fallow Fields, a WW1 drama written and performed by Omagh Robins; the event Music and Memories held at the Inniskillings Museum in June 2015, during which musician Tracey MacRory talked about the wartime inspiration for her music; and the visit of the Fermanagh Writers to Northern Ireland War Memorial in March 2016.</gtr:description><gtr:id>73C0F370-C58C-4B1A-9F81-9D78D52C5885</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The writers made new and deeper connections with the Living Legacies team; learned from the experiences of Marion Maxwell, Bellanaleck History Group, and their Cleenish Island project funded by HLF First World War Then and Now scheme; and made new friends within the recently amalgamated of Fermanagh &amp;amp; Omagh District Council. The two days represented not only a significant time commitment from the participants, but also one that would challenge their preconceptions of the war period and why we should remember. By the end they had produced new work, learned new skills about their craft, and had greater understanding of the impact and legacy of the First World War period.

For the Living Legacies team the two days provided an invaluable insight into the multiple meanings that can be drawn from the war period and how each person constructs that past in a way that has relevance for their contemporary lives. Collaborations were lively, the mood was one of generosity and mindfulness, and the work read on the final day was moving and deeply insightful.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b036fb70ede8.98944257</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>The Living Legacies 2016 Writers' Summer School</gtr:title><gtr:type>Creative Writing</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.corncrakemagazine.com/article/living-legacies/#more-444%20</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Medals All Round Research Initiative (MARRI) is a community drama project which will encourage groups to research, script and perform family and community stories that reveal an infinitely more nuanced and inclusive account of the human experience of a region simultaneously 'at war' with itself and with an outside force.

Building upon the formative work already done through the presentation of Brenda Winter-Palmer's play The Medal in the Drawer, and its outreach project 2014-2015, 'Medals All Round' combines the knowledge, expertise and facilities of Drama at Queen's University Belfast with that of the Creative Learning department at the Lyric Theatre, Belfast in order to create a model for interaction with community groups at the grassroots level (eight organisations have already expressed interest in being part of the project). The Lyric and Queen's will employ our expertise in Drama facilitation to assist these community groups in exploring their heritage in relation to the First World War. The groups selected reflect a broad range of diversity, including Protestant and Catholic communities, a Special Needs group, Prisoners/Ex-Offenders and groups from localities defined as areas of social need. We plan to provide each of the groups with an experienced Drama Facilitator who, over the course of 10 two-hour visit, will provide support and advice on using theatre skills to allow members of the community to tell their own stories.

Through this process, the participants in the project (both those employed within the project and the community groups they visit) will enhance their own skills so that they can continue to carry on similar work in the future. The project is thus designed to leave a crucial legacy-when the project is over, multiple community groups will have gained the knowledge and skills to direct their energies to the representation of communal narratives (about the First World War and beyond), and a group of young facilitators will have gained unparalleled experience in leading such projects.</gtr:description><gtr:id>75E71A93-E6DB-4C3D-B936-3196719B0B39</gtr:id><gtr:impact>On 29 February 2016, The Medals All Round Research Initiative (MARRI) culminated in an event at the Lyric Theatre Belfast with a presentation of the performances, plays and films that have emerged from our work with a variety of community groups from around Northern Ireland. The project began with a group of former QUB students being brought to each of the groups to perform an excerpted version of Dr. Brenda Winter-Palmer's play The Medal in the Drawer. With the play as inspiration and a starting point, the groups, with the help of a facilitator, began to explore their own ideas and knowledge of the war as we remember it in Northern Ireland.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b0368885c463.15612965</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Medals All Round Research Initiative (MARRI)</gtr:title><gtr:type>Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.livinglegacies1914-18.ac.uk/Projects/FundedProjects/MedalsAllRoundResearchInitiativeMARRI/NewsEvents/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Teesside University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Dear Mrs Pennyman: Letters of the King's Own Borderers Widows and Orphans Fund</gtr:description><gtr:id>834A3A9E-464F-4935-944A-C145C156516E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The research project is in the early stages of consultation and design.

For two days, on the banks of the Erne surrounded by the historic buildings of the Watergate, Maguire Castle and Inniskillings Barracks, the Living Legacies team worked in intense creativity with two writers groups, the Fermanagh Writers and the Omagh Robins.

The Living Legacies 2016 Writers Summer School was a new departure for the Engagement Centre. The Centre was established in January 2014 as one of five First World War Engagement Centres in the UK which work alongside community groups to explore the war period and its meaning for people today. It includes academics working at Glasgow, Newcastle, Queen's and Ulster Universities, amongst others, who have teamed with community groups, museum experts and people across the heritage and cultural sectors to produce new knowledge and understanding of the period.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58a48131c1f4e7.70674000</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.corncrakemagazine.com/article/living-legacies/#more-444%20</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Community excavation Grey Point Fort</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E932F068-F44E-49F9-ABA9-84F2498E7232</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Heather Montgomery (network member of Living Legacies) and the Centre for Archaeological Fieldwork at Queen's and Living Legacies excavation on behalf of NIEA at Grey Point Fort.

The subject matter was the history of UVF members from West Belfast in 1913-14 who served in the British army during the First World War. 
The day began with a talk at Cult&amp;uacute;rlann on the Falls Road, from Prof. Richard Grayson, whose research on the UVF provided the data on which the walk is based. The walk then passed by the homes of 14 men who were in the UVF in 1913-14 and saw action on a range of fronts during the war. The tour included impromptu stops at First World War-related murals and other sites of interest such as the Shankill graveyard.

Throughout the day, attention was paid to the significant number of ex-UVF members who served outside the 36th (Ulster) Division, some of whom lived in the Falls. Stops included: Cupar Street, Conway Street, Canmore Street, Argyle Street, Cambrai Street and Enfield Street. For further information, see:

Local drama groups performed readings and engaged in reflections on Bella's writings: The FWW themed short play entitled: Of Bicycles and Fallow Fields, written and performed by the Omagh Robins Drama Group followed. The play is a creative response by the group to key events of Ireland's decade of centenaries, notably the First World War and the Easter Rising. Inspired by Bella Dixon's wartime diary and WW1 letters and that were brought in to digitization workshops organised by the Living Legacies 1914-18 Engagement Centre (Queen's and Ulster universities) during 2014-15, the Omagh Robins have woven historical and newly composed narrative together, crossing generations and geographies.

This was part of the Belfast Somme 100 programme.

The First World War was the first conflict in which people started to talk about a home front. This was because people living and working at home were just as important to the war effort as the men fighting at the actual front. The illustrated talk examined the impact of the First World War on the domestic, economic, social and political life of Ulster, including the effect on women and children, industry and agriculture.

Dr Whan began by setting the scene by looking at Ulster on the eve of the war, including the pre-war Home Rule crisis (with the creation of the Ulster and Irish Volunteers) and the local suffrage movement. He then spoke about recruitment activities for the three new Irish divisions and the training of men in camps across the province. Conscription was never introduced in Ireland and as recruitment numbers began to decline recruiting rallies became a feature of life in Ulster.

The role of women was not neglected, and the talk included references to the service of women as professional nurses and Voluntary Aid Detachments, as well as their enrolment into the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps and work in munitions. Women also collected sphagnum moss which was available in Ireland and this was used as a replacement for cotton wool. The war also had an impact on the lives of children with toys and games often becoming war-themed - dolls houses, for instance, became representations of hospital wards.

The work of farmers became more important, especially as an increasing amount of shipping coming to the British Isles was sunk by German submarines. The work of the Belfast shipyards increased and, as the war came to an end, concrete ships were produced in Warrenpoint because they used less steel which was instead required for making weapons.

In the concluding section of the talk, reference was made to how the November 1918 Armistice and the 1919 Peace Day celebrations were marked before thoughts turned to the erection of monuments and memorials and veterans' organisations such as the British Legion were formed.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58a476f218e6a4.47225022</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.livinglegacies1914-18.ac.uk/News/ArchivedNews/2016/June2016/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Entwined Histories</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BEBCA9BE-8EA9-41F1-AB41-E38135AD5404</gtr:id><gtr:impact>These drama workshops and lectures have begun a process of learning amongst GCSE-level pupils which will continue throughout the project

The Somme Centenary Heritage Day was a free community orientated event aimed at all those interested in finding out more about the Battle of the Somme, how it impacted on local people and landscapes at the time, and what it was like on the frontline a hundred years ago.

Members of the public were invited to bring along any WW1 family-related items such as photographs, letters, postcards, diaries or other memorabilia. From Living Legacies, Elaine Reid and David Hardy were on hand using their state-of-the-art digital scanning equipment to help individuals interpret and tell a story of wartime items.

As well as bringing WW1 objects, the researchers also used new technologies to show how different types of trenches were created in the battlefields of France and Belgium. Conor Graham used an Augmented Reality Sandbox to show how trench warfare changed during the war, and how the landscape of the Somme battlefield affected how the battle was fought. Sophie Long, Keith Lilley, Tom Thorpe and Tim Bowman were also there to talk to visitors about the Somme through photographs and maps, including using 'green screen technology', while for those interested in seeing what landscapes were like in WW1, both at home and on the frontline at the Somme, Living Legacies ran a short film at the museum throughout the weekend.

Dr Tim Bowman, from the Gateways WW1 engagement centre, also gave public talks in Helen's Tower on the Clandeboye Estate, site of a WW1 training camp. A booklet about the camp and Clandeboye links to the Somme were set out in a free booklet, written by Keith Lilley, copies of which were available to all museum visitors.

The Somme Centenary Heritage Day was a great success with the Museum reporting higher than average visitor numbers compared to 2015 for July 1st.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58a481fbdd2d96.42135278</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.livinglegacies1914-18.ac.uk/News/ArchivedNews/2016/July2016/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Remembering 1916: The Easter Rising, The Battle of the Somme and Impact on Lowell-A Public Engagement Conference</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1152175F-F725-4739-A9A1-59C732BE2844</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This conference was held at the UMass Lowell Inn &amp;amp; Conference Centre in Lowell, Boston, on the September 7th &amp;amp; 8th.?

William covers the NMNI 1916 Programme and the issues surrounding the legacy of 1916 in contemporary Northern Irish society. William shared some evaluation of the exhibition which is mixed but highlights the ?passions of the memory of 1916 to both the Nationalist and Unionist communities.

 ? express stories about the conflict through drama and theatre.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The formation of the Living Legacies Engagement Centre emerged through shared interests between academics in exploring the contemporary resonances of the First World War. The past is particularly palpable in Northern Ireland, where our centre is situated. In Ireland, the First World War had a complex impact and longstanding effect, still evidenced today by the enduring legacies of the conflict in the histories and identities of Ireland's populations, as well as in its politics and places, both in this offshore part of the UK as well as in the neighbouring Republic of Ireland.

These troubled legacies of the First World War offer interesting opportunities to work with communities in understanding the cultural politics of conflict commemoration and its shaping of transnational identities, subjects we think have contemporary relevance not just for Northern Ireland but for other parts of Europe too, and indeed other parts of the world. For this reason we are using different but complementary areas of research - our five themes - to address the First World War not simply as history but as heritage.

Thinking about heritage focuses attention on the ways the past lives on in the present, in complex ways. This academic interest also provides us with substantive ways of contributing to community-based research projects that are similarly concerned with First World War heritage; whether that heritage is something that is shared, for example through theatre, through landscapes and monuments, and museums; or something kept personal and private, such as family histories and objects, artefacts and memorabilia that we keep as reminders of the First World War and its impacts on previous generations.

What we hope the Living Legacies engagement centre will achieve, during the three years it is funded, is a stronger shared understanding of the First World War and its legacies. We aim to bring disparate communities together through linking projects that share a common interest in the war's continued presence in our lives and our memories. Recording these modern-day community engagements with First World War heritage, during the centenary period, is as important - we think - as researching the war itself, taking both together we can begin to move from a past conflict to a shared future.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A9411BB6-E33D-49EA-9DA5-6FB4FE1031B4</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5462237d49e483.39108697</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Environment,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.livinglegacies1914-18.ac.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>A collection of objects and stories gathered at 2 years' worth of public engagement events across Northern Ireland.</gtr:description><gtr:id>DA867C59-0373-4BFE-A6E0-83A5C7D95B57</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Ulster Museum used the database to curate an exhibition which was in the museum from 2015-2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b032337ce5b6.55116293</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Living Legacies 1914-18 Digital Archive</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://nmni.com/1916</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>a new digital spatial resource created in collaboration with Conor Graham (GIS Unit) and Paul Ell (CDDA), School of Geography, Archaeology and Palaeoecology, Queen's University Belfast through the Living Legacies 1914-18 Public Engagement Centre.</gtr:description><gtr:id>DE25CC24-EFC3-434A-A9A4-AE0736FB2457</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Used for public engagement events.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b032f9ef9ad0.17101171</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Mapping UVF Members from West Belfast in 1913-14 who Served in the Great War</gtr:title><gtr:type>Data analysis technique</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.livinglegacies1914-18.ac.uk/LearningZone/DigitalResources/MappingUVFMembersfromWestBelfastin1913-14whoServedintheGreatWar/</gtr:url></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>Structure from Motion (SfM) is a relatively new and novel 'machine vision' software technique that allows us to quickly capture the 3D geometry of static features, artefacts, scenes and objects at relatively 'low cost' compared to more established survey methods (Terrestrial LiDAR, structured light scanning etc). SfM uses commercially available handheld digital cameras (DSLR) or in some cases small format camera equipped Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (SUAV) to capture hi resolution/high megapixel colour images of the target feature and/or scene.

Overlapping imagery is processed in desktop PC software or in the Cloud to calculate the 'position' of the digital camera in virtual 3D space around the object. Multiple overlapping camera positions are used to create a 'depth map' of the subject that exists in 3D space as a 'sparse point cloud'. A second software run creates a 'dense point cloud' similar in resolution and geometry to laser derived surface geometry. Finally the point cloud is meshed to create a continuous surface and the original colour imagery from the camera photos is 'draped' over the model to aid visualisation.</gtr:description><gtr:id>97DDB7CD-8B19-47D7-963D-CD4C4C1D2F76</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Created images used in an exhibition, supported research and made available to wider public.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b039209c00a4.12632991</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>3D Modelling</gtr:title><gtr:type>Software</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.qub.ac.uk/research-centres/CentreforDataDigitisationandAnalysis/ServicesandOutputs/3DTechnologies/Motion3DScanning/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>088368D4-FCF0-4B0F-BE9A-09663A5D00FB</gtr:id><gtr:title>Remembering 1916: The Easter Rising, the Somme and the Politics of Memory in Ireland</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f3b1814a2955fe278a16195af63a3329"><gtr:id>f3b1814a2955fe278a16195af63a3329</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Grayson R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>ISBN 978-1316509272</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>58c11947c43960.92630231</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2720DE45-9359-4A23-A9A7-DF61CC64BCA1</gtr:id><gtr:title>Artefacts as Agents for Change: Commemoration and Exchange via Material Culture</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Irish Political Studies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/dda09b86013c3f9a9f94a2880ea5e0c5"><gtr:id>dda09b86013c3f9a9f94a2880ea5e0c5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Crooke E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a60c29853f094.48967716</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>09479E8B-BE58-4CBB-8111-F70B84A6F0B0</gtr:id><gtr:title>Memory politics and material culture: Display in the memorial museum</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Memory Studies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/dda09b86013c3f9a9f94a2880ea5e0c5"><gtr:id>dda09b86013c3f9a9f94a2880ea5e0c5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Crooke E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a60c2e6cfdb08.50020185</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/L008343/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>38E9B207-EFC4-4B48-AF70-C67AC5978934</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Drama &amp; theatre studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DCE73056-5E3D-4976-B573-234E5FF4D633</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic &amp; Social History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>2D6754CC-B7DE-45FB-BB9D-CE7AA05892D0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Historical Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>51073B72-B972-4034-A0A1-87A6B0DCD198</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Museum &amp; Gallery Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6BBE419C-DE2B-46C8-8935-A1B633C83A8A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Theatre &amp; History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
