Its discovery triggered academic and wider interest and a vigorous, popular campaign leading to its rescue for study, conservation and display. Over the decade since its excavation, a substantial programme of documentation and research has been undertaken at a dedicated ship centre. With conservation under way, and plans for a new museum to exhibit the ship recently announced, authoritative publication of the ship is timely. The intention is to produce a substantial publication telling the story of the discovery of the ship and its original construction, life, and demise, in a form accessible to a wide audience reflecting the level of interest shown since its discovery. Recording the thousands of timbers and other objects associated with the ship has produced an unparalleled archive of three-dimensional drawings and laser scans, photographs and other digital assets. In parallel with traditional publication, this digital archive will be submitted to the Archaeological Data Service, making it available to all researchers via the internet. 
The ship represents a rare survival of a clinker-built ship of the late medieval period, constructed on the Atlantic seaboard. Over 25m of the original ship was recovered with the dismantled timbers recorded in detail using three-dimensional digital recording technologies providing an unparalleled opportunity to understand arguably the most complex machine in use during the medieval period. Publication brings together the documentation and analysis of the ship itself, and associated assemblages of rigging, rope, leather, textiles, metalwork and other artefacts and environmental material. Given precise dating of the ship's arrival in Newport through dendrochronology, it is possible to place the ship in its particular historical context in the late 15th century.
The innovative use of digital technologies in this archaeological project raises challenges with traditional publication while offering opportunities to exploit new modes of dissemination of research through accessible digital archives. The publication of thousands of ship timbers as two-dimensional drawings and formulaic text descriptions would not be appropriate, or sustainable, and degrade the quality of the three-dimensional record produced during documentation. By including these in an accessible digital archive, researchers can access and interrogate the original data in ways not possible through traditional publication, and digital visualisations such as animations can be viewed to enhance interpretation and dissemination of research findings. As such this project seeks to address the highlight notice digital transformations, exploring how engagement with the digital environment, requires adaptation in the ways we hold, share, and present knowledge and research.
The synthesis of this research represents a sustained collaboration between the University of Wales Trinity Saint David and the Newport Museum and Heritage service. The integrated publication and archive proposed form an essential stage in the development of a new museum where the ship will be reassembled, displayed and interpreted alongside Newport's other collections.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The discovery of the Newport ship generated widespread popular interest and a vociferous local campaign which led to the ship's rescue. This popular interest has been maintained over the decade since the ship was excavated through a variety of approaches. The original Save Our Ship campaign group has evolved into a community-based group, the Friends of the Newport Ship, which supports the project through regular newsletters for its large membership, attendance at public events, arrangement of a winter lecture series, and production of popular publications. Heritage Lottery funding allowed establishment of learning and outreach activities associated with the ship, delivered through the Newport Museum and Heritage Service which continues. Beneficiaries include schoolchildren, volunteers and workplace students. Project team staff organise regular open days at the Newport Ship Centre, and deliver frequent public lectures. Previous AHRC funding has allowed research into the ship's original shape through innovative construction of scale models and associated display at the Newport Ship Centre. Present funded research is exploring how digital models of the ship may be used to communicate research findings to a wide audience through use of new multi-touch interfaces.
The Newport ship project has therefore established a substantial, non-academic audience and strong community support. Newport City Council has recently announced its intention to develop a new museum in Newport to exhibit the reassembled ship and associated collections. Synthesis and interpretation of research undertaken on the ship over the last decade, and it's deposition in an accessible archive will greatly assist in the development of this museum which is now seen as a key driver in urban regeneration of Newport City.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-06-09</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-10</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>95732</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>4000000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>Global</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>EUR</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>Austria</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>de_AT</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Marie Curie Actions Initial Training Network</gtr:description><gtr:end>2018-02-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>FP7-PEOPLE-2013-ITN 607545</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>67B80C3B-6BD0-4C0A-8E9C-039BF7BFC956</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54634b2c01ceb3.28080621</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-02-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Research findings, presently available through peer-reviewed journal articles and a large digital archaeological archive, freely available to all through the Archaeology Data Service, have made the research outcomes of over a decade of research into the Newport Ship available to the nautical archaeology community (including many museums).

More widely, the data and its interpretation as evidence of a 15th century clinker-built, sea-going merchant vessel, probably constructed on the Cantabrian coast of Spain informs wider research into medieval trade, medieval shipbuilding traditions, and associated resource supply (e.g. timber). The later issue of timber supply for shipbuilding in the Iberian peninsula is now being taken forward in a European Commission funded Marie Curie International Training Network &amp;quot;Forest resources for Iberian Empires: Ecology and Globalization in the Age of Discovery&amp;quot;
The methodological developments delivered by this project are having a significant impact on how other ship archaeology projects are being addressed (internationally) with many such projects utilising the digital methods employed and advocated by the Newport Medieval Ship Project</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D042C201-20AA-4CCA-9C98-1D38F94C27D4</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54635940b57bf0.01853248</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/newportship_2013/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The Newport Ship is the most substantial late medieval vessel excavated and recovered in Britain. The ship was discovered during development on the west bank of the River Usk in Newport, South Wales in 2002. More than twenty-three metres of the clinker-built ship were recovered, along with significant artefact and environmental assemblages. Finds point to strong Iberian connections during the active life of the ship, which arrived in Newport, in the Severn Estuary, after the spring of AD 1468. The dismantling and recovery of the ship has enabled detailed recording using innovative 3D digital techniques and approaches to hypothetical reconstruction. This archive makes available this digital data along with digitised versions of site records, post-excavation documentation of the ship and specialist reports and catalogues.</gtr:description><gtr:id>2A2CC7D7-7367-4998-8C9A-182443BA5CF7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Full impact not yet realised as data has only been available for limited time.
