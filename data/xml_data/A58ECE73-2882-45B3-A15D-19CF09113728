Network</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/L014858/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>In the summer of 2012 RCUK, DFID and DECC launched a major research programme (Energy and International Development: Understanding Sustainable Energy Solutions (USES) in Developing Countries Programme) designed to improve our understanding of sustainable energy solutions within developing countries (see RCUK/DFID/DECC, 2012). This USES programme represents a significant research investment within an area that is clearly of increasing importance to the UK government (low carbon energy is a major area of funding of the &amp;pound;2.9 billion International Climate Fund and energy represents a growing component of DFID aid and research funding) but also one that had been identified by RCUK in 2010 as an area of major interest but limited capacity (RCUK, 2010). 

The programme has set itself a series of ambitious objectives. These include: having demonstrable impacts on the lives of the urban and rural poor; improving the evidence base concerning the impacts of low carbon energy transitions on wider aspects of poverty alleviation and development (particularly the cultural and political barriers to access); and developing meaningful collaborations between UK academics and colleagues in Southern institutions, and between those academic communities and the wider community of policymakers, practitioners, businesses and users. 

While each of the projects funded under the programme has been designed with these programme goals in mind, the success of the programme as a whole in achieving the ambitious goals which it set itself would be greatly facilitated by close cooperation and mutual learning amongst the researchers involved. As such, this proposal seeks to establish a research network (the LCEDN USES Programme Network) that will develop a series of integrative activities that can assist the USES programme in achieving its objectives by establishing a strong forum where the researchers involved in these projects can support and learn from each other. Thus, one of the key intentionsof the proposed network will be to integrate the teams working on the 12 funded USES projects. Activities will be designed to address key challenges likely to be common to the projects, both in terms of the conducting of the research itself and in relation to ensuring impact and enhancing capacity building activities. The network will also facilitate the drawing of comparative lessons from across the projects and cross-programme monitoring and evaluation. The Network will also provide significant opportunities to enhance the reach of the impact and dissemination activities of the individual USES projects and to network the projects into the broader national and international communities working on these issues. It will make full use of the existing resources, activities and networks of the UK Low Carbon Energy for Development Network (LCEDN) in ensuring the widest possible research uptake and securing the highest levels of impact for the work conducted via the USES programme research. The LCEDN USES Programme Network will also work to ensure that the UK government's funding of the USES programme contributes towards somewhat wider goals such as raising the profile of UK energy and international development-focused research in the UK (and overseas) and encouraging more UK researchers in the energy sector to think through the international development implications of their work. Finally the network will also play a role in coordinating annual reporting and representation of the 12 USES projects to the programme funders.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The LCEDN USES Programme Network has been designed specifically to enhance the impact of the research funded through the RCUK/DFID/DECC Energy and International Development: Understanding Sustainable Energy Solutions (USES) in Developing Countries Programme. 

Through an innovative programme of face-to-face and electronic interactions and coordinated dissemination activities, the network will integrate the community of researchers (UK and international) involved within the 12 projects that have been funded via the USES programme and their commercial, public and NGO partners. The intention is to strengthen the capacity of each of the projects to deliver real impacts in improving the lives of the urban and rural poor within the countries where the projects are being developed. At the same time, the networking and integration of the projects and the adoption of a shared approach towards project monitoring, evaluation and dissemination will also enhance the ability of the USES programme as a whole to meet its wider objectives of improving the evidence base concerning the impacts of low carbon energy transitions on wider aspects of poverty alleviation and development and developing meaningful collaborations between UK academics and colleagues in Southern institutions, and between those academic communities and the wider community of policymakers, practitioners, businesses and users. This will enhance the effectiveness of the USES programme funders (RCUK, DFID and DECC) expenditure, with clear value for money implications for the UK tax payer.

Beyond the specific impact of the network upon the quality of the research conducted by the 12 USES projects in the locations where they are developed, the network will also deliver real benefits to a range of other stakeholders working within the broader arena of low carbon energy and international development issues. The network will, for example, provide enhanced access to improved understandings of some of the major contextual factors affecting the success of individual projects/investments which will be invaluable for commercial organizations, international and national policymakers and practitioners working in this area. In turn, the network will promote interactions with a range of other UK and international academic communities working in low carbon energy, international development and related fields who will gain from the sharing of experiences regarding the trans-disciplinary collaboration and cross-cultural research involved in the individual projects, as well as the enhancements to the evidence base concerning the impacts of low carbon energy transitions on wider aspects of poverty alleviation and development.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-02-09</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-02-10</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>79530</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Manchester</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>SUPERGEN Bioenergy Hub</gtr:department><gtr:description>Bioenergy SUPERGEN Joint workshop organization</gtr:description><gtr:id>08BEBD52-488E-4300-87F1-3B9381D5A126</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Multi-disciplinary - biology, engineering, geography, anthropology

Paper Title: Resilience, Adaptability and Solidarity: Auto-Ethnographic Reflections on Four Years of Networking Energy for Development 
Abstract: 
This paper focuses on the development and operationalizationof 
a specific type of social innovation: networks. It draws upon the authors' experiences as coordinators of the Low Carbon Energy for Development Network 
(LCEDN) and Wind Empowerment (WE) to offer a comparative analysis of two different organisations, which have the shared goal of facilitating access to sustainable 
energy by providing opportunities for knowledge sharing and collaboration between experts.
As would be expected in the field of international development, the geographical and cultural distances between network partners are large, which presents particular challenges for the establishment and development of a network - the core task has been how to reduce such challenges to the minimum online, whilst not losing nuances and understandings of socio-cultural difference key to making such a network more effective. Thepaper offers auto-ethnographic reflections from the past four years, highlighting the key lessons learned and will be of relevance to those looking to initiate or sustain a network in the field of energy for development, or even development more broadly. 
Resilience (recovering from external shocks, such as unstable funding sources), solidarity (mutual support between members during difficult times) and adaptability 
(evolving with the changing interests of members and broader context) were three cross-cutting themes that were found to be crucial for the sustainability of bothnetworks.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6d6913355c0.53394102</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>USES Network Session at Annual LCEDN Conference in Adinburgh (May 2016)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6D85810A-E55C-4D76-897C-13014FD0D792</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was the LCEDN's 2016 annual event and it included a session devoted to learning from the experiences of the USES projects</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6d76544ff26.16947446</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>4th LCEDN Conference Durham 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3E2068F3-A789-4E7E-BC98-5D067A78D8A4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We held a special USES section at the 4th LCEDN conference held in Durham during March 2015 during which we presented updates on both the READ and SONG projects as well as encouraging discussion across the project teams as well.

Held every three years as a high-level event, the Stakeholder Forum is one of the strategic dialogue events organized by the AEEP. The Milan Forum was jointly organized by the AEEP, the Italian Government, the African Union Commission (AUC) and the European Commission, and focused on how to advance renewable energy innovation, capacity building and investment, under the overall theme 'Business and Science: Leading the Way to Sustainable Energy.'
The Forum brought together more than 500 participants, including African and European Ministers, Commissioners and senior officials from the African Union (AU) and European Union (EU), and other high-level participants representing policy-makers, regional institutions, international organizations, the banking and finance industry, the private sector, academia, civil society, and the media. Discussions during the Forum were held in plenary and in specially structured panels exploring progress towards achieving the AEEP's 2020 Targets. These targets aim to: provide an additional 100 million Africans with access to sustainable energy services; double the number of electricity 
interconnection between African countries, and increase gas consumption and exports in order to enhance energy security; raise the proportion of renewable energy in the energy mix through, amongst others, generating at least 15,500 megawatts (MW)of new hydro, wind and solar power; and increase energy efficiency across all sectors.
The discussions also provided an opportunity to explore the role of energy in countries' implementation of the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on climate change, with a focus on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 7 (affordable and clean energy), 13 (climate action) and 11 (sustainable cities and communities). On the sidelines of the discussions, participants met in targeted networking, business matchmaking and media events, as well as a parallel exhibition and fair showcasing some new technological innovations.
The Forum launched a number of AEEP reports and initiatives, including the Mapping of Initiatives and Programs in Africa Report, the 2016 AEEP Status Report and the Renewable Energy Solutions for Africa (RES4Africa) Initiative. At the conclusion of the two-day event, participants adopted the Milan Communiqu&amp;eacute; and a &amp;quot;Call for Action&amp;quot; in which different stakeholders announced commitments to help develop a comprehensive portfolio of activities to contribute to the AEEP 2020 Targets.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c7beae2355f8.75121499</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.aeep-forum.org/en/outcomes</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>1300000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:department>Department for International Development (DfID)</gtr:department><gtr:description>Partnerships for Skills Development: An LCEDN Programme of Support for DFID's Transforming Energy Access Initiative</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-06-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Government of the UK</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>CB95F138-0979-467C-9AA7-4094F931A093</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c7c6671676a6.41647614</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-12-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>250000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:department>Department for International Development (DfID)</gtr:department><gtr:description>DFID USES Network Extension</gtr:description><gtr:end>2018-03-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Government of the UK</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>2E6AC281-9098-4CC2-A118-3499DBB3CAF5</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dd145fe34c56.22739139</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-09-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>We have received enhanced funding from DFID to continue and deepen our work across the 13 funded projects up to the programme end in 2018.

DFID's 2016 review of the programme sugegsted that the USES Network &amp;quot;has proved invaluable in consolidating progress reporting on the projects, following up on various issues during the year and promoting best practices and dissemination of the research.&amp;quot; The 2017 report suggests that &amp;quot;one of the encouraging features of the programme is keeping projects which have formally concluded involved in the integrative activities led by the USES Network, and consolidating output reporting. This provides scope for continued monitoring, builds momentum for follow-up activities, and joint dissemination.&amp;quot; 
The USES network has also been used to help develop ideas for future DFID research interventions.

The USES Programme Network has greatly facilitated the development of a more integrated community of scholars working in this area and enhanced their integration both across the research teams and beyond. Activities funded through the USES Network have allowed us to address a series of inter-connected issues that have arisen across the 13 projects funded through the programme, as well as a platform for shared dissemination and impact enhancement.
Issues addressed have incorporated:
- Management of complex multi-partner international projects.
- Fair Contracting
- Transdisciplinary working practices
- Stakeholder mapping, impact planning and engagement strategies
- Enhancing working practices across North-South research teams
- broader consultation with the UK research community over forthcoming research initiatives.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our engagement with DFID is providing a series of lessons which will be taken forward in future DFID research programmes (we have already been contracted to play a similar role at a much larger scale for the new &amp;pound;65 million Transforming Energy Access programme.
