So, for example, a written sentence comes to express its content by virtue of certain complex facts involving visible features of the inscription. But a spoken version of the sentence comes to express the very same content by virtue of certain complex facts involving audible properties of the utterance.\n\nWe constantly interact with external representations which represent things in a distinctively sensory way, by showing how things look or sound or ...; just consider pictures, televisual images and many playbacks of audio recordings. Similarly, very many of our inner mental episodes revolve around mental sensory images, which also show us how things look or sound or ...; our memories often involve visual and auditory imagery, for example. Researchers have expended an enormous amount of effort on attempting to understand the nature of the contents which are expressed using language yet, despite their obvious prevalence, they haven't expended nearly the same amount of effort on trying to get clear about the contents of distinctively sensory representations. \n\nIt is natural to suspect that pictures and the rest have something fundamental in common - they are, after all, alike in showing us how things look or sound or ... One might attempt to substantiate that suspicion by looking for resemblances in the ways in which distinctively sensory representations express their contents. (Many psychologists have argued that pictures and visual images express their contents in the same broad sort of way, for example.) This is not the obvious way to proceed, however; on the face of it, there is no single way in which, say, pictures and mental auditory images express their contents.\n\nYet that does not mean that we cannot make sense of the idea that all distinctively sensory representations are crucially similar. For perhaps their similarity derives from the especially sensory nature of their contents, rather than from resemblances in how the representations express their contents. My proposed research involves the elaboration and application of a detailed account of the contents which belong to distinctively sensory representations, an account which fully justifies that last thought. The resulting framework can be used to explain the important properties which are shared by distinctively sensory representations as a whole.\n\nBut the account may also be used to shed light upon the properties of specific groups of distinctively sensory representations. It can help us to understand more fully the representational importance of some of the technical devices which painters employ, for example, and to appreciate better the very basic differences which result from major variations between pictorial styles. The framework also sheds light upon empirical questions concerning mental visual imagery, by showing how many of the pieces of experimental data that have been gathered by psychologists in relation to visualisation can be explained in terms of the optical nature of the contents which belong to mental visual images.\n \nMore broadly, my proposed research provides a range of ideas which illuminate one of the most significant human phenomena - our ability to produce and interpret items that are 'about' things - by clarifying the precise nature of the contents which figure in one of that phenomenon's most widespread manifestations, and by clarifying the relationships between that manifestation of the phenomenon and others, like our use of language. \n \n \n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>My research has the potential eventually to produce impact outside of the philosophical community. For instance, central aspects of the semantic framework which forms the focus of my proposed outputs suggest formal models of the information which pictures contain, and those formal models may well be useful within the context of computer programming, just as the formal models suggested by other semantic theories -- such as, for instance, the standard Kripke semantics for modal logics -- are very useful within computational contexts. I will not be able to develop those parts of my research during the hoped-for period of leave, however; the fundamental ideas behind my approach need to be worked out first, and their utility to a range of major academic debates firmly proven, before their practical applications are pursued.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-06-26</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-09-27</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>59095</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The book arising from this work was published during late 2013; no impacts of the relevant sorts have yet flowed from it.</gtr:description><gtr:id>2A1697DE-7CF7-4E9D-A514-4C21C2F9706D</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>5457a83bc7ffe0.35977657</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Certain representations are bound in a special way to our sensory capacities. Many pictures show things as looking certain ways, for instance, while auditory mental images show things as sounding certain ways. What do all those distinctively sensory representations have in common, and what makes them different from representations of other kinds? I argued that they are alike in having meanings of a certain special type. I employed a host of novel ideas relating to kinds of perceptual states, sensory perspectives, and sensory varieties of meaning to provide a detailed account of the special nature of the contents which belong to distinctively sensory representations. The resulting theory was then used to shed light on a wide range of intellectual issues. Some of the topics addressed in my work related to distinctively sensory representations in general, but many of them concern distinctively sensory representations of more specific kinds. My work contained detailed philosophical examinations of sensory mental imagery and pictures, for instance, and of memory, photography, and analogous nonvisual phenomena.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>My work may have the potential to be useful in all those areas to which the nature of the information expressed by especially sensory representations like pictures is relevant. E.g. they have the potential to be of interest to people working on computer vision and visual search, and to art historians plus all those people outside academia who are interested in and sensitive to the philosophical issues raised by art.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4554511E-8A6A-4143-BF03-56ABD6CC568A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5457a7ed528e98.60143002</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://sites.google.com/site/dominicgregoryphilosophy/Home/research/distinctively-sensory-representations</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AE0DB0EF-F4BF-4BAC-BEB7-295CDAE4A818</gtr:id><gtr:title>Showing, Sensing, and Seeming: Distinctively Sensory Representations and Their Contents</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/0cf85a73bfbd8d37f1ba73ecebe77dab"><gtr:id>0cf85a73bfbd8d37f1ba73ecebe77dab</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gregory, Dominic</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-0-19-965373-7</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>i_74683647633bf68d0e</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/H036857/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>946C0541-464B-43A5-9EE3-65C23360E959</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Philosophy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>613C584A-2828-41FD-B276-95CC04EA3952</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Aesthetics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>143EF6F8-CF59-4D04-9EA7-40D70FC41177</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Philosophy Of Mind</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
