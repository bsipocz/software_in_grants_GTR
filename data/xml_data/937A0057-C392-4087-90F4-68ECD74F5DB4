Through the lens of policy language, this project examines how perceptions of insecurity are created and maintained, and how depictions of enmity foster public acceptance of threat scenarios and security policy agendas.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Specifically, the project investigates the US preoccupation with security threats after the Cold War and how the redefinition of the post-Cold War landscape as dangerous and uncertain has locked the US into perpetuating high-cost security practices - even in times of severe economic crisis.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project employs a novel multidisciplinary mixed-methods research design that helps to link security discourse to policy formulation, political strategy, and security policy consequences.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project casts new light on persistent and timely concerns in international security, such as the extent to which security policy is a reaction to 'objective' changes in the international structure, the role played by policy language in marginalizing political resistance, and how 'speaking' international security differently changes security policy practices.&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project seeks to reframe the way in which policy language in international security is studied and understood in order to raise awareness of the importance of 'speaking' (inter)national security for security policy decisions, such as on the level of military expenditures, strategic planning decisions, and the use of force. The following target audiences are expected to benefit from this:

(1) IS/IR Scholars: The project contributes to scholarship that challenges the mainstream understanding of security policy as unlike other areas of public policymaking, and as largely insulated from societal pressures and parochial interests. In particular through its in-depth empirical investigation of the role of policy language in security policy processes and practices, it will benefit scholars within traditional and critical IR/IS fields engaged in exposing the everyday complexity of security policy. Impact will be achieved through high-profile publications and vigorous knowledge-exchange activities in the international academic community. Timescale: Years 1-3

(2) Wider Academic Community: Through its multidisciplinary mixed-method research design to analysis discourse, the project benefits scholarship that seeks to both move discourse analysis beyond language-centrism and disintegrate existing methodological and disciplinary 'divides' in the social sciences in favour of problem-driven research. Project-impact will be achieved through fostering interdisciplinary knowledge-exchange activities at the University of Warwick, the UK, and beyond. Timescale: Years 1-3. Long-term impact will be achieved through enhancing my methodological skill set aimed at establishing my reputation as a facilitator of interdisciplinary research in IS as a pathway to increase the stakeholder relevance of social research. Timescale: Years 3+

(3) Policy Practitioners and Advisors: Security policy decisions have significant social and financial implications, and depictions of enmity lie at their core. Gaining knowledge of their agenda-setting and consensus-building effects to foster 'enemy addiction' is an important tool for political agents seeking to raise public awareness of the politics of threat construction, for example in debates over limiting the scope of security policy to open up new pathways for policy alternatives. The project will also benefit those engaged in collecting public opinion survey data and aim at limiting framing effects contained in security policy question. Impact will be achieved through yearly policy briefs, the knowledge-transfer activities of the project's Speaking International Security network, and creating knowledge transfer partnerships with US think tanks. I will undergo training in media relations to maximize the effectiveness of communicating project aims and results to end-users. Timescale: Years 1-3+

(4) Journalists: Language is an integral part of conveying information through news media. This project seeks to engage journalists in understanding the importance how both their own and the rhetorical strategies of policy practitioners matter and how they may benefit from social sciences research into the (im)possibility of neutral communication. Impact will be achieved through knowledge-exchange and professional training provided for journalists at the Reuters Institute and the National Union of Journalists. Timescale: Years 2-3+

(5) Wider public: Given the enormous societal implications of security policy decisions, the project aims to maximise its outreach to contribute to expanding participation in the study and practice of security policy for the benefit of a wider range of stakeholders, including secondary school students, women, and the wider public. Impact will be achieved through events held at the University of Warwick, bringing IS to the classroom, active participation in existing widening participation networks, public lectures and utilizing web-centric dissemination channels.

The event was a great success. The teachers reported that it had stimulated students' interest in social sciences, and we will repeat this type of event in January 2015 - hoping to continue the relationship in the future.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>543bbe716fa6c0.01581056</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/pais/research/researchcentres/csgr/sisaw/resources/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014,2015,2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>496</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>travel and subsistence grant to present at the 40th Anniversary BISA Conference in London, 16-19 June 2015.</gtr:description><gtr:end>2015-06-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Review of International Studies</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>not applicable</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>9E64FD68-73DC-4985-A0DF-2AB69D338F6B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d8641c37ec98.75471601</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-06-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>A core aim of the ESRC Future Research Leaders scheme is to foster the award holder's professional development. This was the main focus of project year one. Specifically, I undertook specialist training in two main areas: (1) increasing my methodological skill set, with a focus on research techniques that are compatible with - and foster - interdisciplinary research approaches; and (2) enhancing my public engagement capability to better communicate research findings to non-academic audiences. Courses takenincluded: Cognitive Interviewing, Advanced Process Tracing, Access, NVivo (1-3); ATLAS.ti (1-2); Visual Analysis with qualitative software, media communications, and public engagement, as well as research project management. 
 
A second aim of the project was to collect archival materials on US security policy rhetoric. To do so I have thus far undertaken archival research at 11 of the 13 US presidential libraries across the United States, the National Archives II located in College Park, Maryland, as well as in the British Library London's Newsroom (collection of US newspapers from 1645).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Initially, the findings will be available through my publications.
