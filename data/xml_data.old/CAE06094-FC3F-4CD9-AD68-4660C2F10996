These may be examples of a concept, such as the set of natural numbers being an example of a group, and the numbers 3, 4, and 5 an example of a Pythagorean triple, or supporting or counterexamples to a conjecture, such as 1 and 3 being a counterexample to the conjecture that the sum of two odd integers is odd. The study found that examples are used for different reasons at different points in a conversation, for instance to understand a conjecture, to test it, or extend it.

As an example of example-use in mathematics, consider the following conversation, taken from an online forum for solving a conjecture:

&amp;quot;If the points form a convex polygon, it is easy.'' [Anonymous - July 19, 2011 @ 8:08 pm]

&amp;quot;Yes. Can we do it if there is a single point not on the convex hull of the points?'' [Thomas H - July 19, 2011 @ 8:09 pm]

&amp;quot;Say there are four points: an equilateral triangle, and then one point in the center of the triangle. No three points are collinear. It seems to me that the windmill can not use the center point more than once! As soon as it hits one of the corner points, it will cycle indefinitely through the corners and never return to the center point. I must be missing something here...'' [Jerzy - July 19, 2011 @ 8:17 pm]

&amp;quot;This isn't true - it will alternate between the centre and each vertex of the triangle.'' [Joe - July 19, 2011 @ 8:21 pm]

Here we see people raising simple examples in support of a conjecture, and proposing and discussing other examples as potential problems.

In this project we will build on our investigations into example-use in mathematics, and employ third party model generators, to design and build a system which can interface to online mathematical conversations by:

1. Manually and automatically inducing dialogue rules to determine when in a conversation it would be appropriate to introduce an example.

2. Discovering argument patterns as to what role an example will play at a given point.

3. Manually and automatically inducing sets of axioms as input to the model generator.

4. Selecting useful output examples from the model generator.

5. Adding contextual information to the examples such as whether it is a reply to a previous comment or the reason why this example is of interest at this point.

6. Adding the examples alongside the contextual information into a conversation in a way which is useful to other (human) participants.

This will draw together theories of argumentation, automated reasoning systems, and ethnographical, cognitive and philosophical studies of how people do mathematics. The prototype system will be evaluated by running it on mathematical conversations in real-time, and seeing, by a variety of measures, whether mathematicians regard it as useful, and whether they are prepared to interact directly with it.

Furthermore, over the duration of the project, we will build a new and broad network of potential research users, in order to determine further directions which such inter-disciplinary work may take.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Impact pervades our plans for research: in our first four work-packages we disseminate work via conference talks, publications and contributions to open mathematics fora. Our final work-package, which will run concurrent with the entire project over its eighteen-month period, has impact at its core, via building contacts and engaging with stakeholder bodies.

1. Uniting two fields (Knowledge)

The proposed research is a pilot attempt to merge methods and theories of reasoning from the distinct fields of (i) verification, interactive theorem-proving and automated reasoning, and (ii) argumentation, supported by underlying ethnographic theories of how people do mathematics. The ultimate goal is to take a first step towards a new mixed-initiative mathematics in which multiple parties, both human and machine, collaborate in order to produce novel research mathematics. The project is distinctly interdisciplinary and has an original research idea and methodology underlying it. We will give regular talks to both the Centre for Argument Technology at the University of Dundee, and the Mathematical Reasoning Group at the neighbouring University of Edinburgh. Additionally, we will give talks on the HCI and cultural aspects of the computer-mathematician interactions to the HCI group at the University of Dundee. 

The EPSRC First Grant scheme is an excellent opportunity to invest efforts into proving that the two fields can be combined in a way which is beneficial to each of the two fields.


2. Emphasising the role of examples (Knowledge)

This project will deliver a theory of how and when examples are used in online mathematical conversations, alongside supporting pilot software. The ability to automatically introduce appropriate examples at appropriate points in discourse will have application beyond mathematics -- helping to avoid confirmation bias in intelligence analysis, challenging group-think in focus groups, and lessening the framing effect in decision making. By investigating example-use in our focused area of mathematical conversations, we will lay the foundation for broader applications in the future. 


3. Verification and Correctness (Economy and Society)

The project contributes to the EPSRC growth area of verification and correctness. We will build up a network of industry specialists, with whom we will engage to discuss using our ideas in the development of tools and methods for applying formal, mathematical, methods for specifying, designing and verifying critical software systems.

4. Mathematics education (Economy and Society)

The 2015 Office of Science and Technology Policy factsheet entitled: `Empowering Students and Others through Citizen Science and Crowdsourcing' factsheet states that: &amp;quot;Citizen science and crowdsourcing projects are powerful tools for providing students with skills needed to excel in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM).'' Our theory of example-use in crowdsourced mathematics will be based on ethnographic methods, supported by cognitive and
philosophical theories. By engaging with curriculum developers and experts in computer-aided instruction in mathematics, our work will have practical application to mathematics education, impacting theories in the psychology of education as well as mathematics students directly, via our planned lecture series for PhD mathematics students.

5. Skills development (People)

In terms of new skill development, the project will affect the Centre for Argument Technology, as well as externally-funded Honours, MSc and PhD students, in contributing to a vibrant research environment. It will further allow the PI to reinforce existing collaborations with researchers from other universities in the UK and abroad, as well as building and strengthening new collaborations, thus helping to establish her research career.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>99933</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>001038FA-3E30-4670-91C0-6F15D8CCBBB2</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Argument Web: an Online Ecosystem of Tools, Systems and Services for Argumentation</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Philosophy &amp; Technology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/fd9f283fa254fd167e96328ca8168450"><gtr:id>fd9f283fa254fd167e96328ca8168450</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Reed C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5aa98f1f3bc508.47599850</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>762A8294-EB83-4B0A-A480-BB84465DAA71</gtr:id><gtr:title>Lakatos-style collaborative mathematics through dialectical, structured and abstract argumentation</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Artificial Intelligence</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8810f72c438831d7af2deb84a004c080"><gtr:id>8810f72c438831d7af2deb84a004c080</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pease A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5aa98e7ceff2d5.87136374</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P017320/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
