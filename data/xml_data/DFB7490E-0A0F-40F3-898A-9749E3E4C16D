It consists in a four-way collaboration between the Department of Philosophy at the University of Liverpool, the Department of Theology and Religious Studies at the University of Chester, the Department of Philosophy, Theology and Religious Studies at Liverpool Hope University and faith communities in the North-West of England. Its remit is to open up ways in which each group can benefit from the others and it will achieve this through three initial theoretical workshops, a series of impact events and a final international conference. At stake therefore is the influence faith communities can have on religious research and the impact religious research can have on faith communities, as well as the academy's ability to measure this impact. What is distinctive about this network is the central role philosophy of religion will play. Its aim is to model ways philosophy of religion, theology and the social sciences can interact fruitfully with religious practitioners, so as to promote an inclusive conception of research on religion.

The purpose of this network is therefore a more intimate interrelation between theory and practice in the study of religions and, what is more, an interrelation that does not marginalise the distinctive contribution of philosophy of religion. The renewal of religious reflection in twenty-first century Britain demands a joined-up response from the academy - and philosophy of religion needs to be part of this.

This network draws on preliminary research in the Connected Communities theme: an AHRC Scoping Study, 'Philosophy of Religion and Religious Communities: Defining Beliefs and Symbols' at the University of Liverpool. It also emerges out of events already held in collaboration between the Universities of Liverpool, Chester and Liverpool Hope on the relation between philosophy and religious practice.

The network begins with three academic workshops. Their task is to set in place a general framework for facilitating discussions between practitioners and academics by providing models for impact and its measurement when it comes to research on religion in the humanities. There follows a series of impact workshops which put such models into practice and ensure a voice to religious practitioners in reflecting on the role theory could play in their communities. A final, international conference will be an opportunity to present the conclusions arising out of these workshops.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Questions surrounding impact and the measurement of impact are built into the very purpose of this network. It is devoted to understanding the different mechanisms by which theory is able to shape the language, imaginations and practices of religious communities and vice versa. The models of impact generated from a mapping and typologising process will then be tested and refined by working alongside faith communities in the North-West of England. Religious practitioners will therefore be involved at all levels of the project: in organising events, speaking at them and as delegates. Practitioners will have the space and opportunity to reflect on the relation between theory and religious practice through a participatory and critical engagement with these theories (both from social science and the humanities). In other words, they will participate in extended conversations concerning these issues and have the opportunity to formulate their own responses.

The main group benefiting from the network will, therefore, comprise the stakeholders of faith communities participating in it. Representative practitioners will form part of the steering committee, as well as speak at and attend the workshops and conferences.

The most significant part of the impact narrative resulting from this network will revolve around the impact events themselves. The programme of impact events, 'Theory in Churches, Mosques and Temples', is aimed at foregrounding the role theory and research on religion play in religious practice and day-to-day religious life. The events will therefore use accessible texts in philosophy, theology and religious studies as springboards for group reflection among practitioners on how theory impacts on religious practice.

Further engagement with faith groups and other local communities will be ensured by the project dissemination. The blog will disseminate our investigations in accessible form and will be linked to the University of Liverpool's Philosophy in the City website, Facebook page, Twitter account and mailing list. Linking network dissemination to this already established forum will ensure that members of the local population, who are not necessarily attached to faith communities, will also benefit from the network outcomes.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>22088</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>This network is devoted to understanding the different mechanisms by which theory is able to shape the language, imaginations and practices of religious communities and vice versa. One of the main ways in which these stakeholders benefited from the network was by giving them, during the numerous events held, the space and opportunity to reflect on the relation between theory and religious practice through a participatory and critical engagement with these theories (both from social science and the humanities). In other words, they participated in extended conversations concerning these issues and have the opportunity to formulate their own responses.

Members of local faith communities formed part of the steering committee advising the principal investigator and co-investigator on the organisation of events at regular administrative meetings.

The most significant part of the impact narrative resulting from this network was the impact events themselves. The programme of impact events, 'Theory in Churches, Mosques and Temples', aimed at foregrounding the role theory and research on religion play in religious practice and day-to-day religious life. The events therefore used accessible texts in philosophy, theology and religious studies as springboards for group reflection on how theory impacts on religious practice. There was 10 sessions involving groups of around 10 religious practitioners led by the impact co-ordinator of the network, Katharine Moody.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>D9E93631-5965-466C-A5BA-7E70EC2B0D9B</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d70c321f9c53.46219935</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/K003283/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>946C0541-464B-43A5-9EE3-65C23360E959</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Philosophy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FE33AE51-7085-4BCA-8B2F-66C86B855F25</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Theology, divinity &amp; religion</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>35CC531E-67B1-44F7-83DF-824B0C49CF9E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Contemporary Religion</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>0B726621-12A9-419F-B798-630155FB0A8B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Philosophy Of Religion</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
