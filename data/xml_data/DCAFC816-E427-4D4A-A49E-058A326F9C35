A heart attack is caused by occlusion of one of the coronary arteries by a blood clot. One of the main events in the formation of a clot is platelet activation. The main role of platelets is to gather at sites of vessel damage and initiate repair. Besides their good work, platelets may be too active and make very large clots which block the damaged vessel. Without blood the heart muscle is starved of oxygen and the heart muscle becomes irretrievably damaged. Like red cells that carry oxygen to tissues, also platelets lack a nucleus. All cells in the blood are formed by a stem cell which resides in the marrow of the flat bones, but the parent stem cell of platelets has some very unique features. This unique cell is named megakaryocyte and is the largest cell in the bone marrow and carries more copies of chromosomes than normal cells. A normal cell has 2 sets of 23 chromosomes, one set from mum and another from dad. The megakaryocyte can however carry up to 64 sets of chromosomes and the more chromosomes the bigger the cell. It has been discovered by doctors in London that megakaryocytes in heart attack patients are bigger than in healthy people. This is an intriguing observation which may prompt the development of better and safer drugs in the future. Let me explain!
Platelets, although tiny, do vary in size between individuals and some of us have larger platelets than others. Studies in thousands of patients with heart attacks have shown that patients with larger platelets do less well than those with small platelets. It has been suggested that this is because larger platelets are better in making clots, in other words they are more aggressive when encountering a damaged vessel wall. The key question is whether these large platelets are formed by large megakaryocytes which have a bigger complement of chromosomes.
Several researchers have suggested this to be the case but real proof is lacking. The research outlined in this application wants to investigate this important question. You may wonder why this research if so important was not done earlier. The simple answer is that it was not possible, but several amazing and recent technical breakthroughs in Cambridge and overseas now make the study possible. First we are the leading team in the world who can produce large numbers of megakaryocytes in the laboratory by re-educating cells obtained by a skin biopsy. Second, a new instrument has been developed in Cambridge to read the genetic code cheaply and rapidly. This instrument will be used to read the transcribed genetic code in large and small megakaryocytes to identify genes that are differently used between the two groups of cells. Third, in mice I will test whether platelets formed by large megakaryocytes with more sets of chromosomes are better in making clots that the ones formed by smaller megakaryocytes with fewer sets of chromosomes. We obviously cannot do the latter studies in humans and will therefore use a special mouse, which will not reject human megakaryocytes. To clearly identify the platelets formed by human megakaryocytes in mouse blood we will use a clever trick which stains human platelets green. Finally about 100 heart attack patients will be asked to give a sample of their bone marrow for use as a new treatment and for laboratory tests. The results of the tests will be compared with those obtained from healthy individuals or stable patients with heart disease with the hope of discovery of new markers which can be used in tests to improve the treatment of patients with heart attacks.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>I aim to test the hypothesis that &amp;quot;Platelets generated by MKs of high ploidy are more effective in the formation of thrombus at sites of vascular wall injury than platelets generated by MKs of low ploidy&amp;quot;. I will apply this to the clinical setting of AMI as the upregulation of the MK-platelet system may be one disease process that leads to the development of AMI.
First, I will establish the differences in levels of transcripts and splicoforms between MKs of high and low ploidy status using the power of RNA-seq and replicate a subset of these by quantitative transcript profiling at the single cell level. In order to do this, I will generate mature MKs using forward programming of iPSCs and drive polyploidisation using the recently discovered compound diMF, H-1152P [Wen Q, Cell, 2012]. Next, I will use two different validated mouse models to investigate whether human platelets derived from high ploidy MKs are more functionally active ex vivo and more prothombotic in vivo than those derived from low ploidy MKs. Finally, I will compare the levels and splicoforms of the 'diagnostic transcript set' in bone marrow MKs from AMI patients enrolled to the BAMI clinical trial (Bone marrow stem cells in AMI) and controls: healthy allogeneic bone marrow donors (provided by Prof Ouwehand) and stable coronary disease patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery (provided by Prof Mathur). DNA, plasma, serum and clinical information of all patients and controls will be deposited in the NIHR BioResource, a shared resource between the Biomedical Research Centres and Units in the South East of England.
I aim to identify transcript differences associated with MK ploidy, which are putative novel markers 
of platelet function. If my hypothesis is supported by the outcome of this grant these markers may be used to stratify treatment of AMI patients. Furthermore, research of compounds that reduce polyploidisation will be of interest as novel therapeutic and preventative strategies in AMI.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project has a direct impact on future research and clinical practice, the wider society and the economics of health on an international level.
The EU spends &amp;pound;300 billion/year on cardiovascular disease; 53% of adults in Europe suffer from coronary artery disease, the end result of which is platelet thrombosis. Four times more women suffer from heart disease than breast cancer. Therefore, research into the origins of coronary thrombosis from the novel MK-platelet biology viewpoint will have significant impact on further direction of research and clinical benefit to the patient community. I postulate that an increase in polyploidisation of MKs leads to production of larger, more functionally active platelets and this may have a causal association with the development of AMI. Current therapeutics with antiplatelet agents are generic for all AMI patients and I foresee an era in which these drugs and new ones still to be developed are prescribed with greater precision based on the results of laboratory biomarker tests. If the hypothesis is supported by the outcome of this grant, research of compounds that reduce polyploidisation will be of interest as new therapeutic strategies in AMI. Current research into antiplatelet agents focuses on manipulating molecular interactions in the signaling and amplification cascades that underlie the process of thrombus formation. Therefore this project represents a novel research direction addressing platelet production which has the potential to change the management of AMI entirely. The identification of pathobiologically relevant MK transcripts may also be useful as biomarkers in the acute setting. Furthermore, predictive genetics of high ploidy MKs may denote an individual's cardiovascular risk and lead to preventative strategies. A current EU application models 25% reduction in death in AMI with the use of bone marrow stem cells. It is likely that if we can reduce MK polyploidisation, it may be that similar improvement can be chieved. The wider clinical implication will be in the management of antiplatelet agent 'resistance', stent thrombosis and prevention of acute events in stable coronary disease and thrombotic diseases such as stroke. While drug development may take at least 5-10 years from completion of this project, genetic determinants of risk and biomarkers for use in the clinical setting may be identified by the end of the fellowship and feed in to larger validation studies using resources like UK Biobank and other relevant cohort studies in the UK and overseas. 
If this research leads to development of new therapies for coronary artery disease it has a number of elements of impact on wider society. It will give an improved quality of life and well-being to patients and also the general population if our research leads to preventative intervention as suggested by a large study showing platelet volume to be an independent predictor of AMI development in the healthy population [Klovaite J, J Thromb Haemost, 2011]. It has the potential to reduce the cost of care and hospitalisation of patients with AMI and the complications thereof, reduction in lost working days, long term social cost and improved productivity, thereby having economic benefit. This project has the capacity to change risk scoring systems for cardiovascular disease, drive implementation of new screening policies in certain groups and change therapeutic algorithms. There will therefore be significant impact on policy makers and this will lead to changes in international guidance from for example the European Society of Cardiology and American Heart Association. The development of new therapeutics and preventative strategies may also have a commercial impact through pharmaceutical company drug development.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>215479</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The Gordon Conference on Platelet and Megakaryocyte Biology</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>708EE840-E0D9-4E33-921A-35F0A38FCC2D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presented the following poster at the Gordon Conference for over 150 platelet biologists
