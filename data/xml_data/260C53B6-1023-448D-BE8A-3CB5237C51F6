Our project would enthuse people about the aurora and the related topic of space weather, engaging people with world-class research in these areas being done by the SEP and throughout the rest of the UK. Space weather is classified as a hazard by the Government and the Cabinet Office has said &amp;quot;the main challenge we face is that awareness of the risk [due to space weather] is low&amp;quot;.

The University of Southampton currently has a successful engagement programme centred around a planetarium known as the 'Soton Astrodome'. In the last two years, auroral topics have been added and proven popular with audiences, inspiring us to launch a campaign dedicated to the aurora.

One aspect of engaging the public with aurora is demonstrating the basic scientific principles behind them. In the 19th century, Kristian Birkeland needed to demonstrate his theories on how the aurora were formed, and so he built a planeterrella, or simply 'terrella': an experiment in which artificial aurora can be generated around magnetised spheres in a vacuum chamber. Birkeland's life story is fascinating (multiple biographies have been written of his life) and so a narrative can be formed around his life. This will extend the reach of our engagement by enticing audiences not previously engaged with science.

French scientist Dr Jean Lilensten has successfully built a modernised terrella based on Birkeland's original. Now incorporating two spheres (a modelled star and planet), terrellas have been built according to his plans throughout Europe, with one having been built in the UK. The British terrella was built by Dr Gabby Provan at the University of Leicester using an older version of the plans. Terrellas have been shown to capture the public's interest throughout Europe, and the terrella in Leicester has been used to engage 15000 people with auroral research, also being demonstrated by Dara O'Briain and Brian Cox on Stargazing Live. We intend to utilise the expertise of Dr Lilensten in the construction of the terrella and work with Dr Provan to modify existing engagement resources and create new ones.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-10-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-06-22</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>32593</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Grenoble</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>France, French Republic</gtr:country><gtr:department>Institute for Planetary sciences and Astrophysics Grenoble (IPAG)</gtr:department><gtr:description>Collaboration with Gabby Proven and Jean Lilensten</gtr:description><gtr:id>9ED1EAEA-78B9-435C-B764-07E8C461DFB5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A working planeterrella which has been used in two engagements so far (listed in the engagements section).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58becd25d14c54.91019666-2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Jean Lilensten at IPAG gave us the original plans for the planeterrella, which is his brainchild.

Although we were unable to operate the planeterrella due to technical issues, we successfully engaged both students and teachers at schools by using videos of the planeterrella and explaining what should have been happening. Several students were excited by the prospect of fixing the planeterrella and enthusiastically gave feedback on avenues we could explore to do so, but we also engaged teachers from schools in the region, who were interested in having a demonstration of the planeterrella, as well as the staff at the Winchester Science Centre, who expressed an interest in both having us back at the Centre but also in helping us contact schools for potential demonstrations.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58becbda6b6a57.43783997</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Stargazing Live (Southampton)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DCBFB46E-2B1B-4C67-AE7F-47439AB6B7FB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As part of Southampton's annual Stargazing Live event on 11 January 2017, the planeterrella was launched. I gave a talk on the aurora to kickstart proceedings to approximately 20 people, before directing people to visit the planeterrella, which had been set up in a dedicated room for the evening. Although technical problems meant that we engaged the public with videos of the planeterrella in the first 30 minutes of operation, we fixed the apparatus and were able to engage the public with the planeterrella itself for the rest of the evening. 200 people acquired tickets for the Astrodome tours at the Stargazing Live event, and therefore we estimate that 100 people engaged with the planeterrella during the event. Several members of the public mentioned the talk I gave at the start of the evening and asked questions about the topics I had touched on, and on-the-day evaluation indicated that we had successfully communicated several key points regarding the aurora and related science to the members of the public we spoke to.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58becb3eaea464.24123520</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/P000231/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E4C03353-6311-43F9-9204-CFC2536D2017</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>80</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Atmospheric phys. &amp; chemistry</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C88380A2-9C65-425D-B4FB-4E289FACB800</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Atomic &amp; molecular physics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>66CEB256-1CFB-4A2B-A588-3AC25D4D3FB9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Scattering &amp; Spectroscopy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4CF6D0C3-CF9C-4067-9466-B9FC16647C21</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>80</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Upper Atmos Process &amp; Geospace</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
