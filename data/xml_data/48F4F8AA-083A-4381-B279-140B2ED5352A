One in ten people every year and one in three in their lifetime use, and usually pay out of pocket, for complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in the UK. Research into CAM is growing, especially studies that look at why patients use it and the effectiveness of individual treatments. However, we know surprisingly little about the practitioners of these types of therapy. It is important to understand more about the knowledge and skills that underpin this kind of healthcare, and how practitioners attempt to ensure the safety and quality of their practice, especially because most complementary therapists work independently rather than having established career structures like doctors, nurses or midwives. The researcher will recruit graduates from CAM training courses to explore their careers and professional development. The study will involve interviewing practitioners about their experience, and observing them in their daily working lives to enable real events to spark off detailed discussions about how they deal with the realities of daily practice.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Given the growing importance of CAM both in terms of its increasing use in most industrialized countries, and in terms of its politicisation due to its contested knowledge base, there will be a number of non-academic beneficiaries from the research. These are:

Small businesses and the self-employed in the CAM sector and policy makers and regulators in the business and enterprise field: CAM is a growing sector of SMEs (small and medium enterprises) (Mintel 2007), and given the wider growth in the care industry, this research will offer insights about the key issues facing people making a living in this way. A member of the steering group from the Department of Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform will support the project in terms of policy and business implications.

Educational institutions in the CAM sector: The challenges of maintaining a high quality, safe and financially sustainable practice need to be address by educational institutions. This work will highlight the challenges faced by graduates and inform curricula development.

Policy makers and regulators in the health field: Many changes are underway in the regulation of CAM, and this project will provide insights into the challenges of regulating this diverse group of practices (Gale 2011b). In addition, there is an increasing demand from NHS patients to provide CAM service, but ongoing problems with integration of services, which this project will be able to provide insight to in terms of the governance and professional development of practitioners.

Professionals in the CAM and conventional healthcare sectors: Currently one of the biggest problems is lack of communication between the CAM and conventional sectors, not least because patients often do not tell their doctors about their use of CAM because they are wary of negative responses or do not think it is relevant. The inclusion of a general practitioner and CAM practitioners on the study reference group will guide the best form of dissemination to promote a more constructive relationship.

The Study Reference Group (SRG) will provide a forum for debating these issues in terms of:
the design of the study (questions to ask in the interview, focus of observations) 
the analysis of the data (anonymized data on emerging findings will be shared with the SRG to gain different perspectives)
the dissemination of the findings (identifying appropriate methods of dissemination, developing the timetable for a User Dissemination Event, identifying potential future projects or applications of the research).

The Study Website will provide the means for accessing a wider audience, including those from abroad. The conference the PI is running in May 2011 on the Regulation and Professionalization of CAM is being attended by delegates from Australia, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Canada, Saudi Arabia and India. Many of these countries, in part due to the World Health Organisation declaration on Traditional Medicine (2000) are facing very similar issues in terms of the growing use and provision of CAM.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-07-21</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-03-19</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>79913</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>State University of Campinas</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Brazil, Federative Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>UNICAMP, Brazil</gtr:description><gtr:id>200D58DF-70E8-4E95-B76C-A5D1B612C13B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>- One of Professor Barros and Professor Bahamondes' students has made an application to Science Without Borders, to spend a year with me at the University of Birmingham.

Title: Complementary therapy as a calling? Extending the theory of protean careers through the lens of embodied sociology and in the context of medical sub-cultures
Abstract:
As one part of a multi-method and longitudinal qualitative study on education and careers in complementary therapy (CT), I conducted narrative interviews (Cohen 2006) with osteopaths and homeopaths in the UK. The interviews covered practitioners' expectations of a career in CT; experiences of training; setting up an independent practice; and current experiences of 'making a living' (or not). In this paper, I analyse data from the first and last stages of these narratives.

Deciding to train as a CT, like many health/care occupations, is often assumed to be a highly 'protean' (Hall &amp;amp; Moss 1998; Hall 2004) career choice (a 'calling'), perhaps all the more so because CT sits outside the domain of power, status and financial reward that characterizes medicine. Practitioners' accounts do, to a large extent, reflect this protean orientation; however, additional nuance and explanatory power can be drawn in when an embodied sociological approach is grafted onto this classic theory.

This, then, provides a useful basis on which to make sense of accounts provided once the 'realities' of a career in a marginalized and often (although not always) financially unrewarding occupation are experienced. 'Protean' values, when underpinned by embodied experiences and habits, occupy an experientially troublesome position in relation to these realities. This value-reality dynamic is mediated by socio-economic context and so to further explore the transferability of the concepts I discuss, the paper concludes with a critical reflection on careers in CT in the context of other body work occupations (Wolkowitz 2006, Twigg et al. 2011).

Title: Making a living (or not) as a complementary medicine practitioner: the role of social networks
Abstract:
In the context of a global financial crisis, pressure to reduce healthcare spending and ideological drives (in many centre right-leaning governments, such as the UK's) to shift responsibility for health from the state to individuals, complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has retained a small but enduring position in the overall health system. Little is known about practitioners of CAM - their professional practices, their financial aspirations, their personal ambitions or how they are coping with this period of 'austerity'. I conducted ethnographic interviews and observations with 20 osteopaths and homeopaths in the UK for a study examining the experiences of mid-career graduates from CAM training courses. The research question was: After graduation, how do homeopaths and osteopaths negotiate building a career that is personally and financially sustainable, and continue to develop their professional knowledge and skills? In this paper, I analyse the data that were related to practitioners' social networks. In the absence of established career structures and in the context of a preponderance of independent working in CAM occupations, I describe the extent to which they are able to build a sense of professional community (including seeking referrals and new clients, continuing to develop their professional knowledge and finding like-minded people for emotional support). I analyse the extent to which CAM practitioners can be seen to be participating in a 'community of practice' (CoP), what the characteristics of that CoP are, how it compares to other health-related occupations and what implications this has for the embodied experiences and identities of the practitioners themselves.

I produced a worksheet, based on the findings of the study, that could be incorporated into undergradute teaching and learning activities, as well as used in mentoring relationships.

- Individual practitioners - The dissemination event (funded by the study) was attended by a range of practitioners from CAM professions. They reported (in written feedback) that they found the event to be very useful to stimulate reflection on their own practice, and particularly their aspirations and professional identity. Since the completion of the project, I have also presented at a Regional Research Network (CAMBRA) on the findings from the study, which was attended by a range of practitioners from different conventional and CAM healthcare professions. The presentation was followed up by time to discuss and answer questions. 

- Profession in general - I have worked particularly with the osteopathy profession to explore the implications of my research for regulation (including the development of advanced practice structures) and professional organisations (through increasing support for new graduates). I was invited to present at a national osteopathy conference (Institute of Osteopathy Convention) about a follow-on project (see Further Funding) focusing specifically on the role of mentoring in supporting new graduates in their transition to practice.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>33BDF257-5653-4161-A84E-E601D85C4E73</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5440e915b30bd2.58621908</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This research study set out to understand how osteopaths and homeopaths were able to build a personally and financially sustainable career as a health practitioner. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) retains a small but enduring position in most healthcare systems. Researchers have looked in depth at why patients choose CAM, but much less is known about the practitioners of CAM, such as their aspirations and their experiences. In the absence of the established careers paths that are seen in other healthcare professions (like nursing, midwifery or medicine), the study sought to understand how new graduates managed the transition to practice, built their professional networks and were able to build a successful practice. The research used an innovative multi-method approach using narrative interviews and observations of clinical practice then reflective interviews 12 months later to discuss emerging findings.
The main three findings were:
1) The need to acknowledge that there is a transition phase
Many graduates assumed that the biggest hurdle was getting their qualification to practice and that once they had it they would be able to build a busy practice. However, they found that in reality, there was a lot more to learn and that it could take many months or years to achieve the idea of a 'successful' practice they had hoped for. The biggest challenge in this phase was to understand that being in practice is also about building a business. Most graduates felt well prepared from their education for the technical and communicative aspects of practice (i.e. what happen in the consultation room), but poorly prepared for the business aspects (i.e. what happens outside the consultation room). 
2) There are tensions in professional identity that have an impact on the transition
Many CAM practitioners consider their career as vocational and there are tensions around their working conditions. On the one hand, as independent private practitioners in a capitalist society, they are required to be entrepreneurial in their approach and embrace the business side of practice, but many have chosen their career to 'opt out' of conventional employment arrangements so sometimes they experience ambivalence about having to make money as a private practitioner within a capitalist economy. 
3) Graduates need to get support and participate in communities of practice
Being an independent practitioner can be isolating, so practitioners found that seeking support is vital to building a personally and financially sustainable practice. New graduates who were successful in building their practice found support in a variety of ways. They often got practical and emotional support from friends and family. They got support for developing their knowledge from professional groups - both online and in person - or from discussions with and observation of close working colleagues. Crucially, they received support from just a few 'like-minded' people who enabled them to think critically and reflectively about their practice. Although some described their practice as inherently isolating because of working alone, some described ways in which they were able to participate in communities of practice, both at a local level through multi-therapy clinics or peer mentoring groups, or at a profession-wide level through professional associations and journals.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Academic: This research has collected previously undocumented empirical data on: the reasons that practitioners chose their careers, their expectations, their training experience, their transition to practice and their experiences of being established practitioners. In the field of the sociology of health and illness, the research makes original theoretical links to theories of social networks, and explores the extent to which CAM practitioners are able to develop communities of practice (CoPs). CoPs have been closely linked with questions of the quality and safety of healthcare practice so there is much potential for future work in this area. In the field of the sociology of work and employment, the research makes theoretical links to the concepts and techniques of entrepreneurialism explaining why these are such a source of tension for CAM practitioners. I have also published recommendations about the future of sociological research on CAM (Gale 2014, see publications).
In addition to these contributions to sociological research, I've made interdisciplinary connections too and am publishing an international and interdisciplinary book (Gale, McHale 2015, see publications). The primary argument of the book was that the current popular and policy debates are 'stuck' in a polarized and largely asocial discourse, and that an interdisciplinary social science (law, sociology, history, ethics) perspective seeking to introduce nuance and theorize diversity in the field, provides a much more robust interdisciplinary evidence base for policy and practice in the field.
Non-academic: This work has been undertaken in collaboration with professional and patient representatives from the CAM community. This has ensured that changes have been made during the lifetime of the project to the curriculum of collaborating educational institutions (homeopathy and osteopathy), to the practice of individual practitioners (in a range of CAM therapies) and at the profession-wide level (in osteopathy). As I indicated I would do in my original application, I have prepared a briefing paper (reporting the research in lay terms and with a 'summary and key findings' section at the beginning) and sent it to key stakeholders. Electronic copies of this briefing paper are to be made available online and circulated more widely. A feedback form has been sent to each stakeholder requesting their views on how useful it is and whether they foresee it changing their policies or practice (as relevant). The findings from this will be reported in the 12 month narrative impact report.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>DD7D05A3-7A67-493B-98D8-DD277C17B48F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5422f1060ef4d6.39366836</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Healthcare,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Advice to the homeopathic profession on development of research</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B5A9F19D-99E6-4BDA-A23A-932034291AFA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I have met with and advised the Chief Executive of the Homeopathic Research Institute (https://www.hri-research.org/) about developing their research profile and particular with reference to professional development and training (rather than their clinical research which is their current focus).

It has been cited in a professional journal as one of two key pieces of research that has addressed the issues of osteopaths' challenges in the transition from training to practice. I was then part of a team successful in winning a small grant to develop a mentoring programme for early career osteopaths. I presented on behalf of the team to a national conference of osteopaths (http://www.osteopathy.org/the-io/convention-2015/2014-convention/) about the project. We then launched a consultation survey, which was completed by 215 UK osteopaths. Comments included: 'Exciting and needed development in the profession'; 'There is definitely a need for further support'; as well as some challenging ones that suggested concerns of osteopaths, particularly in relations to concerns about increased 'bureaucracy' and that mentoring should remain 'informal'. In addition, there was concern that the proposed project would only apply to early career osteopaths, as some felt mentoring support was needed throughout the osteopath's career. The results of this, and a literature review, are currently being used to develop a mentoring structure. The impact of this is to better support newly qualified osteopaths (particularly to develop their communication and entrepreneurial skills) in 'real-life' practice, to be able to make a living from their vocation and to improve patient-centred care.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>55acc8969be433.60630280</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Membership of a guideline committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D5ADC35C-4F52-423E-B19D-CDA9F746B49B</gtr:id><gtr:title>How can you make a career as a complementary therapist?</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5aefb4150ef77d8715eb6ead4f645d73"><gtr:id>5aefb4150ef77d8715eb6ead4f645d73</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gale, NK</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545917a42ba355.44690415</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8DC7D473-FDD1-4F12-9071-46C6B941261C</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Sociology of Traditional, Complementary and Alternative Medicine.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Sociology compass</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5d4543e0d29fafe1b00a225e30151e92"><gtr:id>5d4543e0d29fafe1b00a225e30151e92</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gale N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1751-9020</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>541ac7f59ef585.75164512</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3888B7B7-8570-46B0-81A1-288903BF6750</gtr:id><gtr:title>Towards a learning profession?
