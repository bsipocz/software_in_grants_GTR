In response to evidence of pollinator declines in Europe , pollinator conservation strategies have been developed in the private, public and third sectors. We have identified over 50 different interventions that could help conserve pollinators, from restricting certain pesticides to protecting grassland. The science needed to decide which are the most beneficial, or cost-effective, is rapidly developing, particularly within projects funded through the Insect Pollinators Initiative (IPI). Groups investing in pollinator conservation, including some high profile food retailers, are very keen to base their efforts on the best available evidence. This KE Fellow will develop strong long-term links between researchers and end-users, at a time when new knowledge is emerging and rapid action is critical.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>68248</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Sainsbury plc</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Sainsbury's workshop on biodiversity</gtr:description><gtr:id>5E6DD1E9-E693-4152-B36A-4C85E43AC428</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Sainsbury's are in the process of developing a new biodiversity strategy, informed by the outcomes from the workshop.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5462580f5ecc59.80742546-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Sainsbury's fresh produce team provided the venue, the catering and invited all the delegates to the workshop.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>A one-day workshop hosted by Sainsbury's and delivered by the University of Cambridge in May 2014.

This policy is innovative and ground-breaking. Its strong link to ecological research has already generated interest from the Agricultural European Innovation Partnership EIP-AGRI (http://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en).

The activities of this Fellowship increased recognition of the value of Knowledge Exchange Fellows by Government (Defra), as demonstrated by appointment to the Pollinators Advisory Steering Group, and the inclusion of knowledge exchange as a key policy action in the National Pollinators Strategy.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>B76171E7-74A9-4DC8-B8ED-EB3F4014499D</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>569f824eab77c1.77560324</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This knowledge exchange project is about making the best use of scientific knowledge for conservation of wild insect pollinators. We have set up a Pollinator Conservation Delivery Group, which brings together scientists working on insect pollinators with a whole range of organisations actively involved in pollinator conservation. The group has over 40 member organisations, including businesses such as Waitrose, Neal's Yard and the Cooperative, campaigning charities such as Buglife and Friends of the Earth and government bodies such as Natural England.



The Pollinator Conservation Delivery group met twice. At the first meeting in May 2012, members identified what we still need to know to conserve wild insect pollinators. Basic pollinator ecology, economic benefits of crop pollination and impacts of pesticides emerged strongly as priorities. At the second meeting in September 2012, the Group developed 12 specific projects to start addressing these priority knowledge needs. 



The projects are all collaborative. Insect pollinator scientists are working directly with businesses, NGOs and government to design, fund and implement new pieces of work. One example is the development of an evidence-based package of agri-environment scheme options to support beneficial insects (pollinators and natural enemies). This is the subject of a current project under a different grant (NE/KO15419/1).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The priority knowledge needs and projects identified by the Pollinator Conservation Delivery Group are useful to researchers and policy makers as a clear identification of knowledge gaps.
The Pollinator Conservation Delivery Group itself was a source of useful contacts for the scientists and end users who took part.

The signatories are Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Peru, Slovenia, Spain, the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Uruguay. Two of these countries already have national pollinator strategies (UK, France), through which many actions are being promoted and encouraged that improve conditions for wild and managed pollinators in farmed and urban areas. The other 11 countries are interested and/or actively developing national pollinator strategies and this declaration will help them learn from each other, and help shape the strategies.

The text of the document, provided in this website http://promotepollinators.org/ includes a list of &amp;quot;essentials for national pollinator strategies&amp;quot; which very strongly draw on the ten policies for pollinators suggested by Dicks et al. (2016).

Lynn Dicks (the grant holder) was an invited speaker at the first two events, held in London on Monday 11th February 2013, and at Osterley Park, Middlesex, on 18 June 2104. She presented an approach to devising an evidence-based agri-environment package for beneficial insects, a project proposed and supported by the Pollinator Conservation Delivery Group funded by a Knowledge Exchange grant (NE/J500665/1), and being carried out under another grant (NE/K015419/1). At a third workshop, held at the RSPB, Sandy, Bedfordshire, on 5 September 2014, Lynn Dicks was one of only two academic researchers present.

These workshops were organised by Natural England staff directly involved in designing new agri-environment scheme options and packages, for implementation as part of the reformed Common Agricultural Policy for 2015. The discussions and presentations directly informed the design of the new schemes. 

The Countryside Stewardship Wild Pollinator and Farm Wildlife Package was publicly launched on 4th November 2014 as part of the National Pollinator Strategy for England. It is specifically designed to support pollinators, wild birds and rare arable plants, and will be supported by an additional &amp;pound;350,000 from Defra.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-2008391601.97264676253939c</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Membership of a guidance committee</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/370199/pb14221-national-pollinator-strategy.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Environmental Audit Committee Inquiry: Insects and Insecticides</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F9541D47-0D4C-43D5-9EBC-EB43F8AB1C4D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This evidence is published in an Environmental Audit Committee report submitted to Defra on 5 April 2013. The report recommends that Defra introduces a national pollinator monitoring programme, revises its Action Plan for the Sustainable Use of Pesticides, introduces a range of sentinel pollinator species in UK pesticide risk assessments and supports a proposal by the EU to ban use of three neonicotinoid pesticides in January 2014. One of these actions (developing a national pollinator monitoring scheme) was taken forward in the National Pollinator Strategy for England launched in November 2014, although the action is a research project to scope and cost and monitoring programme, rather than a commitment to resource one.

The most prominent contributions from the grant holder (Lynn Dicks) were to describe the state of existing scientific knowledge on wild pollinator declines, to explain why different groups of wild pollinators experience different risks from pesticides and to speculate on what evidence would be required to generate certainty on the impact of pesticides on wild pollinator populations. My evidence is directly quoted seven times in the main text of the report. The impact of this activity is a greater awareness about the status of wild pollinators in Government.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-2401648575.81411366255a966</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/environmental-audit-committee/inquiries/parliament-2010/insects-and-insecticides/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D5FFF2B0-B49B-4255-8315-C892EE94F4BA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Bees, lies and evidence-based policy.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nature</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/960aaad0e9aaabe90488f50ce95b53f4"><gtr:id>960aaad0e9aaabe90488f50ce95b53f4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dicks L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0028-0836</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d0250250cb268f</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D0BD7F60-3446-4E60-AC1D-634ACCF425EA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Solution Scanning as a Key Policy Tool: Identifying Management Interventions to Help Maintain and Enhance Regulating Ecosystem Services</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Ecology and Society</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a97d33d7e5490239775412edf5fba553"><gtr:id>a97d33d7e5490239775412edf5fba553</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Sutherland W</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5461fa7382b0e4.47901805</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AB75DCF9-BD0E-4D31-BE37-8BD0402C94F3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Ecosystem service valuations of mangrove ecosystems to inform decision making and future valuation exercises.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>PloS one</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a0f5448c554d35d6e077a8a7c47170c5"><gtr:id>a0f5448c554d35d6e077a8a7c47170c5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mukherjee N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1932-6203</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5461fa73d9e712.84009137</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AB8EAC3C-BBEC-4659-8C41-E93C1E11FB8F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Identifying key knowledge needs for evidence-based conservation of wild insect pollinators: a collaborative cross-sectoral exercise</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Insect Conservation and Diversity</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/960aaad0e9aaabe90488f50ce95b53f4"><gtr:id>960aaad0e9aaabe90488f50ce95b53f4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dicks L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d06b06b57976cc</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/J500665/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
