Most people are familiar with reactions occurring when a molecule is heated up (e.g. cooking), but different reactions are possible using UV-light (photochemistry) and sunburn is an unfortunate consequence of this. We plan to use the unique reactivity of photochemistry, safely confined in a lightbox, to synthesize new functional molecules and will control the synthesis of these photochemical reactions by adding a small amount of a chiral catalyst to the reaction mixture. This chiral catalyst will allow us to selectively synthesize either right- or left-handed products, i.e. mirror images of each other, simply by changing the catalyst. The controlled synthesis of these handed-molecules is vital for our health and well-being since the enzymes and proteins in our body and pathogens, such as bacteria and viruses, selectively react to these chiral molecules. These new molecules that we make could become the drugs and pesticides of the future. 

ACP is a multi-disciplinary approach to address deficits in current chiral photochemical methodology and will develop a repeatable and scalable technology platform for further investigations. The ACP concept is particularly 'green' as it requires only small amounts of a chiral catalyst for control and uses UV-light to perform the reaction. This research will be highly significant to both academia and industry as it offers a general approach for the asymmetric synthesis of new functional chiral molecules. This proposal addresses a highly important and challenging concept within organic synthesis and will find immediate applications across synthetic chemistry.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This proposal will develop a new general approach to Asymmetric Catalytic Photochemistry (ACP). The synthesis of novel chiral molecules is of huge importance to the world as many of our most important and effective drugs possess a chiral centre. The development of a new general method for the asymmetric synthesis of these valuable molecules is therefore very important for our future health and prosperity. The main beneficiaries of this proposed research will be:

(i) Academic researchers who work in the fields of flow chemistry / continuous processing, catalysis, photochemistry and asymmetric synthesis for the synthesis of high-value chemical entities. This general approach to ACP will provide opportunities for experts in these individual fields to collaborate together for the synthesis of novel chiral molecules of societal benefit. Academics will use this concept to synthesize new molecules that will be of interest to biochemists, material scientists and physicists, thereby making an impact across these diverse fields too.

(ii) Commercial entities who synthesize high-value chemical entities, particularly those working in the pharmaceutical and fine chemical industries, will have a new enabling technology for the synthesis of new chiral molecules. Due to the continuous, 'green' (only UV-light) and orthogonal nature of ACP, existing synthetic routes to drugs could be replaced thereby saving money, reducing pollution, and providing opportunities to generate new intellectual property (IP). The adoption of ACP is expected to make important innovations in the field of asymmetric phase-catalysts and reaction engineering (and the associated IP), which will lead to the formation of spin-out companies for the production of both these valuable chemicals and for the construction of new systems. Furthermore, the popularization of the phase-separated reactor platform will require the commercial construction of this system for installation in both small laboratories and into pilot plants and for the manufacture of these valuable chiral molecules.

(iii) The development of the new synthetic routes to drugs, as outlined in (ii) will reduce the price of these medicines thus benefiting the patient and the healthcare system. Additionally, a previously unviable manufacturing route could be resurrected, thereby bringing an expensive or unavailable medicine directly to market and thus aiding the well-being of the patient. Finally, the new chiral scaffolds made using ACP are expected to be biologically active, hence, in 10-20 years new biological probes or drugs could be created using ACP techniques thereby having a significant impact on long-term health policy.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>99389</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R014833/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64596636-AE88-4F6E-A816-9C4C203E1197</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Catalysis &amp; surfaces</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>60EBB420-734E-4DB5-B0F2-65A1115A27F8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical synthesis</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>41B6965D-D659-4099-9434-7C61B7E5BEF2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Asymmetric Chemistry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>35E9CECD-F211-4914-9F91-4B8FB76B773D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Catalysis &amp; Applied Catalysis</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
