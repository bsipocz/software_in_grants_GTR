In other words, to understand how criminal individuals or organisations profit from formal industry, either through deliberate processes of human trafficking or by the exploitation of already vulnerable workers. Key questions include: What factors create 'demand' for forced labour within supply chains? What are the pathways that allow forced labour access to formal industry? How do perpetrators of corruption and illegality escape detection by the authorities, and by the retail companies 'leading' these supply chains? The new and important evidence base generated through this project will contribute to ongoing academic and policy debates on the causes of, and solutions to, forced labour in global commodity production. 

The research questions will be investigated through a range of qualitative methods including elite interviews with key informants and ethnographic field research among workers themselves. Supply chain analysis will be used to understand the firm-to-firm dynamics of forced labour along each of the five stages of the supply chain (raw material, component, manufacture, distribution and retail). The research will focus on cocoa and tea sectors dominated by UK retail companies; both sectors have widespread reports of forced labour, high levels of subcontracting, and industry-led anti-slavery initiatives. While there are media reports and anecdotal evidence to suggest that forced labour is thriving in the cocoa and tea industries, to date, there is no robust research on the business models that give rise to it. 

The project will provide high impact, multidisciplinary research for a wide-ranging audience, including government, civil society, and business organisations seeking to combat human trafficking, forced labour, and modern slavery. It will produce recommendations for how recent 'Anti-Slavery' legislation can be enhanced to combat the global business of forced labour. It will also provide recommendations and 'best practices' to strengthen existing business strategies for detecting and preventing forced labour within global operations. The research findings will be disseminated widely to the public, through online newspaper articles and regular media output (high quality press and radio). This will allow the specific academic themes of the project to be translated into broader topics for debate and discussion.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>I am conducting this research to fill an information and policy gap around the business demand for forced labour. From the outset, this project has been designed in collaboration with non-academic users. On May 12, 2014, I convened a focus group of 30 policymakers and civil society representatives at the University of Sheffield (UoS) to co-design the project's aims, objectives, and methodology. The project has been expressly designed to directly benefit these groups, as well as others actively involved in formulating and promoting initiatives to address forced labour and modern slavery in the UK and globally, including: a. Businesses seeking to combat forced labour in their supply chains; b. Local and national governments attempting to eradicate forced labour; c. International organisations dedicated to raising labour standards; d. Societies vulnerable to forced labour in the UK and the rest of the world. 

Impact among three groups will be especially significant, and will be achieved in distinctive and innovative ways:
1. Policy actors. Building on my successful track record of parliamentary engagement with the UK's Draft Modern Slavery Bill, I will collaborate with existing contacts within the Parliamentary Group on Human Trafficking and Modern Slavery to launch the project Report in Parliament. Project advisory board member Matthew Hamlyn (House of Commons) has committed support. The Report will include recommendations for how current UK Anti-Slavery legislation can be enhanced to combat the global business of forced labour, ensuring traction among policy makers. As a result of this research, government agencies will gain knowledge about business drivers and underlying forces which will enhance the efficacy of future public policy. 

2. Businesses. In order to ensure impact among businesses, I will: hold an industry-representative focus group in London; produce an industry brief with recommendations and 'best practices' for companies seeking to detect or prevent forced labour within their global operations; present findings at the Retail Industry Leaders Association conference. As a result of this research, UK-based businesses will be able to more effectively predict where and how forced labour might manifest in their supply chains. It will catalyse efforts to modify social auditing practices to focus on portions of the supply chain where forced labour is most likely to occur, and thus contribute to global economic performance. The involvement of Rosey Hurst, Director of the ethical audit firm Impactt, as an advisory board member will help ensure traction among industry. 

3. International organisations. The involvement of the ILO, a Nobel Peace Prize-winning United Nations agency dealing with labour issues, as a research and dissemination partner will foster impact among organisations dedicated to raising labour standards in the global economy. Through participation in the project advisory group and dissemination workshops, civil society representatives will co-create knowledge about the measures required to adequately protect victims of forced labour. In addition, by generating new knowledge about the limits of current governance initiatives, this project will facilitate knowledge-driven NGO engagement with policy makers and the public. 

In order to achieve these aims, I will mobilize the networks of two UoS research institutes-the Crick Centre for the Public Understanding of Politics and the Sheffield Political Economy Research Institute-to which I am affiliated. I also have support from three mentors at the UoS-Professors Nicola Phillips, Andrew Geddes, and Jason Heyes-as well as two outside mentors: Professor David Spatz (Yale University) and Dr. Jean-Marie Kagabo (ILO). Finally, an international mixed practitioner and academic advisory board comprised of leading academics as well as representatives of industry, House of Commons, and the ILO will help ensure the research achieves traction and participation.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>220347</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>International Labour Organization (ILO)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Switzerland, Swiss Confederation</gtr:country><gtr:description>International Labour Organization</gtr:description><gtr:id>6E23290B-941D-4D8D-835F-12C68E3DEB96</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Yes, this collaboration is multi-disciplinary.

The project has been expressly designed to directly benefit these groups, as well as others actively involved in formulating and promoting initiatives to address forced labour and modern slavery in the UK and globally, including: a. Businesses seeking to combat forced labour in their supply chains; b. Local and national governments attempting to eradicate forced labour; c. International organisations dedicated to raising labour standards; d. Societies vulnerable to forced labour in the UK and the rest of the world. I am in regular contact with all four sets of stakeholders, and they have played a critical role in co-designing my research. At this point in the project (roughly 8 months into a 3 year project), we are collecting data and thus the findings are unknown, however, I have already begun to facilitate public debate on the issue of governing slavery in global supply chains. 

In September 2016, I convened and edited a written debate on openDemocracy.net entitled, 'Can Corporations be Trusted to Tackle Slavery in Supply Chains?' That debate brought together nine movers and shakers in the field of labour policy (including several advisors to my project) to discuss the best strategy for combating labour abuses in global supply chains. I asked respondents to reflect on whether we should continue with 'corporate social responsibility', or favour an alternative of international legal liability and accountability. Respondents included: Anannya Bhattacharjee (Garment &amp;amp; Allied Workers' Union); Urmila Bhoola (UN Special Rapporteur on Contemporary Forms of Slavery); Cathy Feingold (AFL-CIO); Hugh Helferty (Queen's School of Business); Houtan Homayounpour (International Labour Organisation); Ed Potter (Formerly of the Coca-Cola Company); Anna de Courcy Wheeler (The Freedom Fund); Lara White (International Organisation for Migration); Leonardo Sakamoto (National Commission for the Eradication of Slave Labour). The debate was published in collaboration with one of the project's impact and dissemination partners, Yale University's Gilder Lehrman Center for the Study of Slavery, Resistance, and Abolition and attracted widespread attention within the media, from policymakers, and NGOs and activists. The introductory article to the debate, which I co-authored with Joel Quirk, &amp;quot;Introducing the terms of debate: regulation and responsibility in global supply chains&amp;quot; has been read over 25,000 times.

I will continue to collaborate with stakeholders on my research and build connections with impact partners, to ensure that once the data collection and analysis is complete, the findings will have pathways for impact. I will also continue to build public debate about the core governance issues raised by my project.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>4A72EF7E-E5B1-4C80-8B4C-6205ACDC553F</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>58c57b5ba91245.95440043</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice,Retail</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Not applicable this year.

The research design underpinning this database combines multiple qualitative methods to shed light into associated research questions, as well as triangulation methods to consolidate and validate research findings. This database is designed to build a fine-grained understanding of how forced labour operates in the tea and cocoa sectors, focusing on sites in India and Ghana. It sheds light into research questions 1-3: 1. Where, why, and how does forced labour manifest in legitimate industry?; 2. What cost structures, revenue streams, and resources characterise the business models of forced labour deployed within chocolate and tea commodity chains?; 3. Who are the perpetrators of forced labour within the cocoa and tea industries and what is the modus operandi of these individuals/organizations?. This database has five key components: a) Pilot studies in India and Ghana; b) Survey and ethnographic research among workers in India; c) Survey and ethnographic research among workers in Ghana; d) Elite interviews in India; and e) Elite interviews in Ghana. Data collection is currently in progress. The pilot studies in India and Ghana are complete. They survey (N=1000) and ethnographic research in India and Ghana are underway. The interviews are also under way, with 45 of 120 complete, and transcription underway. A coding framework is in place.</gtr:description><gtr:id>4F396084-FDEF-472D-B53B-7DA71934689C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Database is still in progress.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c2cbc929e005.38579270</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Interviews and survey with tea and cocoa workers</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7A3B69A6-0CAA-4098-8DB4-DC74E1D41FCD</gtr:id><gtr:title>Introducing the terms of debate: regulation and responsibility in global supply chains</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/84ebc84d0466a55cdf6ea089787c1299"><gtr:id>84ebc84d0466a55cdf6ea089787c1299</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>G LeBaron</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c5805aefae07.33118233</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>27E9D820-B86C-4CDD-A58D-8736659B6AB9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Steering CSR Through Home State Regulation: A Comparison of the Impact of the UK Bribery Act and Modern Slavery Act on Global Supply Chain Governance</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Global Policy</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4cc1df1c73c55c705fcf3ebd02391241"><gtr:id>4cc1df1c73c55c705fcf3ebd02391241</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>LeBaron G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>592d6064db9108.44550433</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>523028B6-575A-4DCC-A2A0-BB39C4974941</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Palgrave Handbook of International Development</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4cc1df1c73c55c705fcf3ebd02391241"><gtr:id>4cc1df1c73c55c705fcf3ebd02391241</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>LeBaron G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-137-42723-6</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>57b5a09ad474f4.85701843</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2296B59E-EC94-41B5-971B-6480C4ED751A</gtr:id><gtr:title>When It Comes to Forced Labor, Transparency is Mandatory, but Disclosure is Discretionary</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/84ebc84d0466a55cdf6ea089787c1299"><gtr:id>84ebc84d0466a55cdf6ea089787c1299</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>G LeBaron</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c2b444645874.22503838</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F2160B6A-9C65-4923-ACB2-53B4EF0CD194</gtr:id><gtr:title>Mapping and Measuring the Effectiveness of Labour-related Disclosure Requirements for Global Supply Chains.</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/647f9ab0c8bf80449a8d4359e23ce7ff"><gtr:id>647f9ab0c8bf80449a8d4359e23ce7ff</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Phillips N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c2b33881d564.69787617</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3F38783C-E538-404A-81E0-7AACB369B40C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Oxford Dictionary of Politics, 4th Edition.
