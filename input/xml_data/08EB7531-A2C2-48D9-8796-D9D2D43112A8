I teach in a school for girls with learning disabilities. Many are interested in a range of science topics including astronomy and space science but they underachieve significantly when comparisons are made using national data for mainstream students. At present in the school all pupils in KS4 work towards an entry level qualification in science with about 50% also working towards GCSE. From the 2012/13 cohort of 24 girls, 96% passed OCR entry level science with 54% also passing GCSE with lower grades (E to G). No students have gone on to study science or engineering relating subjects on leaving school over the past 10 years. Given these lower grades this is perhaps not surprising but unfortunately there is a culture within the school that perpetuates the belief that careers in health and beauty, catering and childcare are the main ways forward for the students. From those who have left school to move on to vocational college courses in the past three years 52% followed courses associated with these sectors. Not only does this situation limit the girls' career aspirations, it also impacts on their ability to engage with wider aspects of society and culture. These limitations then become imbedded in future generations.

Without exposure to positive role models this situation is unlikely to change. Many of the pupils at the school have poor self esteem with regard to learning in science. 'I'm no good at maths and science' is a common mantra. Role models are needed from both within the school, from within families and from the wider community to whom they can relate and who can inspire them. It is likely to be the role models from within the home and school who will have the most lasting impact.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The main route by which information regarding this project will be shared with other teachers and school leaders will be through the local authorities advisory service and through the IOP physics teacher network meetings. In addition the following routes will also be used:-
- school website
- school virtual learning environment
- school twitter account
- local press (an artical will also be submitted to the TES with the hope that publication will be possible)

Finally given the nature of the school there is a wide network of feeder schools from across local authorities and contact will be made via their special needs coordinators.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-09-03</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-09-04</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>5000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/M002462/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
