Recent high profile scandals (e.g. at the Mid Staffordshire Foundation NHS Trust) have raised notable concerns about levels of basic nursing care. Evidence indicates that caring is an attribute the public see as central to the role of a nurse. Thus, whether or not there has been a decline in caring within the nursing profession, supporting nurses to provide a high level of care is important.

How might the social sciences contribute to nursing education in a meaningful manner? Caring has various components which involve individuals feeling empathy and having practical skills. The social sciences can potentially inform both. To feel empathy requires individuals to have insight into the experiences of others, something to which the social sciences have made considerable contribution in the past (though the extent to which this has been used within nursing curricula has been limited). Providing practical care can also be informed by the social sciences. The needs of individuals will differ depending on their circumstances. For example, enabling self-care for someone living in the context of deprivation will involve some very different considerations to another scenario; say with a patient who is economically more secure even if the medical condition involved is the same. Understanding social context thus has considerable potential. The social sciences can also potentially facilitate reflective practice, thus helping nurses to more confidently challenge ineffective or sub-optimal practices.

Using insights from the social sciences (and specifically geography and ethnography as proposed here) is not going to be a simplistic fix to problems experienced in the health service, but has the potential to contribute to improving practice. We explicitly address gaps between theoretical ideas and practice by bringing together different groups of people: academics (from nursing as well as social science areas of work), policy makers who contribute to developing nursing curricula and nursing students (both pre- and post-registration). We adopt the framework of 'joint interpretive forums' for our seminars. This framework will enable theoretical ideas to be explained, questioned by people with very different perspectives and developed in a way that is relevant to practice.

The views of nursing students are crucial if the contribution the series aims to make to nursing care is to be meaningful to the teachers, researchers and practitioners of the future. The social sciences have demonstrated the importance of user participation and our inclusion of student nurses will not only capture their perspectives but also provide a model for the development of nursing curricula. A core group of student nurses will contribute to seminars and also be supported to write papers as a means of widely communicating their views. 

The series sets out with two seminars that consider the theoretical contributions geography and ethnography can make to nurse education. The ideas emerging from these early encounters are then developed in a third seminar through the analysis of a topical case study (Mid-Staffordshire). Hence we begin to unpack implications of practice in the face of realities to theory. The fourth and fifth seminars are dedicated to the discussion of the developing theoretical ideas from earlier seminars by those directly involved in nursing education - teachers and students. The final seminar then takes the ideas developed up to this point and engages directly with those whose responsibilities involve the development of curricula for nurses. We also use the opportunity to consider how the networks created by the series can be made sustainable so as to enable a more explicit on-going discussion regarding nursing education and the potential contributions of the social sciences.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Beneficiaries of the series will include the following groups:
- Patients
- Nurses
- And academics

Any improvement in nursing care will have benefits to patients. Critical and reflexive thinking are already well developed concepts within nursing but a more explicit utilisation of theories developed with the social sciences hold the potential to develop them still further and facilitate understanding (and thus responses) to caring for people whose lives are very different to those from which the nursing students understand. In so doing the series will also enable discussion of the theory practice-gap so as to explicitly recognise and challenge assumptions of both academics and practitioners and potentially empower nurses in their roles of ensuring the wellbeing of patients and coping with the realities of working in situations of limited resources.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>12315</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Paper to International Medical Geographies Symposium</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FC42BC7F-9E34-42B3-8D76-271D1499717E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The paper, &amp;quot;Transfusing our lifeblood: reframing research impact through interdisciplinary collaboration between health geography and nurse education&amp;quot;, communicated ideas emerging from the seminar series, and encouraged dialogue between social scientists and nurse educators.

Dame Jessica Corner, chair of the Council of Deans, stated that she was very interested in the potential to use social science approaches as a means to better enabling students to draw on theory in their day-to-day practice. She also praised the seminar series initiative for bringing together different universities to work together on a particular issue.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5639c21b401264.68037139</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Objectives for the Social Science and Nursing Seminar Series have been met. Notable outcomes are identified below in relation to each objective:

Objective 1: The theoretical rationale for embedding/inclusion/integration of the social sciences in nurse education has built on earlier work through the course of the seminar series and particularly in the opening three meetings. 

Significant new perspectives have emerged as to the case for the social sciences as an essential component of nurse education. A key rationale is the need to understand the social context of people's lives in order to better plan care, but notably also to build and strengthen the empathy that enables compassionate care. A paper outlining some of these ideas, specifically biogeography, has now been accepted by the journal Nurse Education Today.

Objective 2: The series has identified new avenues for impact for the social sciences. 

The seminars took the form of 'joint interpretive forums', bringing together academics from nursing education and from various social sciences disciplines, as well as nursing students, and policy makers with responsibility to nurse education. Impact is increasingly important to the case for the social sciences. Contributors to the seminars from social science disciplines stated a realisation of opportunities to work collaboratively with nurse education, for example for academics based in schools of geography. A paper discussing this potential was presented at the IMGS in Vancouver, Canada, and has been submitted to the journal Social Science and Medicine. 

Another avenue for impact emerged from nursing students who participated in the series. Their idea was that understanding such research might better enable reflective engagement with clinical placements. Ways of taking forward that idea are being actively considered.

Objective 3: The 'joint interpretive forums' have enabled policy challenges to be identified.

Seminar attendees included representatives from the Chief Nursing Office for Scotland, Nurse Education Scotland, the Nursing and Midwifery Council, as well as heads of schools of nursing from across the UK. They were able to hear of, and discuss, the challenges experienced by academics endeavouring to integrate the social sciences into curriculum in a meaningful way. For example, a barrier indicated time and again in every seminar was that of curriculum overload, with programmes already having considerable material that made introduction of anything further challenging. Discussions on how these challenges might be met the include seminar series organisers are on-going. 

Objective 4: Particularly noteworthy networks have developed and are on-going as a result of the series. 

These networks include interdisciplinary links between social scientists and nurse educationalists, and with agencies who have responsibility for nurse education. These networks will be discussed further in the next section.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Findings are being taken forward as follows:

Discussions are continuing with the Nursing and Midwifery Council. These meetings have and are exploring ways in which outcomes from the seminar series can meaningfully contribute to the development of standards for nurse education, which are currently being reviewed.

Opportunities to take forward research that can address some of the research questions developed through the series are being actively explored. 

Dissemination is on-going, with papers submitted to peer reviewed journals thus far including Nurse Education in Practice and Social Science and Medicine. These papers have involved collaboration between academics who have come to together as a result of the series from across the UK, as well as internationally, including Gavin Andrews from McMaster University, Canada. Conference presentations have been delivered at international conferences including NETNEP 2016 in Brisbane Australia, and the IMGS 2015 in Vancouver, Canada (which resulted in an invitation to submit a paper to Social Science and Medicine), both in the social sciences and in nurse education. Further opportunities to give papers are being actively considered.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>62491EDD-64A3-4D6F-AD90-E5FDACD869BE</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dd7518085384.00797511</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://socialscienceandnursing.com</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Meeting with and at request of Director of Council of Deans (organisation that represents schools of nursing, midwifery and other allied health care professions)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>306CA040-9986-4A88-BC5C-29569A24B3F0</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dd77f734bbc2.77105406</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Request to contribute to consultation on development of new standards for undergraduate nurse education</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BC894D0B-1EAC-4D2C-A697-8E45B9B7F00A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58be69f43e40b6.73498667</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/L000741/2</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:parents><gtr:parent><gtr:id>4E202804-B409-4EDD-8066-D49C165602FC</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>ES/L000741/1</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>20835.76</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2014-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2014-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:children><gtr:child rel="Transfer"><gtr:id>9C976AFC-6C1C-4405-B626-F486C810C5E1</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>ES/L000741/2</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>12315.26</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2016-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:children/></gtr:child></gtr:children></gtr:parent></gtr:parents></gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5BECA85F-CCD1-43D9-9B33-FFDFF6377498</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Med Soc/Soc Health &amp; Illness</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A05AA82B-96A8-4834-97FE-23963DE22DB5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Phases of education</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1AB3F721-B2D1-4875-A568-E7F49B4465E9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
