It causes significant morbidity and mortality with approximately 10% of people having contemplated suicide as a result of suffering from psoriasis. It is a major economic burden
and the global cost is estimated to be in excess of USD 6.7 billion with the cost to the NHS exceeding GBP 50 million per annum. There is currently no cure and the available treatments may have quite severe side effects. Although the precise cause of psoriasis is not known, dysregulation of the immune system is thought to play a significant role.

Our research group has made a significant contribution toward understanding the immunological basis of psoriasis, and in particular the involvement of dendritic cells (DCs) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) early on in the development of psoriasis. These cells are very much the sentinels of the immune system and are some of the first to become involved in the development of psoriasis. The project will further investigate what triggers these cells and how the triggers themselves can be manipulated which may eventually lead to new targeted therapies.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Aim: To determine the role of the antimicrobial peptide, LL-37, in the pathogenesis of psoriasis?

Psoriasis pathogenesis involves the dysregulation of both innate and adaptive immunity. The innate system involves tissue resident dendritic cells (DCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs). The latter can be triggered to produce large quantities of interferon alpha (IFN-?) which in turn impacts on adaptive immunity. One of these triggers has been identified as an antimicrobial peptide (AMP), LL-37. LL-37 coupled with autologous DNA delivers a TLR9 dependent proinflammatory stimulus to pDCs, thus breaking tolerance to self DNA in psoriatic skin. Little is currently known about the expression, regulation and in vivo function of LL-37 in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Our research objectives aim to address these questions.

Objectives

1) Define the expression and regulation of LL-37
2) Define the effect of LL-37 on phenotype and function of myeloid dendritic cells
3) Dissect the functional role of LL-37 in an in vivo model system of psoriasis

Design and methodology

We plan to establish in vitro cell systems which can then be translated into an in vivo psoriasis model. The in vitro techniques will involve cell culture (keratinocytes, fibroblasts, T-cells), immunohistochemistry, ELISA, confocal laser microscopy, flow cytometry for extra- and intracellular staining. Translation of this in vitro work to the in vivo model will use a variety of surgical techniques pertinent to tissue grafting. The in vivo work will establish the temporal and spatial localisation of LL-37 in xenografts during the development of psoriasis, establish the effect of anti-TNF therapy on LL-37, and determine the effect of LL-37 on normal skin in eliciting a psoriatic phenotype.

Scientific and medical opportunities

This project has the potential to elucidate key innate checkpoints leading to IFN-? production and downstream activation of the adaptive immune system. These are potentially powerful therapeutic targets and clinical translation of this work may have far reaching implications for other diseases of immune dysregulation such as inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn?s disease), systemic lupus erythematosus, diabetes mellitus and rheumatoid arthritis.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>241944</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">G0800471</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>7EE9741E-CF94-420A-B0AB-A7811523CF2C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Skin</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
