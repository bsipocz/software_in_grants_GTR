This area of research was transformed in the 1980s when electronic resources with large sets of historical data (corpora) became available for study. Corpora made it possible to study language change with quantitative methods for the first time. Historical corpus linguistics has focused on the development of more and better corpora and of quantitative methods. Methods for qualitative analysis have not been adapted to exploit all possibilities offered by the new resources. The main objective of this project is to redress this balance and put qualitative research and methodology on the agenda. It will do so by
- proposing new qualitative methods to identify changes in historical corpus data, 
- showing the descriptive gain they offer, 
- showing that new data found with this methodology can bear on longstanding questions in historical linguistics such as the question how language change happens.

First, I will develop new methods to identify one particular type of change, that by which linguistic items acquire a new function. An example is the change of the word 'certain', which originally only occurred in combinations such as 'a certain victory', where it means &amp;quot;sure, guaranteed&amp;quot; and its function is to describe a property of the victory in question. Through language change, 'certain' developed a new function as determiner: e.g. 'certain people don't like cats' where 'certain' is equivalent to 'some'. In this change, the form 'certain' remains the same. This raises the question how we can distinguish between the two functions in historical corpus data and which empirical evidence we can adduce for this change. The new methodology will consist of types of evidence relating to the form of the item and/or the range of contexts the item occurs in (its distribution) because changes to these aspects can be observed when comparing data for different periods. Because the methods investigate individual items, they are said to operate at the micro-level (rather than at the macro-level of abstract concepts such as e.g. word classes).
 
In a second stage, I will test how efficient the new methodology is by applying it to two new sets of data which look at English items like 'certain' which have different functions in the noun phrase (a constituent such as 'a boy', 'the happy parrot', which identifies entities). These sets involve (1) items such as 'pretty' which has an original function of ascribing a property (being good-looking), e.g. 'a pretty girl', but which also has a new function in which it intensifies another item describing a property, e.g. in 'a pretty bad week' and (2) items such as 'hard', which can ascribe a property (being solid, firm), e.g. 'a hard rock', but has developed a new function in 'a hard cheese' where it indicates a subtype of cheese (hard cheeses such as gouda as opposed to soft cheeses such as brie). I will show that the micro-analytical methods improve the description of the changes on the level of the individual items and that of the functions.

The third stage of the project reconstructs how change might have happened for the items in these data sets on the basis of the new micro-analytical descriptions. One of the main questions is how the mechanisms found with the new methodology relate to the two main mechanisms of change that have been distinguished in historical linguistics: reanalysis, i.e. the syntax of a linguistic item is reinterpreted in a different way (e.g. 'hamburger' was analysed as hamburg-er, but reanalysed as ham-burger), and analogy, i.e. the extension of a form from one environment to another based on similarity (e.g. 'cheeseburger' and 'fishburger' are created by analogy with 'hamburger' after its reanalysis). My hypothesis is that analogy plays the most important role in the changes of 'pretty', 'hard', but does so in different ways with different elements acting as attractor for the analogy.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project targets one specific non-academic beneficiary: school students studying A-level English Language and their teachers. The current curricula for A-level English Language include modules on the History of English and on (Recent) Language Change. Students learn what the English language looks like at different historical stages, and compare old and new meanings, old and new spellings, old and new grammatical patterns, in data from different periods. This before-and-after approach gives students a good idea of what changes, but cannot explain what the change itself involves or how it can be observed in actual language use in a scientific way. The proposed impact activities involve the organization of a workshop offered at different dates in the year to suit schools, in which students will use corpora with historical data to 'discover' ongoing change for well-known case studies such as 'bloody' in the literal sense &amp;gt; 'bloody' as marker of degree, 'a bloody idiot'. The workshops will benefit from the expertise, networks and administrative support of the Outreach Team of the School of Arts, Languages and Cultures and of Multilingual Manchester, the main channel for outreach activities on linguistics and language in the Faculty of Humanities.

These workshops will benefit the students partaking on several levels:
- Knowledge and understanding: The workshop content enriches the students' knowledge of language change which is part of the A-level English Language curricula. Students will learn how language change happens in language use (what are input and output and how do we go from one to the other) and how we can study language change in a scientific way.
- Attitudes towards language use: The workshop stimulates students to think about language in a different, more open way where variation in usage is seen as a positive and ever-present aspect of language rather than a deviation from pre-set rules. They will inspire students to use language creatively and ignite in them a curiosity regarding actual usage that lies at the basis of academic study and research.
- Induction to university and higher education: The workshop targets year 12 students when they are first introduced to educational career options. It will give them a taste of research-led teaching and research on English language and linguistics.

The workshop materials together with an instruction manual will be made available as resource packs for teachers. The packs will be promoted via Multilingual Manchester and by the Outreach and Widening Participation teams of the School to ensure more teachers than those whose students partake in the workshops are aware of them.

The workshops are set up to be sustainable after the completion of this project. The administrative support is not funded by the project, but by School and Faculty; the materials can be re-used. The workshops can be re-run in future years as part of widening participation and other outreach activities. It is thus not just the students and teachers who are participating in the workshop during the fellowship that will benefit, but further generations will benefit in all the same ways.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>93689</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Oslo</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Norway, Kingdom of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Literature, Area Studies and European Languages</gtr:department><gtr:description>Constraints on Syntactic Variation: Noun Phrases in Early Germanic Languages</gtr:description><gtr:id>DBC95A7C-6B78-4534-A03C-D44DDE741860</gtr:id><gtr:impact>conference presentation: Modifiers in Early Germanic: a comparative corpus study.
