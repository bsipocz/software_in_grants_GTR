However, it has proven remarkably difficult to provide a theoretical account of word meaning that is faithful to two deeply ingrained intuitions. On the one hand, there is an intuition that a word has a fixed linguistic meaning; on the other hand, we interpret words differently in different contexts. Reading the instruction 'Keep shut' printed on a fire door, we understand that we may in fact open the door and pass through it, but should shut it behind us. When the instruction occurs on an oven door in which a souffl&amp;eacute; is rising, we realize we should not open the door. Interpretation depends in part on the particular situation of use, yet there is also an intuition that 'keep shut' has a constant linguistic meaning. \n\nThis phenomenon can be replicated for almost any word. Interpretation of the verb 'paint' differs in each of the following: 'Michelangelo painted a picture', 'John painted his house', 'Mary painted her fingernails'. How we interpret 'moving' when we say 'The trees are moving' depends on whether we are interested in wind strength or in the possibility of a landslide. How we interpret the claim that a situation is an 'emergency' depends in part on the nature of the specific occasion. Yet there is also a robust intuition that the words 'painted', 'moving', and 'emergency' have a linguistic meaning which is constant across all occasions of use. It seems highly plausible that our knowledge of this constant linguistic meaning plays a crucial role in the explanation of (i) how we apply a word in different contexts, and (ii) how we understand what someone says by uttering the word in different contexts. The central aim of the project is to spell out what kind of a thing word meaning must be in order to play these roles.\n\nIf knowledge of the linguistic meaning of a word guides its application in a systematic way but does not etermine in advance its correct application for every conceivable context of utterance, it seems that the meaning must be schematic rather than fully specified, hence some kind of outline or template. A meaning schema guides us toward the correct interpretation only if we can draw on our common-sense or pragmatic know-how when using it. The project will develop an account of word meaning in terms of this notion of a schema or outline. We will show how, in conjunction with general cognitive-pragmatic abilities, this account of word meaning can explain the range of interpretations a word may have in different contexts. In order to assess the explanatory weight of this view of word meaning, it will be applied to various different kinds of words, including general terms like 'shut', 'paint', and 'moving', proper names and pronouns, and connectives like 'but', 'if ...then' and 'so'. Finally, we will use our results to shed light on some longstanding debates in linguistics and philosophy, including the relation between word meanings and concepts.\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Language is basic to human interaction and one of the most fundamental questions about language concerns the nature of word meaning: what it is and how it enables us to communicate our thoughts to each other. This is the focus of our project, which is, therefore, directly relevant to the fundamental issue of understanding the human condition.\n\nThe proposed research will help to explain why using language can often be surprisingly uncertain and how apparently straightforward instances of verbal communication can go wrong, something which is potentially exacerbated by the recent growth of e-communication. Full explicitness seems to be impossible - every word, phrase and sentence is open to multiple interpretations. Awareness of this is of central importance for many individuals and groups, e.g. policy makers, law makers (and interpreters of policies and laws), and all who work in businesses in which communication plays a major role. It is also relevant to the general public. We might think we have communicated something clearly, only to find that our words have been construed in a way that we did not intend. This need not be due to any obvious 'mistake' made by us or by our audience. Our research sets out to provide a theoretical background, together with analyses of particular words, to help explain how this arises. The basic idea is that word meaning is quite distinct from the meaning that gets communicated and it provides just a minimal schematic guide to communicated meaning, which depends additionally on features of the specific context of use and the mental states of the specific speaker and hearer. \n\nWhile we cannot predict the precise influence or impact of our research, we believe it is highly relevant to several areas in which the topic of word meaning is of central social importance. The first of these is young children's language development: our research may increase understanding of how children manage to acquire vocabulary so rapidly, and give insight into specific phenomena, such as children's well-known tendency towards over-extension of word use. Second, the research might well suggest new techniques for learning vocabulary in second languages. Third, it may help in the understanding of certain impairments of language use, as in the case of autistic people who are unable to go beyond a very limited literal meaning for words. Fourth, in providing a new account of word meaning, it may indicate alternative strategies for artificial intelligence endeavours to model human language use. We anticipate that our research will help develop an explicit interest in word meaning beyond just the philosophical and linguistic academic disciplines. \n\nWe will organise a conference to disseminate the research results across the academic community. The primary means for enabling the wider community to benefit from our work is by presenting our results, as they arise over the three years, on a website, which will be available to everyone. There is a great interest in language among the British public, as evident from such Radio 4 programmes as 'Word of Mouth', to which linguists are often invited: the issue of word meaning and the problems that can arise for understanding words in context is a promising topic for such a programme. As well as disseminating our work through academic publications, we will make use of more popular means such as talks open to the public and podcasts (e.g. Philosophy Bites).\n\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>314826</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Our key-finding is that established views of word meaning don't do justice to the open texture of most words.
