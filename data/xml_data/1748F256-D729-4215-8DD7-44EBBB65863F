The only nationally representative studies in England in the last 25 years (Strand &amp;amp; Lindsay, 2009; 2012) report a more nuanced picture across different types of disability, with for example Black Caribbean pupils being twice as likely as White British pupils to be identified with Behavioural and Emotional and Social Difficulties, but Asian pupils being only half as likely as White British pupils to be identified with Autistic Spectrum Disorders. There are concerns this over-representation reflects social bias in school identification processes and results in inappropriate special education provision, while under-representation reflects cultural or economic barriers to accessing services and results in unmet need. These results have important implications for Government, Local Authorities and schools as the Equalities Act (2010) places a general duty on all public bodies to eliminate unlawful discrimination and advance equal opportunity.

However relatively little is known about the factors which contribute to ethnic disproportionality, largely because of methodological limitations. Studies in the UK have often been small scale and unrepresentative while studies in the US are typically large but based on aggregate data that do not allow the sophisticated analyses possible only with student level data, or based on longitudinal surveys but with samples that are small relative to the incidence of special education. Methodologically, this project will provide three innovations. First it will use national census data on over 6 million students aged 5-16 years to build a nuanced picture across all ethnic groups for every category of SEN. Second it will be the first to utilise multilevel statistical models to estimate the relative influences of student, school and local authority (LA) factors on SEN identification. Third it will move beyond static models of SEN identification at a single point in time to build a dynamic model of the development of SEN by tracking two cohorts, each of 575,000 students, as they progress over time, one through primary school (from Reception to Y6) and the other through secondary school (from Y6 to Y11). 

Theoretically, the research will allow the evaluation of competing hypothesises about the possible causes of unequal representation, for example by determining whether socio-economic factors such as poverty and economic deprivation can account for the ethnic disproportionality in different types of SEN. The impact of other factors including age, gender, early educational attainment, attendance and behaviour will be explored, as well as school and LA factors such as size, type and social and ethnic composition. The project addresses published DFE research priorities (2014) around the accurate identification of SEN, the ESRC strategic priority to promote a Vibrant and Fair Society and the Equalities Act (2010) duty to eliminate unlawful discrimination. It is timely given the introduction of a new SEN and Disability Code of Practice in September 2014 and the fact that ethnic minority students now constitute over one-quarter (28%) of the age 5-16 school population.

The project will have wide impact mediated by a strong advisory group comprising practitioners and policy advisers as well as notable academics in the fields of education, psychology and sociology. The outputs will be tailored to maximise impact by: (i) communicating through short accessible summaries and reports; (ii) targeting outputs through practitioner and professional networks; (iii) producing a comprehensive Local Authority (LA) data pack identifying levels of disproportionality for all 150 LAs in England allowing benchmarking and comparative analysis, and; (iv) holding a user-focussed national dissemination event.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research?

The proposed project has a great deal of potential for impact through supporting the DFE to develop more effective policies around appropriate and accurate identification of SEN, supporting Local Authorities in meeting their duties under the Equalities Act (2010) and by informing on-going public discussion on the factors influencing the identification of SEN for different social and ethnic groups. This includes:

* Policy makers at national level in education focussed on supporting appropriate and proportionate identification of SEN (e.g. Department for Education), equity in educational outcomes (e.g. Equalities and Human Rights Commission) and other interest groups (National Association for Special Educational Needs, National Association for Language Development in the Curriculum, British Psychological Society and others).

* Local Authority Services involved in the identification and support of young people with SEN and their families (e.g. Principal Educational Psychologists, SEN Support Services) and those involved in local planning and provision of different kinds of health and educational support (e.g. the provision of Sensory Impairment Services in area with large Pakistani and Bangladeshi populations).

* Other LA Services such as Ethnic Minority Achievement Services (EMAS) and Research and Statistics Services with a focus on raising standards and addressing equity in educational outcomes.

* School leaders, SEN Co-ordinators (SENCOs) and teaching staff through a fuller understanding of the role of school norms and the potential for social biases in the processes of SEN identification. 

* Parents and children with SEN through longer-term improvements in the equitability of the process of SEN identification. 

How will they benefit from this research?

An important part of the project will be to tailor and modify the evidence found into easily usable forms for the different audiences at the levels of national policymakers, local authorities, schools and families. We have recruited an Expert Advisory Group (EAG) of professional users, policy advisers and notable academics in the area from the multi-disciplinary fields of education, sociology and psychology who are already involved in shaping the research and its direction (see attached eight letters of support from Directors of Education and other senior managers). This group will co-produce and focus our outputs for each of our target audiences. These forms will include evidence summaries, press releases, media pieces as well as conferences and other project publications (e.g. see academic beneficiaries). 

A particularly significant output from the project is the LA Data Pack. The Equalities Act (2010) place a general duty on all public bodies to eliminate unlawful discrimination and advance equality of opportunity. However while LAs have the statutory responsibility to identify and address SEN in their areas there are no statutory requirements on LAs with regard to collecting, examining and reporting on disproportionality in SEN, no published indicators or accountability measures, and so no evidence as to the extent of ethnic disproportionality at local level. There is a gap between the general duties of the Equalities Act (2010) and the specific evidence needed to identify and address issues of ethnic disproportionality. The LA Data Pack will be aimed at LA service Leads and will allow LAs to identify the extent of disproportionality for each type of SEN in their area, to examine and question this in the light of their knowledge of local factors, to compare raw and adjusted figures after taking account of socio-economic and other factors, and to interrogate data across LAs to provide a basis for comparison, benchmarking and focussed questions.
