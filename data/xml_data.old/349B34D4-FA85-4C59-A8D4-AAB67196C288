Whilst a minority have worked in 'above-the-line' roles (directors, costume designers), thousands have been employed in 'below-the-line' roles as hairdressers, continuity 'girls', production assistants, and negative cutters, yet their history has barely been studied. Much of their work has been undervalued by academic scholarship which has privileged auteur-directors, and its study hampered by scarce archival sources. This research project looks at the historical relations between women &amp;amp; production by exploring women's contribution through ACT/T trade union records and oral history testimony. From 1933-89 film &amp;amp; commercial TV operated as a closed shop and BBC employment was similarly regulated. By tracing women's contribution through union membership this project will provide empirical data about how many women worked in the industries, their roles and their movement between film/TV. This data will be supplemented by oral history interviews with women which explore their working lives. In bringing these two approaches together this project will unlock previously hidden evidence about women's work, and develop new ways of conceptualising and historicising the film/TV industries through the experiences of below-the-line workers. This will have a wider impact on both the study of film/TV and our understanding of the role of women in 20thC creative arts/industries. 
This 3.5-year project has 2 key parts. Part 1, based at the Universities of Newcastle &amp;amp; Sunderland, is led by the PI (Dr Melanie Bell) and CI (Dr Vicky Ball) and comprises a Research Associate (RA), a PhD, a major conference and papers, union training workshops, a website, an oral history project, and a monograph. The PhD will use historical union data to survey women in a chosen industry grade (e.g. producer, editor), and use written, oral &amp;amp; visual evidence from films to produce a number of case studies which analyse women's contributions to the field, thus extending our knowledge of women's work. The conference will draw together academics, archivists, TV/film industry personnel, and policy-makers to explore how long-established working practices have shaped the various dimensions of women's employment in the industries. The RA will lead the oral history component, recording interviews with 25 women, prioritising grades where few historical records remain e.g. make-up, wardrobe, continuity. The interview material will be hosted on a project website and used in BECTU union training workshops with current industry practitioners. The final project outcome (yr 3.5) will be a monograph by the PI/CI which analyses gender and production culture in ACT/T's 3 branches (Film Production, Laboratory, TV) and the BBC, assesses women's campaigning activities (ACTT Equality Committee) and provides case studies of women's work in Costume, Make-Up and Scriptwriting. Part 2, sub-contracted to the British Universities Film &amp;amp; Video Council, will produce a database of ACT/T union membership application data under agreement with the film/TV union, now named BECTU. Whilst the project team will work specifically on women's grades &amp;amp; pay, the database will hold membership application data for both women &amp;amp; men (67,000 apps. in total) ensuring its future potential as a major digital resource for other researchers. Published in yr 3 it will be hosted on a contextual website containing case studies &amp;amp; oral history material and maintained by the BUFVC beyond the life of the project. By bringing into clearer focus the historical gendering of working patterns &amp;amp; production cultures the project's findings will benefit academics/students of film/TV/gender/labour history, and provide a body of evidence which industry personnel/policy-makers may draw upon to intervene in current policy/practice.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The first area of impact comes from the project's partnership with BECTU. The BUFVC project website and its digitised resources (ACT/T membership application data, oral histories interviews) will make a major contribution to the history of women's work in the production of film and television. BECTU will also benefit from the oral history learning resource developed by the project for use in union training sessions and workshops, which will prompt discussion amongst its members about equality and diversity. This output has significant impact potential which will be measured through workshop participant feedback and BECTU-administered questionnaires in subsequent years. The RA will publish a self-reflexive account of methodology, of interest to trainers/oral historians in other subject-specific contexts. 

Secondly, the materials housed on the BUFVC website (searchable database, application data, oral histories, case studies, self-reflexive report on database design and research methodology, and PhD self-reflexive diary) will be of use to archivists, users of media archives, industry workers, their representative bodies and the general public, beyond the scope and life-span of this project. The self-reflexive report on research methodology will suggest alternative ways of using the database and digitised application forms. The PhD's self-reflexive diary will provide a toolkit for researchers and students. Both research outputs will benefit researchers across a number of disciplines (see outputs &amp;amp; academic beneficiaries). 

Thirdly, findings from the project will be used for advocacy purposes at events organised by industry groups Women in Film &amp;amp; TV (WFTV) &amp;amp; Skillset. They will be used in three main ways: 
1. to raise awareness and promote discussion of equality and diversity practice;
2. to promote women's contributions to film and television production;
3. to raise new expectations and point to new career aspirations for girls/young women. 

The fourth output designed to engage potential beneficiaries with the research is the project conference (July 2016) which has four panels targeting the industry, archival and academic sectors: 
1. The 'Women &amp;amp; Industry' panel will highlight the relevance of our historical study to the current context and women's position therein. The research and findings from our project will be able to historicise/contextualise findings and trends identified in post-1995 government commissioned reports. The conference will be a crucial forum to bring together representatives from government and industry who have a vested interest in equal opportunities; DCMS, Skillset, BFI, Arts Council, BBC, ITV and CH 4, as well as workers themselves and their representative groups (WFTV &amp;amp; BECTU). 
2. The 'Women &amp;amp; Work' panel will celebrate and debate women's creative contributions to film/TV, past and present, by inviting a cross-generational panel of women to discuss their work and working practices. 
3. The 'Women &amp;amp; the Unions' panel will feature representatives from BECTU's Equality Committee (past and present), their training team, and their Young Persons Forum to speak about the union's relationship to equality and diversity issues, and debate future pathways. 
4. The 'Women &amp;amp; the Archives' panel will invite representatives from national/regional film and TV archives, company archives such as Granada and curators, librarians and researchers. The panel will address future pathways to enable the education, research and preservation of materials related to women's film/TV history.
The project's conference will therefore provide a stimulus, in terms of impact, to policy-makers and industry groups, women workers, BECTU, archivists and researchers to debate the key issues relating to women's work in film and television production (both past, present and future) and, via the project website and media publicity, bring the project and the issues it raises to wider public attention.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>488329</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>BECTU Women's Committee (London)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>93323B47-86D6-46C7-B1E0-F8564D962DF8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>PI and RA attended and presented at the BECTU Women's Committee, attended by 60 participants from across the UK. BECTU is the media and entertainment union (representing professionals across all media including film, television, radio, theatre). The Women's Committee meet annually to set goals and initiatives around equality and diversity. We gave a formal presentation and ran workshops using oral history interview material gathered from the research project. This material was used as a stimulus for debates around equality and diversity within the media. The Steering Group of the Women's Committee reported that the majority of delegates rated the event 'very successful' in their feedback forms.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56af3f87eb6684.43504001</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>245C21A7-C432-447D-899E-05E163CCE856</gtr:id><gtr:title>Using oral history audio material with groups: an exploration of second-generation listening</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Oral History Journal</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/271e75cf4b84aba372b1e7627625b2a5"><gtr:id>271e75cf4b84aba372b1e7627625b2a5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bradley, Susan</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c6c34d4ba786.59998674</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/K006940/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:parents><gtr:parent><gtr:id>349B34D4-FA85-4C59-A8D4-AAB67196C288</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>AH/K006940/1</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>488329.0</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2015-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:children><gtr:child rel="Transfer"><gtr:id>CC47726F-898C-41D6-96EF-8A58C3722382</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>AH/K006940/2</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>133443.57</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2018-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:children/></gtr:child></gtr:children></gtr:parent></gtr:parents></gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4A856E02-8C94-4981-B572-E381EEB60DD2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Media</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DCE73056-5E3D-4976-B573-234E5FF4D633</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic &amp; Social History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>CB9410C5-3524-4683-9A7C-9A18853F6F6F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Film History, T &amp; C</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>46E85C19-DECF-4873-978B-4B57CA5EAC7B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Television HTC</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>33A50DE3-0023-4F8B-810C-F0B929F9218F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Womens and Gender Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
