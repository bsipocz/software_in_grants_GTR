The aim of the IPPP is to play a key role in meeting STFC 's and the University of Durham's strategic goal of international excellence in research. Central to our mission is to provide strategic advice for the UK and global particle
physics community and to focus and amplify national and international experimental efforts.

The scientific interests of the IPPP cover all aspects of current particle phenomenology, ranging from neutrino and astro-particle physics, through flavour physics to collider phenomenology and model building at the highest energies. There are few groups world-wide with comparable coverage of phenomenological particle physics. The topics addressed by the IPPP include the design of new theoretical techniques, such as scattering amplitude computations and higher-order calculations, the construction, development, validation and deployment of multi-purpose event generators, and feasibility studies for new facilities. In addition, IPPP plays a pivotal role in the provision and further development of tools, calculations, analyses and exploitation strategies for LHC physics. IPPP is highly visible in leading studies for current and future neutrino facilities, another high priority endeavour. It is also involved in experimental developments in quark flavour physics at LHCb. Furthermore, IPPP has made major contributions to the phenomenology of Dark Matter and its searches at accelerator and non-accelerator based experiments, and to physics exploration beyond the Standard Model.

This project will ensure that the IPPP stays at the cutting edge of the development of predictions of what happens when ultra high energy protons collide by increasing the capacity of the High Throughput Computing IPPP cluster. The cluster has played a key role in the development of the IPPP as a leading international institute for developing the software that underpins particle phenomenology worldwide. The High Throughput Computing needs of the IPPP can be met with a combination of fast disk servers and standard ethernet-networked compute nodes, operating the same software platform, which is used by the experimenters, who will ultimately use the software being developed at the IPPP. These are very different requirements than those delivered by e.g. Dirac.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The excitement of basic science can have impact beyond the limits of Academia. In order to fulfil that promise the IPPP attaches great importance to publicizing its activities to the wider public, and in particular to raising the awareness of particle physics in schools. IPPP is also committed to equipping our PhD graduates and RAs with the necessary skills and experience for a rewarding career in academic or industrial research.

Outreach
--IPPP benefits from a full-time outreach officer, funded by the University

--Our innovative outreach project Higgs to Hubble (https://www.dur.ac.uk/physics.outreach/) continues to have a positive impact by using our research to engage and enthuse school children, their teachers and the wider community and stimulate their interest.

--Since 2012 IPPP has acted as host for a bi-annual residential Ogden Trust A2 Physics Symposium.

--Our programme for the general public has provided a broad spectrum of talks through a variety of learned organisations, including the British Association, the Royal Institution and the Institute of Physics, and through the many regional and nationally coordinated science festivals.

--We also create original and relevant teaching resources based upon our research and use this material in workshops as part of Continuing Professional Development courses and training support sessions for teachers.

--We also host an annual one day event for local teachers. A Day for Everyone Teaching Physics is designed to extend both specialist and non specialist teachers knowledge and understanding of physics and provide ideas for practical activities for the classroom.

--In Autumn 2015, we initiated &amp;quot;Saturday Morning Physics&amp;quot;, an annual series of 6 public lectures primarily aimed at high-school students, with an audience of up to 50. 

--For the past two years, we have organised a weekly one-hour Code Club at a local primary school based around python programming with a raspbery pi.

Education &amp;amp; Training

--We train our PhD graduates and RAs with the necessary skills and experience to allow them how to think independently and critically, and use analytic and computational skills to solve complex problems.

--Together with our colleagues in the Department of Mathematical Sciences, we run a formal training programme in theoretical particle physics for PhD students (and also MSc students, via the MSc in Particle, Fields and Cosmology).

--The main areas IPPP can contribute to training are in the close supervision in research projects that aid the development of a wide range of skills including advanced software development, abstract thought, high performance computing, as well as the capability of collaborative research both locally and internationally.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>50000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/P005934/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>9C124926-5968-486F-9B51-CCEB6C4E9650</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Particle physics - theory</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D1CFDBA8-6B0A-4F3B-A5BD-26C5EA182FA7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Phenomenology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>87664074-78C7-4224-9F97-36D3F3EF0984</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Quantum Field Theory</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9940145C-197A-4249-A190-A135B3FB0478</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>The Standard Model</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
