It also examines the extent to which there is a relationship between work flexibility and the employment of migrants, and how the interaction between these influences firm performance. In more general terms, the research contributes to the continuing debate about the performance of the UK economy, and its ?productivity gap?.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project overcomes the limitations of secondary data by having privileged access to a unique data base for three large companies, with some 80 hotels in the UK and the Netherlands. This provides data not just at establishment level, or even at departmental level, but at individual employee level. Data is recorded on an hourly basis for different types of labour inputs (part time, contracted, seasonal etc.) over a continuous five year period. Outputs are measured in terms of both service outcomes (rooms occupied etc.) and financial terms. The availability of data for 2007-13 also allows analysis of how firms have responded to a changing operating environment through the economic crisis.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will impact on a number of practice, policy and academic domains related to productivity, work flexibility, and migrant employment. The potential of previous research to understanding the relationships between these three research domains has been constrained because they have tended to be fragmented in terms of focus, methodologies and data sources. There has also been an unhelpful divide, at times, between hospitality and broader social science research agendas. The main impacts will be the following: 

i. Research partners interface. We aim to involve eProductive and the three hotel companies at an early stage as co-producers of the research in terms of identifying key questions and issues to be investigated in our analyses. We have already obtained commitments from all the industry partners not only to allow access to the data held by eProductive but also to commit to shaping detailed research questions, and the interpretation of the findings. We also plan eight interviews with each company (repeat interviews with HQ and three hotels) which will provide further opportunities to engage staff from across the company, and not only at the central executive level. Presenting the findings of the research at a workshop for the three companies will provide opportunities to think through the broader practice and policy implications of the research in terms of different types of work flexibility, and the variability of productivity across different organizational and time scales. 

ii Hotel industry interface. The main research findings will be disseminated in two ways. First, through virtual and paper circulation of briefing notes to the leading sector associations for hotels: Master Innholders, Institute of Hospitality, British Hospitality Association, and HOSPA. Secondly, via a workshop to disseminate the findings to representatives of these associations and to draw out policy and practice implications for wider circulation. Lockwood, who is currently Chair of the Executive Council and Board of Trustees of the Institute of Hospitality, will take on the role of Communications Director for the project. The main benefits for the industry lie in learning about, and contributing to understanding of, the influence of different forms of work flexibility and migrant employment on firm performance. 

iii. Academic-policy maker interface. The main contact points for impacting on policy are DBIS and DCMS. Williams had contact with representatives from DBIS through his involvement with two AIM programmes on productivity and innovation. Surrey has contacts with DCMS related to its leading role in UK research on tourism and hospitality. The research will make an input into high profile and pressing debates about a) flexibility and performance, b) the contribution of international migration to the UK economy, and c) the economic consequences of the UK's non-EU migration policies for productivity.
 
 iii. Academic community interface. This will be pursued at two main levels. First through a rigorous programme of academic publishing and conference papers aimed at a variety of groups (e.g. BAM, I-CHRIE, AIEST). We plan to publish a minimum of 4 key papers in high impact journals, in both hospitality and broader social science journals, in order to engage academics across a range of disciplines and research areas. Secondly, through an end-of-project symposium which will bring together academics, policy makers and the hotel sector. We aim to contribute to linking the debates around flexibility, migrant employment and performance by grounding these in a systematic and detailed empirical analysis. The project has its core in management studies and labour studies, but also connects to research on industrial relations, migration, and economic sociology.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>197984</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Eproductive</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Eproductive collaboration</gtr:description><gtr:id>1AE72D9D-2FD9-420F-BF56-FE38943B03F4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Yaduma, N., Williams, A.

It focuses on the productivity gap in hotels, a sector which has a relatively low level of productivity compared to the total economy, and faces particular challenges in terms of strong regular and irregular demand fluctuations. There are three main strands to the research, being: a) the productivity paradox or the failure of productivity levels to recover to pre 2008+ crisis levels, b) the extent to which labour management practices (especially flexible working) can respond to the challenges related to maintaining minimum staffing levels, and to responding to seasonal demand fluctuations, and c) assessing the contribution of migrant workers to both flexible working practices and to productivity levels. To date, we have published papers on the first two of these themes and our broader impact is mostly related to these. Our analysis of international migration is continuing, and to date has had limited wider social exposure. 

We have sought to make our research impactful in two main ways. First by engaging directly with the senior management of the three hotel chains that we have researched. This has taken the form of two meetings with their senior management at which we discussed our findings, and the implications for their management of labour, and of productivity levels. Secondly by talking to wider audiences through engaging in a virtual workshop with members of the Institute of Hospitality (senior managers in the sector), and via a workshop where we presented our findings in a series of sessions, alongside parallel presentations by industry representatives: People First, British Hospitality Association, and Institute of Hospitality. This engagement was facilitated by working alongside Eproductive, a data management company which was our partner in the research, and provided access to their unique longitudinal data set.

To date our research has had two main impacts. It has identified the wide variation in productivity levels between individual hotels, and also between departments within these. If there is a productivity gap, then it is strongly driven by a long tail of poorly performing establishments. Our research has allowed the hotel chains to identify both the strong and the weak performing establishments within their groups, leading to greater managerial focus on raising productivity in the latter. Given the nature of our research, the managerial focus has mainly been on the effectiveness of different labour flexibility practices, and on the variations in these across hotels and departments. The CEO of one of the three companies has already written to confirm the importance of our research to their understanding of productivity levels, and labour management practices.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>17E9A050-8D16-4F2E-8C51-9D1D5C33990F</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>544e8c184011e6.29508956</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project provided the most detailed study to date of the drivers of labour productivity at the level of individual hotels and departments within these. A unique data set was made available to the project team, which recorded the allocation of individual workers to particular departments within some 80 hotels, on an hourly basis from the mid 2000s to the end of 2013. The project has four main findings. First, the main driver of hotel productivity is demand, especially the distinctive seasonal pattern in occupancy levels. The challenges this poses at company level is exacerbated by the considerable variation in the patterns of demand faced by individual hotels. Secondly, the project also demonstrated that flexible working - both in the number of workers employed, and the mobility of workers between tasks - influences productivity. The most difficult challenge is how to balance the nominal labour costs (mainly wages) with the effective labour costs (which also reflect skills and competences). Thirdly, most hotels employ some workers on so-called zero hours contracts, as part of their strategies to achieve greater labour flexibility. However, although the effects on productivity generally tend to be positive, there is considerable variation in the utilisation of such contracts. Moreover, actual practices vary from employing workers for a very few hours occasionally to providing more or less regular full-time employment. Fourth, the employment of international migrant workers has mixed effects on productivity, but generally tends to be positive in the case of migrants from central and eastern Europe. This is particularly significant given that migrants are disproportionately important in the sector compared to the economy as a whole.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We have provided direct feedback on the research to industry participants. a) through reporting to and meeting with our main partner, Eproductive. Secondly, by making direct presentations to the chief executives, and or other leading managers, at the three hotel chains involved in the study. Thirdly, by providing a webinar on our work to the professional and industry members of the Institute of Hospitality.
The paper paves the way for more detailed micro-scale analyses of labour productivity which serve to challenge the findings of more aggregated studies. The main findings for the industry relate to recruitment and other HR practices, and to labour management practices in response to demand fluctuations.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D0C24E07-51BC-4497-B0AA-1D05E69A6941</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544e8bcac60c17.94920144</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Panel data provided by Eproductive on 80+ hotels belonging to 3 companies operating in the Netherlands and the UK.
