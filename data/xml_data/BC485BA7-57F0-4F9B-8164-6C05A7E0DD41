The purpose of the current proposalis to strengthen the existing project by drafting in the expertise ofMAM for a period of 5 months in the Spring Term 2010. The opportunityfor this has arisen because of the study leave recently granted toMAM. Since the largest part of MAM's salary will be paid by his homeinstitution, this application is merely asking for financial help withthe additional costs associated with living away from home; it thuspromises to provide excellent value in return for a very modestinvestment.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Algebraic logic is a long-established and well-understood part of the formal methods tool set, and is being used at the more theoretical end of semantics as well as applied areas such as automated theorem proving and automated reasoning. Its utility can be traced back to the fact that the underlying theory (especially universal algebra) is well developed within mathematics. Coalgebraic logic, on the other hand, has brought to light the deep connections between logic and computation via \emph{transition system semantics}, but applications in technology will require mature mathematical understanding of coalgebraic reasoning similar to what we have now for algebraic reasoning. This project (like the project CLES which it will support) can be viewed as an intermediate step in developing the theoretical understanding of coalgebraic logic that will make applications to technology possible. The specific topic of this project, probability, has been shown to be highly applicable in verification and modelling, as witnessed by the successful PRISM tool developed by M.~Kwiatkowska and her co-workers. The logic we are proposing to develop will add to this reasoning principles; these have the potential to aid system decomposition, which is an essential technique for overcoming the ``state explosion'' problem in model checking. Together, then, we expect the impact to be visible in the theoretical community, on the one hand, and the more applied field of verification and modelling. Ultimately, this will lead to programs and systems that are more reliable and resilient in practice.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-10-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-03-29</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>27904</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Chapman University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Duality of relations</gtr:description><gtr:id>DBAF7F74-8F8F-45BB-94AE-DAD1CC609BF1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This is a long project which has produced several hundred pages of drafts, but publications are to be submitted only in 2018, due to the complexity of the research.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58a4c622db9945.08939587-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Prof Moshier contributed time and expertise on the topics of Stone Duality, Domain Theory, and Relational Morphisms.

This requires to develop the duality not only for morphisms, but also for relations. During the project we realised that the mathematical foundations for the duality of relations were not developed enough for our purposes, and we concentrated on this problem first.

The key finding concerning relations consists in the insight that when working enriched over posets monotone relations can be tabulated by both spans and co-spans. This gave rise to 2 publications and allowed us to successfully develop the Stone duality approach to probabilistic transition systems on continuous state spaces in subsequent work (completed, but unpublished).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Coalgebras on continuous state spaces will be an imporant further development of the mathematical theory of coalgebras.

As this project is in the mathematical foundations of computer science no short-term impact outside academia can be expected. So I was tempted not to tick any of the boxes below, but the form did not allow me to do so. On the other hand, exactly becaue the research is foundational, potential impact is in all areas that do use computing devices, so I decided to tick all the boxes.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>BDB7EBEA-AAFA-47D4-AA17-864BCCA9BB56</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546dab83464c78.87181388</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Electronics,Energy,Environment,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Pharmace</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.cs.le.ac.uk/people/akurz/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0C448E18-C016-4096-9789-AFF8CE3E39D4</gtr:id><gtr:title>Relation lifting, with an application to the many-valued cover modality</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Logical Methods in Computer Science</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4e30cf267c79ac5a30b8b58ae682000b"><gtr:id>4e30cf267c79ac5a30b8b58ae682000b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bilkova M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>546da37245dd38.19760974</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/H04714X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
