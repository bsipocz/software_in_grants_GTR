Things</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/N02298X/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Today we use many objects not normally associated with computers or the internet. These include gas meters and lights in our homes, healthcare devices, water distribution systems and cars. Increasingly, such objects are digitally connected and some are transitioning from cellular network connections (M2M) to using the internet: e.g. smart meters and cars - ultimately self-driving cars may revolutionise transport. This trend is driven by numerous forces. The connection of objects and use of their data can cut costs (e.g. allowing remote control of processes) creates new business opportunities (e.g. tailored consumer offerings), and can lead to new services (e.g. keeping older people safe in their homes).
 
This vision of interconnected physical objects is commonly referred to as the Internet of Things. The examples above not only illustrate the vast potential of such technology for economic and societal benefit, they also hint that such a vision comes with serious challenges and threats. For example, information from a smart meter can be used to infer when people are at home, and an autonomous car must make quick decisions of moral dimensions when faced with a child running across on a busy road. This means the Internet of Things needs to evolve in a trustworthy manner that individuals can understand and be comfortable with. It also suggests that the Internet of Things needs to be resilient against active attacks from organised crime, terror organisations or state-sponsored aggressors. 

Therefore, this project creates a Hub for research, development, and translation for the Internet of Things, focussing on privacy, ethics, trust, reliability, acceptability, and security/safety: PETRAS, (also suggesting rock-solid foundations) for the Internet of Things. The Hub will be designed and run as a 'social and technological platform'. It will bring together UK academic institutions that are recognised international research leaders in this area, with users and partners from various industrial sectors, government agencies, and NGOs such as charities, to get a thorough understanding of these issues in terms of the potentially conflicting interests of private individuals, companies, and political institutions; and to become a world-leading centre for research, development, and innovation in this problem space. 

Central to the Hub approach is the flexibility during the research programme to create projects that explore issues through impactful co-design with technical and social science experts and stakeholders, and to engage more widely with centres of excellence in the UK and overseas. Research themes will cut across all projects: Privacy and Trust; Safety and Security; Adoption and Acceptability; Standards, Governance, and Policy; and Harnessing Economic Value. Properly understanding the interaction of these themes is vital, and a great social, moral, and economic responsibility of the Hub in influencing tomorrow's Internet of Things. For example, a secure system that does not adequately respect privacy, or where there is the mere hint of such inadequacy, is unlikely to prove acceptable. Demonstrators, like wearable sensors in health care, will be used to explore and evaluate these research themes and their tension. New solutions are expected to come out of the majority of projects and demonstrators, many solutions will be generalisable to problems in other sectors, and all projects will produce valuable insights. A robust governance and management structure will ensure good management of the research portfolio, excellent user engagement and focussed coordination of impact from deliverables.

The Hub will further draw on the expertise, networks, and on-going projects of its members to create a cross-disciplinary language for sharing problems and solutions across research domains, industrial sectors, and government departments. This common language will enhance the outreach, development, and training activities of the Hub.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-02-29</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1235329</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Callsign Ltd</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Re: Callsign support for the EPSRC call &amp;quot;Commitment to Privacy and Trust in Internet of Things Security&amp;quot;.</gtr:description><gtr:id>13EB2FF1-AC31-4E1B-84D1-89B1DCD2B915</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Callsign have written a letter of support committing their resources to the furtherance of this project.

Dear Professor Maple,

Re: Callsign support for the EPSRC call &amp;quot;Commitment to Privacy and Trust in Internet of Things Security&amp;quot;.

On behalf of Callsign, I would like to confirm full commitment and support for the establishment of a Research &amp;amp; Development (R&amp;amp;D) hub on privacy and trust in IoT.

Callsign is a rapidly growing start up that is internationally recognised for its game-changing approach to digital identification. Formed in 2011, Callsign has received investment from major tech and professional services firms including Qualcomm, Deutsche Telekom and Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu. Since its inception Callsign has placed major emphasis on continual R&amp;amp;D in the area of computer security, this is reflected in numerous international patents that have been filed and granted.

The company currently employs 38 staff, which is growing on a weekly basis. The majority of staff are software engineers and mathematicians with expertise in the field of computer security and cryptography. Our head office is located in Shoreditch, London with other offices in Palo Alto, California as well as Manhattan and Binghamton, New York. Our commitment to high calibre research is evidenced by the relationships we have formed with State University of New York (SUNY) and the University of Warwick. An annual security hackathon has been created with the Cyber Security Group at the University of Warwick with the inaugural hackathon held in June of 2015; the winning project was focused on preserving security in IoT.

The number of recent high-profile cybersecurity breaches has made securing the Internet of Things a major global priority. Callsign is investing heavily into the R&amp;amp;D of capabilities to help businesses achieve the appropriate levels of security in IoT. Of our R&amp;amp;D spend we will open up &amp;pound;150,000 to your research hub. Based upon this R&amp;amp;D it is anticipated that products will be developed that help businesses improve efficiency, reduce costs and enable improved management of security risks. Ultimately this will have a substantial positive impact on UK Plc. In addition to the direct opportunities and generation of economic wealth, the indirect benefits of the programme are expected to help position the UK as the centre of next generation cybersecurity capability.

Yours Sincerely,
 
Zia Hayat
President &amp;amp; Chief Executive Officer

L-3 TRL is an agile UK-based technology company, which designs and delivers advanced electronic systems for the protection of people, infrastructure and assets.
We operate in the fields of electronic warfare and cyber security, creating scalable solutions by investing in innovation and delivering excellence. Working in partnership with defence and civil organisations, we respond to their requirements, delivering precisely the right product at the right time, helping to counter evolving and emerging threats worldwide.
The research to be conducted in the Central Hub for Advanced Research in IoT (CHARIoT) supports work currently being conducted as part of the innovation programme within L-3 TRL. This work aligns with our strategic model, supporting our entry into the marketplace as a supplier of innovative and trusted solutions for loT Cyber Security and Secure Cloud Infrastructure.

L-3 TRL are a critical enabler for the adoption of IoT security and greatly wish to support the CHARIoT in order to meet the challenges of:
(i) Implementing safe and secure applications on resource-constrained lightweight loT devices, including compromise detection and the application of appropriate compromise responses,
(ii) Securing the requisite enterprise management services hosted by cloud providers,

L-3 TRL has a history of investing in strategic collaborations with major security vendors and with world leading Universities. We develop market leading products and research in the field of cyber security and high grade/high bandwidth cryptographic solutions. Our technical ability and market reputation underpins the objectives of this proposal for a Central Hub for Advanced Research in IoT. We are currently funding research into mobile cyber security at Warwick University with a final value expected to be circa &amp;pound;100,000.
The proposed research collaboration with the CHARIoT consortium will work alongside our in-house teams to support and extend our loT and cloud security service investigations. As part of the proposed collaboration with the CHARIoT consortium, L-3 TRL offers staff time for consultancy, guest lecturing and research collaboration from our leading area and product experts including:
&amp;middot; Paul Yates, Security Consultant who is a subject matter expert in the area of cloud security
&amp;middot; James Pyke, Assistant Chief Engineer for Cyber Products
&amp;middot; Steve Mason, Chief Technical Officer, who leads our cyber security innovation research
&amp;middot; A further one Engineer who will support the activities in this work
 
TRL Technology
 
As part of this support, we expect to be contributing advice through regular bilateral meetings with CHARIoT leaders/investigators.
We estimate the total value of this in-kind contribution to be approximately &amp;pound;90,000 in addition to the currently committed value of &amp;pound;100,000.
L-3 TRL expects the results of this research to augment their own defence and commercially positioned work, contributing to the essential analysis required in the fields of IoT and Cloud Security in order to support the projected speed of growth, and adoption of this technology.

Whilst L-3 TRL are still at the very early stages of our own research, I am confident that this proposed partnership would benefit both parties as well as producing significant ground breaking work in this essential field.

Re: (proposed) Cybersecurity of the Internet of Things Hub

I am pleased to confirm that Qonex, the consulting arm of Nexor, would be very happy to support your proposal to the above EPSRC funding call.
Nexor provides trustworthy solutions that enable people and enterprises to use technology more productively and securely. We work in industrial sectors as well as national infrastructure, government and defence organisations where the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information systems is critical. In 2015 we set up Qonex to specifically focus applying Nexor's core expertise in providing trustworthy solutions to the emerging Internet of Things. Our focus is to enable organisations deploying the Internet of Things, understand the cyber security aspects of technology innovation, and to manage the associated risks.

As this Internet of Things market evolves, we welcome collaborating more closely with the research hub to maintain our innovative edge by gaining a much better understanding of these areas as they develop. As an SME we cannot cover all the territory ourselves, and an association with research activities such as this provide us with valuable insight into where to prioritise our efforts.

We anticipate our level of support to include attendance and contribution in workshops, sandpits and seminars as part of information sharing. We estimate our contribution in kind is to a commercial value of &amp;pound;18,000 over the three year period. We would also anticipate working with the university in funded R&amp;amp;D projects to solve specific challenges as they arise.
Yours sincerely

Dear Sirs

CYBERSECURITY AND THE INTERNET OF THINGS HUB

We are writing to express our support for the cyber security and the internet of things hub.

About Pinsent Masons
Pinsent Masons is one of the largest law firms in the UK. We field more than 350 partners and 1500 lawyers with our largest presence in the UK but spread across 20 offices on 3 continents.

We advise clients in the manufacturing sector and have an extensive understanding of these businesses and the industries within which they operate. Our work covers the full range of activities including matters pertinent for present purposes such as data protection, IP, product liability, connectivity, information technology etc.
We would propose to support the consortium project from the UK. 

The importance of the internet of things
The internet of things, the ability of machines to communicate with each other, has profound implications for almost all business sectors including manufacturing. It potentially disrupts traditional business models and supply chains; brings new risks as well as opportunities; and raises a range of legal complexities. These include: how to manage restructuring in response to the disruption to business models; how to protect IP; cyber security; data protection and getting the right contracts in place for new risks, liabilities and relationships.
The internet of things enables manufacturers to gain more data about their operations, customers and markets. This then allows them to make efficiencies through more sophisticated distribution, better supply chains and improved operational effectiveness. These improvements are important to success in a highly competitive world and need to be embraced and managed through effective IT and data management.

With consideration for our own objectives and interest we are very much interested in working with you supporting your research hub as it directly aligns with the issues our clients are facing.
 
There is huge value in bringing together the proposed consortium in one structure to consider these issues. We have a long standing relationship with Warwick and have supported a number of research collaborations and joint seminars and initiatives.

Pinsent Masons Proposed Support to the Project
As well as supporting the project in concept, Pinsent Masons is keen to participate in a practical sense particular in relation to consideration of the data and security issues that may arise. Recognising cyber security as a pressing management issue we have invested already in investigating cyber security with our clients through surveys and assisting clients with cyber readiness and would be keen to bring these 'earnings to the hub.

We would envisage our support would include:- 
- attending any 'advisory group' or workshop sessions to input in respect of early consideration of legal implications;
- inputting into papers addressing legal and policy issues relevant to the project.
Based on the attendance at relevant meetings and the preparation of specific research and discussion papers we would be prepared to contribute senior lawyer time of up to 250 hours over three years at a notional value of up to &amp;pound;90,000.

Yours faithfully

Re: TRL Statement of support for the Centre for Internet of Things
TRL, the UK's Transport Research Laboratory, is an internationally recognised centre of excellence providing world-class research, consultancy and product testing, covering all aspects of transport. TRL was established in 1933 and since that time has continually made significant and lasting contributions to the development of safe, efficient and effective transport systems in the UK and beyond. We currently employ around 375 staff, most of whom are technical specialists in their field, with experts in engineering, statistics, software, psychology and human factors. TRL has access to a range of dedicated facilities including modelling &amp;amp; simulation software, advanced driving simulators, crash test rigs and test tracks. Our head office is in Crowthorne, Berkshire and the company has an annual turnover in excess of &amp;pound;30m. Satellite offices operate in Scotland, Wales, Dubai and Qatar. TRL operates the TRL Academy, an internal body with responsibility for maintaining the academic and research strengths upon which the organisation is founded. The Academy also manages our ongoing engagement with a range of universities and research organisations from the UK and beyond.
We are well aware of the strong capabilities of the core university partners and have a number of research connections. We are, for example, working with Warwick on a &amp;quot;Towards autonomy - Smart and connected control&amp;quot; EPSRC project so are very pleased to be supporting this impressive initiative.
TRL's business focuses on the generation and application of knowledge in the transport domain. We anticipate that IoT will be a major driver for innovation and development in transport over the next 10 years and will have a huge impact on the safety, efficiency and effectiveness of transport systems of all kinds. It is therefore vital that we understand these developments so that we remain relevant to our markets and customers and are better placed to generate and apply new knowledge in the area. We anticipate that IoT will impact particularly on connected and automated vehicles and on smart cities/smart infrastructure, all of which are important areas of work for us but also areas where the threat of cyber-crime is increasingly high-profile. We also need to understand how these aspects will be handled and will affect our clients and our work.
 
Project Partner Letter of Support
TFL Letter
 
 
 
We intend to engage with and contribute to the Research Hub in a number of ways. Firstly, we would seek to participate as members of the External Advisory Group to help provide direction and governance to the programme. Secondly, we would help to develop the scope for projects undertaken within the Centre's programme based on our knowledge of the domain and future research requirements; this will include participation in workshops, &amp;quot;sandpits&amp;quot; and the like. Thirdly, depending on the scope of the research, we may be able to supply research data or access to specific facilities or equipment. Finally, we would hope to find suitable projects in which we can collaborate (e.g. by contribution of staff effort, secondment of staff to the centre, hosting of centre staff at TRL and co-supervising PhD students).
It is difficult to define the precise financial value of our proposed in-kind support. For budgetary estimation purposes, we suggest maximum values for the four items described over a three year period as follows:
1. Participation in External Advisory Group activities &amp;pound;10k
2. Project scoping and advice &amp;pound;10k
3. Access to data and facilities &amp;pound;30k
4. Project collaboration &amp;pound;60k

In conclusion, we are very pleased to be supporting this impressive initiative directed by Professor Jeremy Watson of UCL. The Centre for the Internet of Things can develop as a Research Hub of activity in this priority area for the UK and TRL can play an active role in supporting its development and operation. We highly commend this proposal and look forward to joining a first class team.
Yours sincerely
