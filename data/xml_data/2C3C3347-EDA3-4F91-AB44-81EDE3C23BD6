NEMS</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/J00541X/2</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Tunable resonators have wide ranging applications such as in positioning systems (eg. portable GPS) and in many satellite systems, as well as in almost all wireless devices such as the mobile phone. Better the resonator, more favorable it is for the application in terms of speed, as well as signal quality. MEMS and NEMS have potential for very high quality factors, which can be taken advantage of for designing such resonators. One of the important characteristics of a resonator is its ability to adjust its frequency quickly, so that it can lock in to a signal speedily. In this project we propose a novel NEMS resonator whose frequency can be tuned rapidly (on the order of a few nanoseconds). In addition, this resonator would use materials that have potentially dual-functionality, to help not only in tuning the frequency, but also in sensing the frequency. Such a resonator would reduce costs, take up very much less space than existing resonators, and would be much simpler to fabricate. Furthermore, this research project would shed light on physical mechanisms such as the piezoresistivity of phase change materials, as well as the mechanical properties of such materials.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research performed during the course of this project will be widely disseminated in prestigious conferences such as the IEEE MEMS conference or the Micro-and NanoEngineering Conference (MNE) and Materials Research Society's (MRS) March Meeting. These conferences provide an effective medium for researchers in the industry and academia to benefit from the results derived during our research. Furthermore, results of this work will be published in peer-reviewed journals such as IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology, Nanotechnology and Applied Physics Letters. 
The research will be carried out in close collaboration with a UK-based SME (Small and Medium Enterprise) company involved in Phase Change materials, Plarion Ltd. Thus, promising developments during the project can be evaluated further by Plarion who are highly skilled in product commercialization. The Principal Investigator has previously been actively involved in much international collaboration, and has facilitated the commercialization of developed technology to an external company. He holds seven patent/ patent applications in both the EU and the US and has good connections with many industrial companies such as IBM, Plarion, Nanosensors, Asylum Research and the Swiss Microelectronics Center (CSEM). Thus any new result will be effectively communicated through this network in order to assess potential for commercialization. In addition, any patents arising out this project will be effectively managed via the University's Intellectual Property Team, and marketed to relevant companies interested in commercialization.
The work will result in helping train a postdoctoral researcher in the field. They will in-turn benefit the UK economy by entering the workforce with skills in two emerging Science and Technology fields - NEMS and Phase Change Memories. As we enter the realm of a global society, no one country can claim monopoly on knowledge as most large enterprises have a global presence. The presence of qualified people in the UK would thus benefit the UK by encouraging more companies to set up their facilities here. This would not only increase jobs in one sector, but also contribute to employment in the entire range of support and administrative staff that such a facility would need. Thus, there are potentially large benefits to helping educate and train people in high-technology fields. In addition, these technologies have the potential to impact society directly, with superior guidance systems resulting in faster positioning, better communication channels as well as aid in the research and study of new material systems that can impact society in positive ways.

Thus, the pathways to impact can be summarized as:
-Publications in high quality journals of international readership, and presentations in prestigious international conferences
-Training of a postdoctoral research associate in two emerging fields of high value - phase change materials and nanoelectromechanical systems. Furthermore, the postdoctoral research associate will attend public communications training in order to help her/him become an effective public speaker, fully capable of publicizing the research.

This study was published in the journal IEEE Access and is part of a Patent Application.

This grant was awarded to develop fundamental concepts of employing a class of materials termed phase change materials in nanoelectromechanical systems to enable fine tuning for RF applications. Our key findings were:
1) The total tuning possible using simple cantilever beam structures was very low, typically under 1%
2) It is very difficult to &amp;quot;switch&amp;quot; these materials electrically for laterally connected materials
3) New designs employing graphene provide the best possibility, but this requires a lot of experimental development in future.
4) We have developed the world's first piezoresistive sensing of graphene to go one part into achieving the goals of this project.
5) We have come up with a plausible design for being able to tune phase change materials with graphene electrodes.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Potential for use in high sensitive mass sensing (patent application filed) as well as displays (patent application filed).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>1518F768-40CC-4869-AAC5-A67B5BCF6238</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545d2bec5ead65.94012599</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Electronics,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://nanoeng.materials.ox.ac.uk/Advanced_Nanoscale_Engineering_at_Oxford/Home.html</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs><gtr:spinOutOutput><gtr:companyName>Bodle Technologies Limited</gtr:companyName><gtr:description>Bodle develops and commercialises a new class of active smart glazing products and displays.</gtr:description><gtr:id>127794C5-11AC-40CF-8E0C-2069A5ACAFF6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Bodle's core technology is about the creation and manipulation of colour that is reflected off a surface by changing the refractive index of ultra-thin functional layers. The technology is completely revolutionary, as it can achieve all of the following:
? Extremely high resolution, with pixel sizes of sub-100 nm already demonstrated (compared to several micrometers for the best current technology).
? Capable of very deep colour hues matching and even exceeding the range of colours possible by the latest technologies in displays
? Can be clearly viewed in bright lighting conditions
? Eye fatigue minimal as displays similar to paper
? Very low power similar to electrochromic displays
