An aging population and the need to substitute human workers in dangerous and repetitive tasks have now resulted in new tasks on the horizon (e.g., in agriculture automation and environmental monitoring), requiring our robots to do more, to work in large-numbers as part of a swarm (a large team of robots), to coordinately sense and act over vast areas, and efficiently perform their mission. However, our robot swarms to date are unprepared for deployment; unable to deal with the inevitable damages and faults sustained during operation, they remain frail systems that cease functioning in difficult conditions. The goal of this project is to remedy this situation by developing algorithms for robot swarms to rapidly -- in no more than a few minutes -- recover from faults and damages sustained by robots of the swarm.

The existing fault-tolerant systems for robot swarms are limited. They are constrained to only diagnose faults anticipated a priori by the designer, which can hardly encompass all the possible scenarios a robot swarm may encounter while operating in complex environments for extended periods of time. The multitude of robots in a swarm and the large number of intricate ways they can interact with each other makes it difficult to predict potential faults and predefine corresponding recovery strategies; which may explain why none of the existing fault-detection and fault-diagnosis systems have been extended to provide fault-recovery mechanisms for robot swarms. Therefore, in order to design fault-tolerant algorithms for robot swarms, we need to move beyond the traditional approaches relying on fault-diagnosis information for fault recovery.

Fault recovery in a robot swarm may instead be formulated as an online behavior-adaptation process. With such an approach, the robots of the swarm adapt their behavior to sustained faults by learning via trial-and-error new compensatory behaviors that work despite the faults. However, the current approaches to learning new robot swarm behaviors are time-consuming, requiring several hours. Therefore, such approaches are inappropriate for behavior adaptation (learning new swarm behaviors) for rapid fault recovery.

Behavior adaptation for effective fault recovery requires the robot swarm to creatively and rapidly learn new compensatory swarm behaviors online, that work despite the sustained faults, effectively recovering the swarm from the faults. The proposal will address these requirements by investigating data-efficient machine learning techniques for rapid online behavior adaptation, guided by creatively and automatically generated intuitions -- evolved offline -- of working swarm behaviors. The resulting system would have a significant impact on long-term operations of robot swarms, and open up new and interesting applications for their deployment, such as the monitoring of large bodies of water for pollutants using a swarm of autonomous surface vehicles.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed project aims to develop algorithmic approaches for large-scale low-cost robot swarms to rapidly recover -- in no more than a few minutes -- from faults and damages sustained by individual robots of the collective. This will be achieved through the development of a novel combination of data-efficient machine-learning, with nature-inspired computing algorithms. Though close collaboration with project partners, the developed fault-recovery algorithms will be used to help improve the long-term autonomy of robot swarms, evaluated on a indoor swarm of mobile robots, and an outdoor swarm of aquatic surface drones. The project outcome is geared towards developing resilient robot swarms, working seamlessly around us, delivering the following economic and societal contributions.

Economic impact: A June 2014 report by the Intellectual Property Office indicates that the UK Government has identified Robotic and Autonomous Systems (RAS) as one of eight impactful technologies with the potential to propel the UK to future growth (goo.gl/YBSJ24). Developed RAS technologies are predicted to enable the conception of new products and services, a market of over &amp;pound;70 billion by 2025, disrupting existing markets as divergent as environmental monitoring, transport, manufacturing, and medicine (goo.gl/hkxDJY). Therefore, it is essential for the UK to be at the forefront of this research area, to capture value as the markets disrupt and change.

Autonomous operation will be an essential feature of the next generation of robot swarms, allowing the robots to continue functioning despite faults resulting from common wear and tear of their functional parts, and unexpected changes in their operational environments. This ability increases the usefulness of the robots, and extends the amount of time they can continue operating without human intervention, thus providing a substantial economic advantage. For instance, industries deploying robot swarms do not expect their system to grindto a halt, every time the robots encounter an unanticipated situation, and individual robots suffer damages. They would preferably avoid disruptions in their regular operations, and the hefty start-up costs required to provide existing robot swarms with carefully controlled working environments, if that were even possible (e.g., robot swarms operating outdoors). The proposed research will contribute towards the development of long-term autonomous robot swarms, ideal for such scenarios.

One of the potentially impactful real-world application scenario for robot swarms is that of autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) in rivers, lakes and marine environments. In such environments, robots are required to operate over vast areas, with minimal human intervention. ASV robots have been commercialized, and widely used in commerce, industry and military applications; such an established and active market for the platform now opens up impactful avenues for applications with ASV swarms. Finally, a number of industry players in the UK have keen interests in this area. Engagement with these players will be fostered by industrially relevant (out of the lab) robot swarm case-studies, developed in collaboration with the Southampton Marine and Maritime Institute, MBDA-UK Ltd. and ASV Global.

Societal impact: The robot swarms envisioned in this project, capable of extended autonomy, also have the potential to directly impact important scientific endeavors, beyond the robotics community. In these endeavors, robots will be employed as a fundamental data-gathering tool, allowing a swarm of robots to provide us with a rich and continual stream of high-resolution data on observed environmental phenomena. For instance, a large swarm of aquatic surface drones fitted with Passive Acoustic Monitoring sensors, may intelligently monitor a water-body for the presence of marine mammals, providing valuable data for the regulation of shipping lanes.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>215173</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R030073/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5CBA14F4-F235-45B6-A9DD-5937D5C166CC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Electrical Engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>80</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
