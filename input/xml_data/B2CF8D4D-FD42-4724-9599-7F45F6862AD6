Through readings and applications of Jacques Derrida, Roland Barthes, Jacques Lacan and Jean Baudrillard, among others, performance theorists such as Peggy Phelan, Philip Auslander and Elinor Fuchs have helped to lay the theoretical foundations for a long-standing tradition of performance practice which rejects the conventions of dramatic theatre to adopt the premise that all meanings are contingent and relative, and that reality itself is necessarily multiple and subjective.\n\nThis study will draw on such existing scholarship to evidence the overwhelming consensus that overtly post-structuralist performance offers a radical alternative to dramatic realism in its capacity to challenge the grand narratives of Modernity, most specifically, through its contention that reality must be understood as subjective and contingent, rather than objective and absolute.\n\nThe aim of my research is not to dismiss or deny the premises of this consensus, but to question the widespread totality of their application. I will argue that they are too commonly employed to support claims to political radicalism on behalf of all productions which draw on poststructuralist performance motifs, and to dismiss, as politically reactionary, all productions which maintain the conventions of dramatic theatre. \n\nThrough my own analysis of post-structuralist theory and a wide range of models of contemporary practice, I will seek to demonstrate that ideological consequences cannot necessarily be predicted purely by an adherence to, or rejection of, dramatic conventions. I will also aim to show how an over-simplification of ideological analysis on the basis of form has penetrated the market for new work, and impacted on the type of new work which gets made, funded and supported by the international performance networks.\n\nMy conclusions will be disseminated to the academic community through publication of a monograph by Manchester University Press in 2011. I will also seek to publish articles and features drawn from the research in periodicals which are accessed by the wider readership of industry makers, funders and promoters.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The integral relationship between contemporary theatre research in the academy and developments in the new theatre industry in this country (as evidenced in the attached impact plan) will enable the strategic aims of this research, which focus on precisely this relationship, to have a direct impact on the present and future generations of artists, producers, managers, funders, promoters and strategy makers within the British new theatre industry. In particular, the research will promote a greater awareness of how to assess the ideological implications of wide range of work much more rigorously than is currently the case.\n\nPotential Beneficiaries:\nArtists, creative producers, arts managers, arts funders, arts promoters, policy makers and strategy makers.\n\nNature of Benefit:The research findings will \n- enhance the knowledge economy in the arts\n- enhance public debates in the arts\n- inform developments in performance, professional practice and public policy\n\nFor example: \nArtists will benefit from an increased awareness of the existing binaries which might limit their experimentation, and be encouraged to seek to work beyond them. They will also be able to work with a greater awareness of the ideological implications of their work.\n\nCreative Producers, Managers, Arts Funders and Promoters will benefit from an increased awareness of the existing binaries which they may be consolidating in their own professional programming or funding decisions, and be encouraged to seek to break down any limitations which such binaries are placing on the artists they are supporting.They will also be able to work with a greater awareness of the ideological implications of the work they are supporting.\n\nPolicy and Strategy Makers will benefit from an increased awareness of the existing binaries they might be propagating in their own policies and strategies; for example in a separation of new writing and new work into two distinct streams/channels of development. They will benefit from an insight into the limitations these binaries may be imposing on artistic development and amend policies accordingly.\n\nMechanisms of Engagement:\nA significant number of researchers in this field are themselves practitioners, or have close working relationships with practitioners and those working in the industry, by sitting on boards of theatre organisations, strategic bodies etc. I am an associate director of Point Blank theatre which is also the founder member of the South Yorkshire Arts Consortium, an adviser for Shooting Fish Theatre, and a member of the action group, Challenge for Change, which consists of the key theatre funders, venue promoters and artists based in the West Midlands. Links like these between academic researchers and the industry will enable the research findings to be actively disseminated to those who are currently making strategic and artistic decisions within the industry. The research findings will also be disseminated to the current student body through teaching practice and will consequently play their role in shaping the strategic and artistic development of the next generation of artists and art managers. \n\nMethods of Dissemination: Subsequent to the publication of the book I will aim to\n- distribute details of the book directly to arts organisations through mailing lists and consortiums\n- engage in public debate at relevant theatre events, strategic meetings etc\n- place articles in arts journals and arts sections of newspapers to inspire debate amongst the industry professionals and theatre-going public\n- create and tour new performance work which, in itself, disseminates aspects of the theoretical research findings of this project.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>33140</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>I presented on my findings at a pubic panel at Oxford University in February 2015.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>13A48D67-8613-4EDF-89B8-F74D5E8DFF77</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>544a56a2268139.10816470</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The book establishes that the influential ideological dramatic/postdramatic binary of Hans Thies Lehmann does not stand up to rigorous testing. The book rather proposes that the dramatic is capable of auto-deconstruction, and the postdramatic is capable of logocentrism. It also interrogates the postmodern argument that deconstruction of representation is automatically politically radical by distinguishing between case studies where this is evidenced, and those where it isn't. It suggests that self-referentiality in verbatim performance can sometimes work against the possibility of political efficacy, and refutes the myth of the 'passive' spectator of dramatic realism, by examining the parallels between immersive theatre and corporate consumerism.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>As a re-assessment of common fallacies made by funding bodies and theatre critics of contemporary performance which influence the kinds of new work that are made and promoted.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>7EE3585E-57B1-4D94-9EA2-A85434862E26</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-396592412.51330113775fa6e2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3BCFEF55-B637-4477-8CF9-98B9E0D0FBB6</gtr:id><gtr:title>Acts and Apparitions: Discourses on the Real in Performance Practice and Theory, 1990-2010</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/1332bad3b8b699c65d6a208274818433"><gtr:id>1332bad3b8b699c65d6a208274818433</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Tomlin, Liz</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-0-7190-8372-3</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>i_23127263833c03387e</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I000607/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>38E9B207-EFC4-4B48-AF70-C67AC5978934</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Drama &amp; theatre studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>946C0541-464B-43A5-9EE3-65C23360E959</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Philosophy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>33E5E05F-68BD-4527-AEE5-B1E47B0D67FA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political Philosophy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4DC83A15-ACD4-4667-BA6F-2DB8EFCF166F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Theories Of Theatre</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
