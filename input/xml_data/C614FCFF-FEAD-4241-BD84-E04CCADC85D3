Although some treatments improve breathing tests, nothing has been shown to reduce mortality. Half of the patients diagnosed with the condition die within 3 years. We have conducted the largest study of pulmonary fibrosis in the UK, which suggested that taking the antibiotic co-trimoxazole regularly reduced patients? mortality to a fifth. Moreover there were fewer hospitalisations and deaths in patients assigned to take co-trimoxazole who had reduced breathing function. In the context of a disease with virtually no treatment, these results are exceptional and a larger study needs to be undertaken as soon as possible to prove or disprove these findings, and determine how co-trimoxazole may be working. We will identify patients with pulmonary fibrosis from hospitals in the UK using an established network of national experts. We have shown that co-trimoxazole is most effective in patients with reduced breathing function and so we will only include these patients. We will ask the patients to tell us how their disease affects them, using a new questionnaire, and to perform breathing tests and provide blood samples. This will tell us whether there is evidence of infection or scarring in their lungs. Half of the patients will then receive co-trimoxazole and the other half placebo tablets. We need to give some patients placebo tablets to establish if co-trimoxazole is beneficial. A group of patients will have a lung camera test (bronchoscopy) to obtain a sample of the fluid lining their lungs to assess for bacteria and molecules that indicate inflammation and tissue damage. Although a bronchoscopy is an invasive procedure it is often used to investigate patients with pulmonary fibrosis and will only be undertaken with the patient?s permission if it is deemed safe by the patient?s doctor. We will repeat these measurements after 3 months then every 6 months for 27 months and if patients are admitted to hospital with a worsening of their condition. We will measure the time between the start of the study and when patients are admitted to hospital or die, to determine whether co-trimoxazole is beneficial. We will use new molecular techniques to analyse the bacteria present in the patients? lungs and chemicals that tell us if the patients? scarring is worsening. This study will tell us whether co-trimoxazole affects the bugs within patients? lungs (and it may identify some unusual bugs) so we will know if it is working purely as an anti-bacterial or by some other method. We will monitor all patients for possible side effects. We will also find out whether the treatment changes chemicals within the blood and lungs of patients and this will to tell us whether co-trimoxazole is affecting the inflammatory process. We comprise a unique team of experts who conducted the initial study and have past experience of undertaking large studies such as this. We are the only UK team to have led a pulmonary fibrosis study of this scale. We are involving pioneers in assessing the bacteria in lung samples and authorities in lung inflammation. We need sufficient funds to be able to undertake this study to the standards required. This includes staff to manage, run and analyse the clinical trial; research nurses and doctors to perform the study measurements, funds to undertake the laboratory analyses, and support to share our findings with others.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>We hypothesise that the addition of co-trimoxazole to standard therapy is beneficial to patients with moderate to severe idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), based upon the findings from our previous study(Thorax 2013;68:155). We aim to investigate this by assessing unplanned hospitalisation-free survival and to determine whether any effect relates to changes in infection and/or markers of disease and neutrophil activity. Design: Double-blind placebo-controlled randomised multicentre clinical trial. Assessments will be undertaken at baseline, after 3 &amp;amp; 6 months then every 6 months and during any respiratory-related hospital admission for a median of 27 months (12 to 42 months). Population: 330 symptomatic (MRC dyspnoea score &amp;gt;1) patients older than 40 years with IPF diagnosed by a multi-disciplinary team according to international guidelines and a FVC&amp;lt;=70% predicted will be enrolled. Patients may receive pirfenidone and anti-oxidants but will be excluded if they have significant co-morbidities, are receiving immunosuppression (other than low dose prednisolone) or unlicensed medication. Intervention: Patients will be randomised to receive 2 tablets of co-trimoxazole 480mg or 2 placebo tablets twice daily. All patients will receive folic acid 5mg daily. Treatment will be reduced to 2 tablets plus 5mg folic acid three times weekly in patients developing gastrointestinal adverse effects or rash. This is a tolerated regime used for long term Pneumocystis jiroveci (PJ) prophylaxis. Primary outcome: Unplanned hospitalisation-free survival will be determined from adverse event reporting, hospital databases and the Office of National Statistics with active tracing of patients missing appointments. Secondary outcomes (1) King?s Brief Interstitial Lung Disease questionnaire, (2) MRC dyspnoea score, (3) EQ5D, (4) spirometry, (5) total lung diffusing capacity and (6) routine sputum microbiology. Blood (0, 3, 6 and 12 months and study exit) will be taken for cell count, biochemistry and stored for analysis of biomarkers including C-reactive protein and markers of disease (surfactant protein-D, and matrix metalloproteinase-7) and neutrophil activity (myeloperoxidase) at the end of the study, if appropriate. In addition, a subset of 50 patients will undergo bronchoscopy at baseline and after 3 months to evaluate the lower airway microbiota using high-throughput sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes, quantitative microbiological culture, PCR for PJ, differential cell count, neutrophil elastase, PIIINP and biomarkers (above). Statistical analysis: With 264 patients randomised over a period of 30 months and an additional 12 months follow-up after the last patient is recruited, the trial will have 80% power to show a change in hospitalisation free survival from a median of 28.8 months in the control arm to 51.1 months in the co-trimoxazole arm (hazard ratio of 0.56). The primary analysis will be on an ITT basis with adjustment for all variables used in the minimisation algorithm, with sensitivity analysis including only patients adhering to the high-dose regime. Analyses will be based on a proportional hazards regression model. The study will last for 4 years. Recruitment will take place in our established network of 21 sites. We expect set-up to take 2 months, recruitment for 30 months, follow-up for 12 months and study analysis and reporting to take 4 months, with a recruitment rate of 0.5 patients/centre/month or &amp;lt;15% of eligible patients.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>102964</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>71F9A51A-456A-4726-ABD0-66AF6C86B93C</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Efficacy and Mechanism Evaluation of Treating Idiopathic Pulmonary fibrosis with the Addition of Co-trimoxazole (EME-TIPAC): study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Trials</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ad05eb8af2eb3ea8a5dd12f4cd23bc6d"><gtr:id>ad05eb8af2eb3ea8a5dd12f4cd23bc6d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hammond M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1745-6215</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a900d6e05c4f9.28739079</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MC_PC_14145</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>E3CED108-9B11-45C4-A81B-3730D641CA68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Respiratory</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>8F896112-5A04-4A11-A9F0-2B446D9AAC8A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>5.1  Pharmaceuticals</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>7135039D-2DB0-4D41-87B3-FA1C8D38E133</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>6.1  Pharmaceuticals</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
