These two streams of transformation converge in our research postgraduate activities, and we take great care in the selection, training and mentoring of our junior researchers, and great pride in the world-class research in which they are engaged. 
Fundamental to the research across the whole University is the concept of interdisciplinarity leading to impact. This is particularly true for research funded by our EPSRC Doctoral Training Partnership (DTP). Students funded by the DTP will typically (though not always) have backgrounds in engineering or the mathematical and physical sciences, yet their research projects will generally be at interfaces between disciplines such as medicine, life sciences, design and environmental studies. This chimes with the three key themes for our University's research: health and wellbeing, designing the future, and sustainability, and our DTP students most often work in collaborative research settings within one of these three themes, whether it be designing a light-sheet microscope for live imaging of embryos, or designing new concrete foundations for over-the-horizon wind turbines, or engaged in digital design for elderly citizens. 
Information about research projects across these themes can be found on the web: 
School of Science and Engineering (www.dundee.ac.uk/scienceengineering), 
School of Medicine (medicine.dundee.ac.uk), 
School of Life Sciences (www.lifesci.dundee.ac.uk),
Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design (www.dundee.ac.uk/djcad), 
and on our University main research pages: (www.dundee.ac.uk/main/research) 
Previous research projects funded by the DTP show the diversity of research areas at Dundee which have a foundation in the engineering and physics sciences, for example: biophotonics, computational biophysics, biomedical engineering, biomathematics, concrete technology, geotechnical engineering, solar physics, digital design, and human-computer interactions.
We employ our DTP awards strategically to fund interdisciplinary projects that involve collaborations across disciplines and Schools. We also aim to support projects from our early-career academics. Interested students are encouraged to directly contact individual academic researchers or Associate Deans for Research in the Schools listed above. Decisions on which projects to fund are generally made around March/April with students offered positions in time to start at Dundee in early autumn (September/October).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>887440</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/N509632/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
