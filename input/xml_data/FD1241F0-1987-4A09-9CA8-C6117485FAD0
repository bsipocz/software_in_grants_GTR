In established multi-party systems, levels of electoral turnout and party membership seem to be in terminal decline (Norris 1999; Pharr &amp;amp; Putnam 2000). Additionally, since the popular democratic uprisings which spread across areas of the Middle East and North Africa from 2011, a rising tide of violence and oppression has been witnessed across states that were at the very heart of the &amp;quot;Arab Spring&amp;quot; (Davies 2014). Recent governmental and non-governmental initiatives exhibit a strong drive to improve the strength and vitality of democracy at the local, national, global and virtual levels. From public space occupations and the emergence of 'e-citizenship' to the UK Design Commission's recent research exercise in &amp;quot;Designing Democracy&amp;quot;, there is a prevailing sense that participation in democratic processes can and should be improved. 

Many scholars have placed their hopes for democratic renewal on a civil society that is ever more vocal; and that today articulates its claims across multiple spaces, in multiple ways. One key obstacle however is that governmental bodies have not developed the tools to understand or 'listen' effectively to the myriad forms of political expression that take place across the 'porous' political spaces of the C21st. Additionally, whilst a wide variety of theoretical approaches have been developed to address the strategic dimensions of civil society activities, these literatures have rarely engaged with one another, and there remain crucial oversights in terms of theorising when it comes to political expressions that go beyond 'speech'. Literature linking civil society strategies to the prospects for democratic reinvigoration has been limited in scope, usually resting on traditional assumptions of a world of territorially bounded sovereign nation states - a model that is increasingly contested.

By attending to various gaps in existing research; and by facilitating learning encounters between civil society representatives, public officials and academics, our seminar series will: i) cast a critical scholarly lens on the current 'crisis of democracy' experienced the world over, and ii) explore the ways that civil contentious strategies of the C21st can and do contribute to improving, strengthening or renewing democratic vitality. A key aim of our seminar series is to build public and institutional capacity to effectively understand and engage with new and newly transformed modes of political expression and claim making; a crucial step in strengthening democracy.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our proposed ESRC Seminar Series would seek to make an impact across three principal sectors, each of which has a key stake in enhanced understanding of civil society strategies for democratic renewal:

1. Civil society actors will be able to develop improved knowledge and understanding of both the strategies available to them, and the factors which need to be taken into consideration in order effectively to apply these strategies. Prospective participants from civil society have been identified for every seminar in the case for support. The breadth of civil society actors to be brought together in this series is expansive, including not only formally organised advocacy organizations but also artists' collectives, digitally-mediated networks, and independent activists. These representatives would have the opportunity to learn from deliberation with one another, as well as from engagement with officials and academics. 

2. Public officials, through the seminar series, will gain much needed insight into the ways that they might engage more effectively with civil society members in order to address the challenges to their own democratic legitimacy that have been brought about by contemporary processes of globalisation. 

3. The wider public at local, national, and international levels, constitute the 'demos' that the strategies explored in these seminars are intended to serve. The general public will be engaged not only indirectly, through the civil society and public official participants in the seminars, but also directly though our extensive public engagement strategy outlined in the pathways to impact.

By bringing together stakeholders from civil society, public office, and academia, the series would provide conditions for meaningful engagement between three groups that often talk past each other. Moreover, through its critical discussion of civil society strategies for democratic renewal, it will unearth and illuminate the problems and prospects faced by publics seeking to advance political objectives across local, national, global spaces and virtual spaces.

Through deepening our understanding of the range of democratic strategies available to public officials, civil society organizations, and the general public the seminars will help equip public officials and civil society representatives to address wider contemporary challenges which they face, such as public disillusionment with institutionalized politics reflected in low voter turnout, and the increasing questions being asked in relation to the legitimacy of civil society organizations.

Our seminar series will also serve a crucial function in terms of bringing civil society actors and public officials into dialogue about the challenges that each face in engaging with the other. In this sense, our seminars will act as crucial bridges and learning spaces for non-academic actors.

The means by which civil society actors, public officials, and academics will be brought together in the seminars will extend far beyond traditional formats of seminar engagement such as presentations and commentary: as outlined in the case for support and pathways to impact, engagement will take place through experiential experiments involving novel artistic and media practices.

Moreover, each of the key stakeholders will be informed through our extensive communications strategy, which will involve both traditional and social media aimed at both civil society sectoral and general public audiences.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-04-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>30365</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Multimedia Exhibition 'Art, Expression, Democracy', 23- 29 April 2016, Bank Street Arts,</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E476A3A3-CF11-4C50-904A-9559C174CA0C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A major mixed-media exhibition that was designed to encourage the public to reflect upon the relationship between politics and art in fresh and dynamic ways.

It's intended to provide the broad foundations on which later seminars will be based.

The aims of this seminar are to:

Explore narratives of democratic 'crisis'
Investigate the emergence of new democratic spaces and new participatory repertoires
Identify spaces where opportunities for political expression and dialogue are closing
Examine periods of sudden political change and their legacy effects
Consider the 'nexus' or point of connection between the 'old' and 'new' ways of 'doing politics'
Discuss what is missing from the analysis of democratic change and renewal.
This list, though not exhaustive, provides an indication of the breadth of the canvas that this seminar will be working across.

It invites contributions from multiple disciplines and seeks to draw-out insights from (inter alia) aesthetics, anthropology, social movement and civil society studies, non-violent action, strategic studies, political and social theory, and media analysis to better understand the challenges of democratic renewal in the twenty-first century.

The latter not only acts as a monitoring mechanism of various state activities, and therefore, contributing the system's accountability and transparency, but also works to extend the democratic space continuously in order to include new social groups as political actors in ever-expanding democratic politics. In some cases, civil society confronts the state in a non-violent manner with the objective of pushing the latter towards realizing democratic objectives. However, this liberal democratic balance has been challenged by new democratic movements. From the Occupy to the 15M, new protests movements present what Hardt and Negri call an 'exodos' from the existing system, which has failed 'the 99%'. 'Real Democracy Now', the famous slogan of the 15M, is pertinent to a democratic renewal, which also requires rethinking what civil society means, why 'new civil society' confronts with the state and the system, and how they protest.

Amid the legacy of Gezi Park protests and proximity to both Syntagma protests and the Arab uprisings, this seminar will take place in Turkey with the objective bringing scholars and activists together. The main goal of the seminar is to analyse and rethink what 'confrontation' implies academically and politically in the age of democratic renewal. It has been widely accepted that new mass protests represent a diversity regarding the protestors' subjectivities and identities. This diversity is often reflected upon the collective movement in which new confrontational methods are almost always spontaneously formulated. As governments are often caught unprepared by these novel methods, 'horizontal politics' within the occupied public spaces show signs of a new political consciousness. What kind of legacy this new consciousness would produce, however, is open to the debate. This seminar, therefore, is designed to answer the following questions:

What does confrontation mean for new civil protest movements and governments?
What types of confrontational methods do the protestors formulate?
Where does violence stand in the process of new democratic renewal?
How do the police forces conceive the new protest movements?
What is the importance of 'space' for the new movements?
Under what conditions can social confrontation promote democratic renewal?
How have confrontational strategies changed in the age of social media?</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c7c5ebe03929.98446011</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.crickcentre.org/events/seminar-3-confrontation-protest-and-democratic-progress/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Although the seminars are not completed yet the outputs and impacts are already taking shape.
