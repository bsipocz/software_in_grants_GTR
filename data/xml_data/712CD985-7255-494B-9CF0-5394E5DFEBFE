These organisms complement the digestive capabilities of their host by helping digest complex polysaccharides, participate in the development of the immune system and have an important role in protecting the host from pathogens through competitive exclusion. In turn, the host provides a stable environment and a regular supply of nutrients. However, there is increasing evidence that disorders such as metabolic syndrome, obesity and ulcerative colitis could be associated, at least in part, with imbalances in the microbiota composition. It is therefore crucial to understand the factors that regulate the gut microbiota in order to design interventions to favour the establishment of a health-promoting microbiota. Unfortunately, we have limited knowledge of the precise mechanisms that determine how successfully bacteria will colonise a host. The aim of this project is to identify and characterise the molecular mechanisms that allow commensal bacteria to colonise the lower GI-tract, with particular emphasis on how intestinal inflammation and bacterial competition can influence colonisation. To achieve the aim, we use molecular and genomic approaches in conjunction with conventional and gnotobiotic murine models to identify bacterial genes (functions) that confer a competitive advantage in presence/absence of intestinal inflammation. Using similar methods we will investigate at the molecular level how the presence of specific commensal bacteria in the GI-tract of animal models influences subsequent colonisation by other bacteria.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_PROJECTED</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1439152</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Work associated with this project has been published and is being cited in other scientific publications.

We have finalised our work on comparing Escherichia coli populations isolated from different environments. We identified phenotypes associated with colonisation of the host GI-tract or the plant environment, as well as providing evidence of ecological specialisation. Importantly, we found a strong association between phylogeny and phenotype, demonstrating that E. coli population structure is influenced by niche-specific selective pressures.
2. We successfully set up a pipeline for the generation and analysis of metatranscriptomics data. This approach enables us to determine the gene expression profile of bacteria in their complex natural environment. We applied it to analyse the in vivo gene expression profile of the enteric pathogen Citrobacter rodentium as well as the effects of the infection on the resident gut microbiota.
3.Epidemiology-based approaches can and do provide important information about bacterial populations associated with particular hosts or environments. However, there are important limitations to consider. Characteristics enriched in a given environment could reflect a determinant of fitness in the contaminating host or vehicle rather than in the environment they have been isolated from. Contamination ageing and differences between transient and resident strains are therefore confounding factor that can mask adaptive traits. Epidemiological approaches therefore need being complemented by measuring fitness in the relevant environments, which can be time and labour consuming. To increase throughput we have developed a strategy that enables us to monitor in parallel the fate of several E. coli strains in complex environments such as the gut or relevant to the food chain.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our epidemiological work on E. coli will contribute to gain a better insight on E. coli diversity and its impact on human health. For example, knowing the factors influencing E. coli survival in the external environment might be useful for devising better risk monitoring procedures as it could help explain why the levels of generic E. coli (an indicator of faecal contamination) do not correlate with the presence of pathogens such as Salmonella and E. coli O157:H7. In the longer term this could lead to modified food safety protocols that detect a more representative E. coli subpopulation or particular genomic markers, thus improving the safety of fresh produce with clear societal and economic benefits.
The approaches we have developed will also enable us to better study the factors, such as diet or particular antibiotic treatments, that influence the ability of bacteria to become stable resident of the gut. This knowledge is essential to devise strategies for maintaining/restoring a beneficial host-microbiota association.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>74D08E4C-455E-43F6-912E-10C6C9C2D5A4</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546343b1d06da4.85796748</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8D26EA7D-432E-400B-BA60-8E3A09B26054</gtr:id><gtr:title>Phylogenetic distribution of traits associated with plant colonization in Escherichia coli.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Environmental microbiology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/be1880bca5620d2e1ffc5afb49b42451"><gtr:id>be1880bca5620d2e1ffc5afb49b42451</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>M?ric G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1462-2912</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5459fb7acef4f4.05929450</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7565F32B-0B1C-47ED-9579-85AB39000775</gtr:id><gtr:title>Genome-wide analysis of the H-NS and Sfh regulatory networks in Salmonella Typhimurium identifies a plasmid-encoded transcription silencing mechanism.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Molecular microbiology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/51b36dcf63618ae472262244178c3cdf"><gtr:id>51b36dcf63618ae472262244178c3cdf</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dillon SC</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0950-382X</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5459fb7b25eba0.64647613</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7BB10F5E-7BF9-4306-BCF9-A15D311F27F5</gtr:id><gtr:title>The transcriptional landscape and small RNAs of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/18e256da473b64341ad74b479a048e26"><gtr:id>18e256da473b64341ad74b479a048e26</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kr?ger C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0027-8424</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5459fb7b011068.36073623</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BBS/E/F/00044454</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
