Deaths from liver disease are increasing year on year, and the majority of patients affected are under 60 years. There are a number of underlying causes of liver disease, the commonest being alcohol, viral hepatitis, and fatty liver disease, which is linked to obesity and diabetes. 
Long term damage to the liver results in scarring, a process known as liver fibrosis. In the later stages of liver fibrosis, there is a heavy burden of scar tissue which affects the function of the liver. This is known as cirrhosis, and is associated with a risk of liver failure and cancer. At present, there is no effective anti-fibrotic treatment for liver fibrosis; the only cure is liver transplantation. However, there are already huge shortages in donor livers, and an urgent need for alternative treatments for use at earlier, potentially reversible stages of disease. 

The main cell responsible for producing scar tissue in the liver is the hepatic stellate cell. These cells are normally in a resting state but become 'activated' when the liver is injured. These activated cells produce the components of scar tissue, and are more mobile. They move through the liver, depositing scar tissue as they go. Contact with scar tissue leads to further activation of hepatic stellate cells, and the process of liver fibrosis becomes a vicious cycle. 

Cells sense their environment through receptors on their surface, known as integrins. There are over 20 different integrins identified in humans, and each is made up of an alpha and a beta subunit. We think that activation via integrins is one of the key steps in activation of hepatic stellate cells, and we already have clues that the integrin subunit, beta1 plays a central role. However, this exciting discovery has raised many further questions. For example, we need to know which alpha subunits are important, and at what time during fibrosis beta1 integrin acts. This information is essential in order to choose compounds which block the integrin as potential treatments for liver fibrosis, and in determining whether treatment would be useful in preventing and/or reversing liver fibrosis. My research will investigate these questions: revealing exciting new insights into the underlying mechanisms of liver fibrosis, and identifying compounds with the potential to be developed into new treatments for this devastating disease.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Despite significant progress in defining the molecular basis of liver fibrosis, there are currently no effective anti-fibrotic therapies for clinical use. Activation of quiescent hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) to proliferative myofibroblasts is the crucial step in initiating fibrosis. My preliminary data suggest that Itgb1 signalling plays a central role in HSC activation and liver fibrosis. The objective of my research is to unravel the role of Itgb1 in the development and function of activated HSCs in vitro, and test this in liver fibrosis in vivo. This will extend to testing whether small molecule integrin antagonists can block liver fibrosis in animal models.

My specific aims are:
1. Define the temporal importance of Itgb1 during HSC activation in vitro
2. Identify the alpha-subunit(s) interacting with Itgb1 in activated HSCs
3. Define the temporal importance of Itgb1 during the onset of liver fibrosis in mice

Methodology: I will utilise the techniques of immunoblotting, immunocytochemistry, expression microarray, real time-PCR, histology staining with haemotoxylin and eosin and Sirius red, cell transfection and co-immunoprecpitation. In vivo work will utilise Itgb1fl/fl;GFAPCreER+/- mice for conditional deletion of Itgb1 by intraperitoneal tamoxifen injection; before during and after induction of liver fibrosis by intraperitoneal CCl4 injection or bile duct ligation. 

Potential Scientific and Medical Outcome: Defining the role of Itgb1 signalling, and the effects of its blockade, will be a major advancement in our understanding of the pathophysiology of liver disease. Uncovering therapeutic potential for integrin-targeting compounds would be very exciting: there is an urgent need for anti-fibrotic agents, and discovering a new avenue for drug development would give hope to patients suffering with this condition, and clinicians frustrated by the lack of treatment options.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Liver disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, and clinicians are limited in the available treatment options: currently there are no approved anti-fibrotic therapies. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying liver fibrosis, and the identification of potential new therapeutic targets would benefit patients with liver disease, hepatologists and other clinical staff involved in their care. 

As this is pre-clinical research it would likely be many years before drugs arising from discoveries made here, were available for clinical use; nevertheless, this is still important. However, it remains possible that this research may highlight potential new applications for drugs already in clinical use, in which case, time scales would be much shorter. Results of this research may be commercially exploitable; e.g. my supervisors hold a UK patent PCT/GB2008/050354 (also filed in the USA) for modulating SOX9 expression as a treatment for fibrosis and related conditions.

The availability of anti-fibrotic agents and the potential to arrest or reverse the fibrotic process would necessitate further planning for the screening and management of patients with liver disease, or with the potential to develop liver disease. The results and implications of this research may therefore potentially be of interest to public health physicians. 

More broadly, new discoveries in the field of liver fibrosis may assist in advancing knowledge of the fibrotic process in other organs. As such, other patient and clinician groups may also benefit in the longer term. 

Finally, the research and transferable skills I will develop during this programme of research will enhance my professional development, enabling me to take the next steps towards becoming an independent researcher.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-10-16</gtr:end><gtr:funder
