Birkbeck is a place where we connect, collaborate, challenge received wisdom and build on the expertise of life and work, as well as official, knowledges. We see our public engagement as sitting within the heart of our values, as a core part of research, enabling us to interact with a wide and diverse range of people for the betterment of our research and our researchers. In order to realize the full potential of our vision for public engagement, the College requires a step change in strategic activity focusing mainly on building sustained infrastructure, with a secondary focus on reward and recognition. 

The Birkbeck Researchers' Engagement Development project (BRED) will enable Birkbeck to drive culture change. It will do so by building on the Birkbeck Strategy and Plan for Public Engagement, and by strengthening the existing team, as well as adopting a number of new initiatives. We will appoint additional expertise in the form of a PER Evaluation Officer and a PER Coordinator. 

The PER Evaluation Officer will assist Birkbeck in the development of a systematic approach to evaluating PER activities - both at the level of the institutional strategy and at the level of individual research projects - and is therefore essential in a PER team. Systematic evaluation will ensure quality and enable the College to maximise its efforts in PER. 

The establishment of a PER Coordinator will enable Birkbeck to organize systematic training programmes for all researchers at Birkbeck; it will also enable Birkbeck to develop and manage a number of schemes to recognize and reward staff engaged in PER, including the PER Awards and PER Seed Funding. In addition seed funding and PER awards will enable the College to demonstrate what we believe good quality engagement to be.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Birkbeck researchers who engage with the PER training, awards and seed funding schemes will be the immediate beneficiaries of the BRED programme. They will learn new ways of working and gain valuable skills which will translate back and enrich their future research endeavours. We will particularly focus on nurturing and encouraging our engaged researchers to showcase their accomplishments; we anticipate that this will therefore encourage others to follow in their footsteps, creating a virtuous circle and driving the desired culture change articulated in the call text. 

In addition, the BRED project will generate a resource of reports and recorded material, including novel engagement mechanisms and resources on engagement best practice that will be available both within the College and across the sector beyond the end of the project. This guidance will be most relevant to small and specialist institutions, who are institutions who have generally sat outside the Beacons/Catalysts framework in the past and as such this will be a particularly valuable contribution to the HE sector.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>48366</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R019649/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
