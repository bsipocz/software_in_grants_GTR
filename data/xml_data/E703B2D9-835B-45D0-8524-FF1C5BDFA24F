Whilst the consequential packaging of processing power into high performance units has suited the development many electronic systems, such as computers, where processing power is naturally concentrated, it does not suit the future aim of ubiquitous computing. In a ubiquitous computing world, processing power is distributed at a low level to the places where it is required. The consequence of this is that humans no longer interact with specific electronic devices to engage with the digital world, but are constantly connected in an intuitive way that is open to all - a view that is expressed through the recent 'Digital Britain' reports.This will require the development of a new technology that allows high performance electronic devices (such as transistors) to be fabricated at very low cost on a diversity of cheap substrates including plastics. There are several technologies vying for this space, including thin film silicon, organic semiconductors and metal oxides. Each have their relative merits and demerits, and it is clear that no single technology will dominate, but rather that different technologies will address different application areas depending on the specific requirements (performance, lifetime, cost, operating environment, etc.). Metal oxide materials will have a clear role to play in this space as they offer particular features that the other technologies do not - most notably (and simultaneously) transparency, high carrier mobility, an amorphous structure, excellent uniformity and long lifetimes. However, in order to meet these applications, it is necessary to be able to marry metal oxide materials with a low cost patterning technology. To achive this will require a combination of diverse skills from materials characterisation to device testing and failure analysis. It is for this reason that the the Departments of Materials Science and Engineering will be collaborating on this project.This project will see the University continue to develop its expertise in the deposition of a diversity of metal oxide materials including n-type semiconductors (zinc oxide, indium zinc oxide and zinc tin oxide), p-type semiconductors (cuprous oxide) and insulators (hafnium oxide and aluminium oxide). These materials will be applied in a variety of discrete electronic devices, logic devices and circuits using a novel self-aligned patterning technology based on printing techniques. The University will then plug into a complete supply chain of UK companies through the wider project partners.As a consortium, we will develop a sheet-based process to provide printed logic components which will be employed to demonstrate and open up new application areas of distributed logic (ubiquitous computing). This will focus on interactive consumer products that allow brand enhancement, brand protection and improved product choice.Achieving this will require the University to research some very fundamental aspects of the physics, materials science and engineering of metal oxide materials. In particular, the nature of the band structure of metal oxides makes it very difficult to produce a stable, p-type semiconductor. The nature of the interface between metal oxide materials - particularly between semiconductors and dielectrics and between semiconductors and conductors, both of which are key for a functional device - is not well understood. There are numerous reports of a variety of degradation mechanisms operating in these materials, particularly under the application of elevated temperatures and under ultraviolet light illumination, but no consensus on degradation mechanisms. The University will aim to address these key issues to enable the project partners to utilise the metal oxide materials successfully within the time frame of the project.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-04-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>425664</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>5597150</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>EPSRC Centre for Innovative manufacturing in Large Area Electronics</gtr:description><gtr:end>2018-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>EP/K03099X/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>6AEBB0E4-DE02-44FA-831A-8E345175094D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5edc42245edc4238</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>56503</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Technology Strategy Board Contract Research &amp;amp; Development</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-06-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Technology Strategy Board (TSB)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>TS/M009645/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>801C23C9-E462-46BE-B024-873D81EE994B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5460f6bbb9d9e3.94111464</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>This project was the basis for developing our research on thin film oxide semiconductors.

As such, the industrial partners cover the complete supply chain. PlasmaQuest Ltd. produce deposition systems for high rate sputtering of metal oxides. Keithley Instruments manufacture test and measurement equipment for electronic device characterisation. Epigem Ltd. have experience in embossing for device patterning and high-resolution circuitry. Optek Ltd. specialise in laser ablation and dicing, in addition to engineering solutions for handling small components. Finally Pragmatic Printing work in the field of printed logic devices.

The result of this collaboration has been to develop a new generation of very low cost logic devices. This has been based upon metal oxide materials, as they are capable of delivering high performance electronic devices over large areas with low production cost by bringing together the correct deposition and patterning technologies. The University has played an active role in four key areas of this project: material development, device design, device fabrication and device testing. This diversity has been made possible by collaboration between the Departments of Engineering and Materials Science, and the complementary skills that reside in each institution.

This translated into the following results:

1) Materials objectives:

 a) Optimisation of an n-type metal oxide based on ZnO with a crystalline and an electron field effect mobility of 2 cm2/Vs deposited by high rate atomic layer deposition (HR-ALD) at 150 C.

 b) Optimisation of two n-type metal oxides based on sputter-deposited indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO) with a field effect mobility of 2 cm2 V-1 s-1 and on high target utilisiation sputter (HiTUS)-deposited zinc tin oxide (ZTO) with a field-effect mobility of 10 cm2 V-1 s-1. In both cases, deposition is carried out without substrate heating. Both materials are believed to have an amorphous structure.

 c) Optimisation of contact materials on IGZO for source-drain contacts with minimal parasitic impedance.

 d) Optimisation of a p-type metal oxide based on HITUS-deposited cuprous oxide with a Hall mobility of 10 cm2 V-1 s-1 and based on HR-ALD with a Hall mobility of 5 cm2 V-1 s-1.

 e) Process conditions for both alumina and hafnia deposition by HITUS were transferred to PlasmaQuest Ltd. for scale-up to large areas.

 f) High growth rate deposition of alumina at 100 C by HR-ALD.

2) Device design:

 a) Contribution to the development of device structures employed by Pragmatic Printing through supply of CAD files for thin film transistor layouts.

3) Device fabrication:

 a) Fabrication of 'stand-alone' thin film transistors using the materials optimised in objective (1) and structures optimised in objective (2).

 b) Fabrication of simple NMOS inverters using ZTO and alumina.

4) Device testing:

 a) Testing of individual devices and logic devices. Lifetime testing at elevated temperatures of TFTs was carried out and a new testing protocol developed to identify degradation and failure mechanisms.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Transistors based on crystalline silicon have dominated as the technology underpinning logic devices for the last fifty years, and the microprocessor is the ultimate example of this.

 The aim of the work being conducted by Cambridge University through this project has a clear focus on enabling the industrial partners involved to realise commercial success using metal oxide materials for electronic logic device applications on low cost (plastic) substrates. By 2028 this area is expected to achieve a similar share as today's silicon logic ~&amp;pound;65B (33%). 

Particularly close links have been fostered between PlasmaQuest Ltd. (PQL) and Cambridge University. PQL have developed a novel sputter deposition technology which can be applied to a wide range of materials. Through a Cambridge Integrated Knowledge Centre grant, it has previously been possible to install a PQL deposition system in the Clean Facility in Cambridge, which it dedicated to testing the tool for the deposition of metal oxide materials for large-area electronic applications. Frequent meetings and sharing of technical data has led not only to high quality, peer-reviewed journal publications, but also to the sharing of deposition information for different material systems to allow the work performed in the University to be transferred to PQL.

The University has worked with PragmatIC Printing Ltd. (PPL) on the development and testing of the logic devices that PPL will commercialise. In collaboration with Keithley Instruments, we have set up a semi-automatic probe station which PPL have been using for advanced device testing, including capacitance characterisation. PPL staff have also been working in the University's Clean Facility to fabricate devices. They have then transferred processes to their pilot production line.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4A9B9A81-85F7-4514-A635-11133854124B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-653819619.355555377653ee0</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Electronics</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>22A78BE8-A1EF-432D-B77A-AD1AA9767898</gtr:id><gtr:title>Novel Atmospheric Growth Technique to Improve Both Light Absorption and Charge Collection in ZnO/Cu
