&lt;p>&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research?

- A catalyst network of Challenge Partner middle leaders in 17 schools.
- Middle leaders in each of the hub schools supported by this core group. 
- Teachers in their schools involved in the trialling and, through extension, many others.
- Senior leaders in these schools (headteachers and deputy/assistant headteachers).
- Pupils in these schools will be the ultimate beneficiaries, once practice changes are embedded beyond this project's timeline.
- A wider group of Challenge Partner middle leaders (in 180+ schools in total), as the process is developed and extended, capacity is rolled out and best practice exchanged more widely.
- Leaders of other national networks (for example, Teaching School Alliances) engaged in in-school and school-to-school support and improvement, where lessons learnt from our approach will have salience.
- Policy leaders such as the DfE and the National College for School Leadership that has a brief to grow leadership potential and capacity within the self-improving school system, including that of middle leaders. 
- Ourselves as researchers, facilitators and practice partners.

How will they benefit from this research?

A core group of Challenge Partner middle leaders will benefit by who will benefit from intensive capacity building, enabling them to: 
- reflect on and analyse own practice in order to understand what makes it effective and be able to articulate this to others
- relate their practice-based knowledge to what is known about excellent middle leadership / leadership for learning
- support colleagues within and across schools to bring about change and improvements in their practice
- track the differences they make to their and colleagues' practice and, ultimately, pupil learning
- share new knowledge across a wider network of colleagues in similar roles to extend and build capacity.

Participating colleagues and senior leaders in the core group of 17 schools will benefit by having evidence of:
- what excellent middle leadership of teaching and learning 'looks like'
- what middle leaders can do to bring about improvements in practice within their own departments, and more broadly within and across schools
- 'what works' in terms of excellent classroom practice; ie, how to ensure that changes in practice make a positive difference to outcomes for pupils
- how middle leaders can work most effectively to share their knowledge and practice with colleagues in similar roles
- the kinds of supporting condition that need to be in place to establish and sustain cultures of shared outstanding practice.

The wider network of Challenge Partner Schools will benefit by having evidence of how to:
- develop excellent middle leadership of teaching and learning
- ensure improved practice is modelled and articulated effectively and that it makes a difference to outcomes for pupils
- embed improvement in teacher practice through sustainable networking.

Leaders of other networks nationally (including, for example, Teaching School Alliances) engaged in in-school and school-to-school support and improvement, and those operating a system level (such as the DfE, NCSL etc.) will have evidence of:

- what constitutes excellent school-to-school support
- how to develop and support middle leaders and specialist leaders of education (SLEs) so that their work makes a difference to colleagues' practice and outcomes for pupils
- how to build capacity for and sustain collaboration within schools and across clusters, networks and alliances.

As researchers, facilitators, and practice partners we will benefit in:

- enhancing our partnership of academics working with schools and networks
- enriching the ways we can support future middle leaders, due to the accruing two-way benefits from animating the knowledge, our overall engagement in the project and from key lessons stemming from its evaluation.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>51991</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Rektorprogram - leadership development in Norway</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>93123EC1-CBFC-42E2-A3FE-CFB50B5DCD52</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The presentation included a task to get the leaders thinking about identifying and growing distributed leaders - change catalysts - in their own contexts

Here is one example of a response emailed to me afterwards:

&amp;quot;I think that they could be a very powerful Continuing Professional Development (CPD) tool and I can see so many uses for them:

? Engaging staff in school improvement discussions, but in a way that is interesting and stimulating
? Stimulating discussion amongst under performing staff, or those lacking in confidence
? Heads of Faculty coaching their staff to develop effective practice
? Nurturing a desire to engage with academic literature for staff at any level
? Leadership team conferences/residentials - stimulating discussion that is fresh and teacher centred, but rooted in established theory

I could go on. In short I think that schools will be able to use them in a variety of ways that will be stimulating, interesting and extremely useful. They would provide a fresh approach to CPD and they could easily be used to facilitate differentiated sessions. I can see that they would have an impact on school improvement processes, largely because they support a research and development model as well as facilitating coaching practices.

The project findings have been used thus far by three groups:

1. By Challenge Partners (CP) and some of their schools - The CEO and Managing Director of our partner organisation, a charity owned by schools, have told us that it has profoundly affected their thinking and, therefore, how they support all of their hubs/clusters of schools. Since the project started, CP has grown by 300%, with now over 360 schools serving 200,000 students. The work is included in CP's induction programme for new hubs of schools (around 6 a year) and they are required to produce an action plan which CP works with them to deliver over three years. It is also being incorporated into a toolkit to all staff used by CP to support schools through their national brokerage service which, the CEO says, 'is a major development for us'. Last year they received over 300 requests for the service and they expect this to increase considerably over the next few years. The professional learning cards are being trialled by a range of CP's schools. The R&amp;amp;D project and its findings have been included in a range of the CEO's national presentations, frequently attended by policy makers, and is on his website which is accessed by educators from across the globe. His first international reference to the project was last year and this continues. In summary, in the CEO's words, the collaborative project we have undertaken together and its findings are 'of considerable value to us'. Further reporting of CP's use of the project findings will be incorporated in a jointly written and presented paper at the International Congress for School Effectiveness and Improvement in January 2016.

2. By the catalysts themselves, most of their schools and in various networks - Most catalysts have continued to use different elements of the project. Notably, in follow up telephone conversations with some catalysts, it is clear they consider it extremely important to track their impact and help others do the same. Most are still utilising the impact tracking tool, some of them adapting it for other purposes. Different aspects of the project knowledge on middle leadership, educational change, knowledge exchange and networking within and between schools have also influenced their practice and are being shared with colleagues in and beyond their schools. Many of the ideas have been integrated into their everyday leadership practice. In one person's words, 'it's just become part of my mindset'. As almost all of their schools are now in a number of different networks and partnerships beyond Challenge Partners, these findings are also rippling through into catalysts' work in other collaborative initiatives. Some of the schools have also taken up the impact tracking aspect more broadly across the whole staff. The findings on impact on catalysts are further described in a chapter being published in 2016 in an international handbook on professional learning communities (Stoll et al, forthcoming).

3. By knowledge exchange professionals and other professional development facilitators working in collaboration with schools - Although we are not requested to report on how project findings are being used by academia, our knowledge exchange professionals and other professional development facilitators we work with are now using the findings to inform the design of tailored middle and senior educational leadership programmes. The findings have also influenced our work with a significant number of schools and networks of schools interested in evidence-informed practice, for example through the Institute of Education's R&amp;amp;D network of schools, and the Educational Endowment Foundation's funding of Research Learning Communities (primary schools) described elsewhere on researchfish. The professional learning resource cards which we are co-designing with Challenge Partners are being trialled with extremely positive initial feedback and great interest in accessing them to support evidence-informed practice development. In summary, the findings are reaching other schools and being used by them in a range of tasks they engage in as part of programme, projects and network activities with Institute of Education staff.

Given the challenges we elaborated in our final report, this is encouraging. There has been tremendous commitment on the part of both partners to keep the project and its legacy alive, with a number of follow-up meetings and calls. 

Once the prototype professional learning cards have been verified, we anticipate considerably wider use of the project findings in England and internationally to support behaviour change of middle leaders and teachers they work with and, consequently, public service improvement.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>14AAF30A-C7A6-4686-8CBD-F436988B77CA</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>560bb1c12f7977.75451946</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Our main achievements from this knowledge exchange project include: 

1.Catalysts have learnt how to lead educational change in a theory-rich way. Introducing a range of research perspectives on the nature of change itself proved highly significant. This immediately resonated with middle leaders and appeared to be quickly internalised by many of them. They consistently drew on it throughout the project, weaving it into workshop conversations and tasks between sessions. They also reported on resulting successes, and were keen to share what they had learnt about change leadership with other middle leaders in their regional hubs and elsewhere. In essence, they had an increasingly sophisticated understanding of their own role as catalysts for change in relation to the project's theory of action about knowledge exchange. 

2.Catalysts have learnt robust approaches to tracking impact, and enabled others to do the same (Research Question 3). Supported by us, they designed research-informed impact tools that they found powerful in helping stimulate and track changes in colleagues' practice and which were focused on improvements in pupils' learning. Impact measures were contextualised to specific situations and issues, but the enquiry processes always included a baseline against which impact could be judged. They also crafted questions which helped to open up meaningful learning conversations between them and colleagues. This seemed to shift the emphasis from accountability of colleagues to their professional development. Catalysts described changes in colleagues' practice and greater openness to change because the process helped build ownership. A considerable number planned to use the tools again this year in different situations, and some had influenced senior leaders to embed them within school development plans. 

3.We can offer greater understanding about what happens when educational practitioners combine research findings with their own knowledge and experience to generate new knowledge. Operationalising Nonaka and Takeuchi's (1995) theory about knowledge-creating companies in educational settings, embellished with our own theory about learning conversations (Stoll, 2012) has provided insights into the meaning of evidence-informed practice and how it can be achieved. We also know more about how to convey research findings in ways which are are more likely to be incorporated into middle leaders' practice. This includes the relationship between researchers and practitioners and has implications for the meaning of knowledge exchange between researchers and practitioners. 

4.Certain catalysts developed the skills and confidence to engage colleagues in powerful ways as they exchanged their new knowledge within their schools and across regional hubs and/or other networks (Research question 2). They used what they learnt about networking, change, effective middle leadership, impact evaluation and Challenge Partners' models to design collegial learning processes and strategies, or used or adapted ours. Headteachers of these catalysts were very pleased with the changes they had instigated, and further network activities were planned and are ongoing. In less successful instances, either their own immediate context (Research Question 4) or their own middle leadership capabilities or experience (Research Question 1) limited the reach and depth of their impact.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Key advocates and champions will be the catalysts themselves, who are continuing to move their new knowledge around their schools, hubs and other networks. In relation to our publication plans, as well as our pathways to impact plans, we have already arranged to write jointly with two catalysts and have offered others opportunities to write with us and present or co-facilitate at sessions.

We are presenting our findings internationally, have been discussing our findings with colleagues in the US and Canada and are working on an international research bid to take forward the knowledge exchange research.

An unanticipated impact pathway was that Challenge Partners (CP) are now further developing their research engagement and are very keen to collaborate in jointly planning an evidence-informed leadership programme. This will be an important and high-profile development opportunity, as many CP lead schools are also national teaching schools which have a significant leadership role in the education system. The programme will incorporate the findings, be offered throughout the partnership, and will also develop research-enriched change catalyst capacity. 

While these are findings from education, they are pertinent to impact tracking and knowledge exchange in other sectors and could be adapted.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>FC1ED23B-5759-4A1B-AB1F-4495B846A5DE</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54940dfe4644a4.91004821</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.lcll.org.uk/middle-leaders-change-catalysts.html</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Induction programme for hubs joining Challenge Partners</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7D78A2B0-1D9B-407B-872D-CA81E0D37937</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>560bba089b3db2.70548268</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Input into Mayor of London's education programme for teaching schools</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>427B75FC-C6BF-49C8-81EA-578CC950FB05</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>560bbab8f22473.37772380</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2FEC1CD7-757D-4F85-A1E4-40170644DD38</gtr:id><gtr:title>Impact-focused change catalysts: leadership within and across professional learning communities</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/694501b2c8a3b7ae490b9ffbc509b833"><gtr:id>694501b2c8a3b7ae490b9ffbc509b833</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Stoll L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>545ca7638d77c9.03591496</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7CED3B0A-01E7-49DD-8D96-6429EC30D744</gtr:id><gtr:title>Perspectives on teacher leadership for evidence-informed improvement in England</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Leading &amp; Managing</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/cbc0cb536a7cedb1f4370c6522270327"><gtr:id>cbc0cb536a7cedb1f4370c6522270327</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Stoll, L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>560bb3c724d6e0.14995301</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7C097CA7-29F7-47C5-B023-1AEA500D168E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Middle leaders as catalysts for evidence-informed change</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ee002d8a792607a7ce6a4d346a7fac25"><gtr:id>ee002d8a792607a7ce6a4d346a7fac25</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Stoll L and Brown C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-78277-111-1</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>545c9e0bdde342.68963536</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/L002043/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F9D6F76D-4C6C-4E36-8E06-D471DED87098</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EE390962-5CA1-4D76-A6D5-A303DED717E8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Knowledge Management</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>39B8C78D-8933-4158-88D3-165B9F15A254</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Leadership</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
