children with Autism, Dyslexia, or ADHD?</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/K003356/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>The number of children diagnosed with childhood developmental disorders, including autism and attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), has risen sharply in over the last twenty years.The big question is why?&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>Is it because there are really more children with the symptoms that underpin autism and ADHD? &lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Or is it solely due to increasing awareness, and changing diagnostic criteria and practice?&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>This project uses secondary data analysis of two UK cohorts a decade apart to examine whether there really are more childen with&amp;nbsp; symptoms of autism and ADHD in recent times. It will assess whether severity of symptoms has increased over ten years, relative to the number of children with diagnosis; or if, as expected, symptoms levels have remained constant with diagnosis increasing.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Second, the study will examine whether boys are more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD, even when girls have similar difficulties.Thus it will detect any bias to identify boys with ADHD, perhaps linked to gender stereotypes surrounding the disorder.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Finally, the study will test whether children have co-occurring symptoms of developmental disorders. The study will characterise children with reading difficulties (dyslexia), analysing how frequently they have hyperactive behaviours or autistic-type difficulties.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project will benefit educators, clinicians and policymakers as well as raising these issues more widely. A radio programme based on research findings will be produced and distributed online.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The beneficiaries of the research reflect the interdisciplinary nature of this collaboration:

1) Epidemiologists, social scientists

2) Clinicians and educational psychologists

3) Health policy makers, such as those involved in diagnostic guidelines (e.g. American Psychiatric Association, World Health Organisation; Research funding bodies (e.g. NIHR, MRC, ESRC); educational psychology bodies issuing guidelines (e.g. the British Psychological Society).

4) ADHD and ASD charities and support groups, parents, relatives, affected adults and children.

How will they benefit from this research?
The proposed work will contribute to the evidence base that informs epidemiologists about the nature of potential underlying causes of diagnosis of autism, ADHD and dyslexia. If symptom levels are increasing over the study period, explanatory risk factors that have changed in the recent past, be they social, environmental, gene/environmental, family-based or educational factors, are potential targets for intervention and or prevention and are therefore important to identify. It will also inform sociologists about the extent to which symptomatic behaviours of ASD and ADHD have become medicalised (under the medical domain) over the recent past.

For clinicians and educational psychologists, findings will highlight characteristics such as gender and cognitive ability that influence which groups of children are more likely to be bought to the clinic, informing them about which children slip through diagnostic nets, and why. This research will expose the influence of gender, cognitive ability and social factors on diagnostic practices, as opposed to direct diagnosis by symptoms of each condition.

Overlap in symptoms between conditions will benefit bodies that set diagnostic criteria such as the American Psychiatric Association and World Health Organisation as they examine the validity of current diagnostic categories. Research funding bodies (e.g. National Institute of Health Research, NIHR) will be informed about whether funding the search for underlying environmental causal factors of these disorders should be prioritised. Our findings, particularly concerning dyslexia will also be of interest to educational psychology bodies issuing guidelines (e.g. the British Psychological Society), because they will shed light on how their current definition of dyxlexia (which does not require a discrepancy between IQ and reading ability) are currently implemented. This has consequences for which children are classified as dyslexic. All of the above institutions will be targeted through 2-page policy briefs, issued through the ESRC Centre for Genomics in Society, where the PI will be based for 40% of her time. 

The project will provide information for parents and affected individuals too, improving understandings of ASD, ADHD or dyslexia diagnosis in terms of their historical context. According to parents that have taken part in previous studies, it will also help them assess the merits of diagnosis and meet their need for broad information when assessing recommendations of educators and clinicians. Parents, and parent-led charities will directly benefit because they will be better informed about links between diagnosis and symptoms for children. This has been a major source of debate and mobilisation of parent groups and the findings will be communicated to these actors through targeted press releases again referring to academic publications that result.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>168753</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Bergen</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Norway, Kingdom of</gtr:country><gtr:description>USEA</gtr:description><gtr:id>790D70A9-176A-473E-837A-D348E1BDAEB5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We are applying for funding for a first meeting</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>546361b09e23d3.55658112-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Helping with invitations, discussion of what the group will do</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We are setting up a UK-Scandi Epidemiology of autism group (USEA)</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Toronto</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Canada</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration on book chapter about DSM-5 and autism</gtr:description><gtr:id>85DB998D-5B5D-484F-AFF9-2C58685EA241</gtr:id><gtr:impact>'Challenging Psychiatric Diagnosis: Autism and neurodiversity'.

? Promoted wide debate amongst adults with autism 
? led to changes in public understandings of ADHD 
? Had an influence on training and practice of Special Educational Needs teachers
? led to engagement with clinical audiences (child psychiatrists, paediatricians) 

This was achieved through a series of activities, including but not limited to discussion on web-sites (refs 2-4 below), and use of Dr Russell's research in autism specific information and discussion sites (1,4). Changes in public understandings of ADHD were achieved through Via media coverage and debate (9-12)? Dyslexia -the influence on training and practice of Special Educational Needs teachers was achieved via publications for practitioners and parents (13-15)
Finally engagement with clinical audiences (child psychiatrists, paediatricians) was delivered via talks and continued professional development seminars for paediatricians and psychiatrists (5-9)

The research carried out on this grant has used autism, ADHD and dyslexia to illustrate issues around diagnosis showing
 i) That for autism, time trends show number of children with diagnosis have increased over the last ten years, but this is paralleled by a larger proportion of children who apparently have symptoms of autism. The findings are controversial as they suggest there is an increase in the number of children with autistic-types of behaviours. So increased diagnosis is not simply due to rising awareness of autism. 
 ii) The validity of diagnostic categories 'autism' 'dyslexia' and 'ADHD' as discrete conditions are in doubt as symptoms of all these conditions often co-occur. Our findings show that reading difficulties may have a troubling impact in areas other than achievement in school work. The children with specific word reading difficulties displayed increased levels on a broad spectrum of behavioural difficulties, having greater difficulties with peer relationships and more emotional and conduct problems. 
iii) Attention deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) diagnosis is influenced by socio-economic context in upbringing. This suggests that although ADHD is primarily though of a condition with genetic/neurological origins, social factors also have a role in its aetiology. I am continuing to work on this aspect of the project, looking at putative mechanisms that might explain this association.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>i) The work means novel environmental risk factors may be to blame for the increasing prevalence of autistic-type behaviours. So the implication for research is to put more emphasis on finding the causal route: exploring whether novel pre- or peri natal factors might be contributing to the rise in the number of children with autism.
This information will be of use to medical research funders in the field.
ii) Instead of applying a narrow diagnosis, such as 'dyslexia' or 'attention deficit disorder', our results suggest it might be better to look at a child's problems much more broadly. Any child with either of these diagnoses, (or other developmental disorder diagnosis) may be prone to other difficulties. The findings can be applied to best assessment practice (either by educational psychologist at school, psychiatrist, paediatrician or Special Educational Needs Coordinator (teacher) recognizes each child's difficulties both at home and at school, in behaviour as well as in classroom work. Ideal assessment includes children's practical abilities to cope with day-to-day life and real world situations as well as how well they do academically. 
This has been expanded on in non-academic publications, for example the National Association of Special Educational Needs Co-ordinators (NASEN) magazine, 'Special'.
iii) The findings concerning ADHD diagnosis and its relationship to socio-economic disadvantage have led to a fully funded doctoral studentship for Abigail Higgins. This is on-going and includes an assessment of the potential mechanisms through which this relationship operates. She is also conducting a study in the epigenetics of ADHD, work that examines whether the social world leaves a biological footprint. The work developed has been a direct consequence of the ESRC
