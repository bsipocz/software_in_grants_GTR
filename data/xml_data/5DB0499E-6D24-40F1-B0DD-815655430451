This is reflected in the style of parliamentary politics at Westminster, in which an elected government is opposed by the 'Official Opposition'. Debate tends to move between the two. Observers of the weekly Prime Minister's Question Time will see a prime demonstration of this, when the leader of the Official Opposition is granted the privilege of speaking from the dispatch box (something which is denied to the leaders of all other parties), and has the opportunity to ask up to six questions to the Prime Minister. The leader of the second opposition party receives two questions. Smaller opposition parties receive no such guarantee of a question. This two party dominance is therefore reinforced by parliamentary procedures, which grant greater speaking time as well as committee memberships to the largest opposition party. 

But small parties have played pivotal roles throughout nineteenth and twentieth century UK politics. They have become even more popular in the twenty first century as the appeal of the large parties has waned amidst a somewhat disillusioned electorate. The Labour Party and the Conservative party were regularly polling over 90% of the vote in the mid twentieth century, but managed only 67% in 2015.This gap is being filled by smaller parties, of which over 300 are currently registered with the UK Electoral Commission. These parties are contesting more seats than ever before in local elections and, crucially, they are winning a significant number of seats in national elections, to the UK Parliament and the devolve assemblies of Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Ten political parties were represented in the House of Commons after the 2015 General Election, with a total of 85 MPs between them (accounting for 13% of the chamber). In fact, 2015 saw the best General Election performance ever for UKIP, the SNP and the Green Party. This fell to only 6 parties in the 2017 general election, but the unexpected hung parliament has seen one small party (the DUP) and has potentially empowered all other small parties in the chamber. In addition to this presence at Westminster, 19 parties have representation in the UK's sub national parliaments. Although the sub-national parliaments of the UK have more consensual practices, existing research still proceeds as though the 'opposition' is one parliamentary grouping. As such we still know little about the role of individual parties in these parliaments. But there has been an almost complete neglect of the role of individual small parties within these parliaments. 

This three year project aims to better understand the work of small political parties in the British House of Commons, the Northern Ireland Assembly, Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly. It uses large scale interviews with MPs and assembly members and analysis of key parliamentary documents, debates, questions and amendments to pieces of legislation since 2015 to investigate the role which small parties play in our political system. In doing so, in considers the challenges they face in parliamentary institutions and the impact they are able to make on scrutiny of government and of legislation. In doing so, it will highlight an area of parliamentary life which is usually hidden, uncovering best practice which will be shared with parliamentary officials, MPs and staff.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The primary beneficiaries of this research are parliamentary practitioners, political party staff and elected representatives working within Westminster and the devolved parliaments. These individuals are responsible for promoting, supporting or integrating the work of small political parties into the everyday work of parliamentary politics. The general public are a secondary audience. This will include those seeking information about the role and work of small parties. This audience is both UK wide and region-specific, depending on the political party and institution in question. The status of the general public as potential beneficiary will increase considerably shortly before, and during, parliamentary elections. Although scheduled for 2021 (Wales, Scotland) and 2022 (UK) they may well take place during the research period itself. A third beneficiary are parliamentary correspondents working within the four legislatures. Correspondents will be interested in the day-to-day work of small parties, particularly around key events or votes in the chambers. Most importantly, they are key mediators as they communicate the work of parliament and its members to a broader media audience. 

The research is designed to maximise the potential for the project to appeal to these beneficiaries. Most importantly, its direction will be influenced by the relevant parliamentary practitioners who will help to co-design the research. These key stakeholders will be involved form the very beginning of the project, acting as gatekeepers but also ensuring that the project aligns well with parliamentary and committee interests, as well as with any forthcoming committee inquiries. This will provide a firm foundation for the research to have impact. 

As would be expected, the planned dissemination activities are based heavily around practitioners. The PI will apply for a House of Commons Parliamentary Fellowship at the start of the project. This will facilitate access to practitioners and facilitate the participation of parliamentary staff at Westminster with the research. Research findings will be presented at the leading parliamentary workshops in the discipline (e.g. the Study of Parliament Group Annual Conference). The highlight of the research dissemination is the end of project workshop. This workshop plays a key role in bringing academic and practitioner beneficiaries together and in encouraging discussions in a cross-institutional setting. This will be an effective way to encourage changes to better integrate small parties. 

Alongside this academic and practitioner dissemination sits an ongoing, but less structured set of dissemination activities aimed at the general public. To be most effective, dissemination in this area needs to be planned around specific events in the four parliaments, or in UK Politics. The PI will use well known existing media outlets (e.g. The Conversation) with a large existing reader base to promote the research to the wider public when relevant. Opportunities for dissemination are likely to be much greater around the time of parliamentary elections in 2021/22 and this timing fits neatly with the end of the planned period of research. The strategy here will be responsive to issues as they arise on the political agenda, but it is likely to include issues such as the impact of small parties on specific policy areas, the benefits (or not) of voting for small party candidates and the likelihood of smaller parties being electorally successful. The flexibility built into the project, with a staggered approach to the study of each legislature and the selection of case study bills being carried out following research interviews, the research will be able to be adapted to take account of any unanticipated changes, or any new issues in the parliaments being studied.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>236287</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/R005915/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F7EEE6CD-E283-4BAB-BA5E-70B4B0F1F1A6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5BAFFA07-4055-4FE0-BE2D-FF47ECC4B6BF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Politics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
