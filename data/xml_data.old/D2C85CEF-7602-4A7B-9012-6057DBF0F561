Compared to human designed metaheuristics, these will be better, faster and stronger. Pilot studies indicate they will perform better than human designed metaheuristics, as we are using them as a starting point. They will be designed faster than via the manual design process. We will able to make stronger statistical statements about their properties. In short, we will employ a machine learning approach to design metaheuristics, explore how features can be used to make predictions, and how effectively we can design metaheuristics given a problem's features. 
 
There are three broad types of computational problems; easy (tractable), hard (intractable), and impossible (incomputable). These problems are challenging purely because of the astronomical number of possible solutions and trying every possibility would require an infeasible amount of time. Metaheuristics tackle the hard problems, mitigating this issue by sampling a tiny subset of the possibilities. One drawback is that there is no guarantee of performance. FAIME will examine the efficacy of automatically designing metaheuristics, along with key performance indicators of the metaheuristics, such as scalability, tolerance, robustness, convergence.

There are issues with current practices in metaheuristic research which we plan to tackle directly. These include the following:
-There are few principles to assist with the design of metaheuristics, making it a trial and error process. A feature based approach will provide a framework against which to address this. 
-There is an explosion in the number of published metaheuristics, in particular metaphorically inspired ones, with few guidelines to select among them. A feature based approach can provide a basis offering some guidance. 
-Metaheuristics are often designed in isolation from the problems they will be applied to. FAIME will use feedback from the example problems to inform the design process. 
Also, manually designing metaheuristics has its limitations. While it does produce better performing metaheuristics, it does not contribute to an understanding of how to produce better metaheuristics. FAIME drives deeper by automatically generating metaheuristics and then using features to provide a framework for classification, providing a basis to understand their design. 
 
This FAIME project will
-automatically designs metaheuristics for example problems using a factory consisting of two levels, a generating-level and a test-level which generates and tests metaheuristics. The metaheuristics will be generated by modifying their source code, and then tested on a set of problems. We will 
-investigate the properties of the metaheuristics (scalability, tolerance, robustness, convergence).
-employ a recent technique which takes existing source code and improves it.
-be implemented on parallel machines, which are ideally suited to the design process.
-draw on computability theory, probability theory, and other recent mathematical results to inform the design process and feature based approach.

We do not yet have an effective classification scheme for metaheuristics and problems. A classification scheme which reflects the relationships of entities being classified brings clarity and allows predictions to be made. Using the feature based classification scheme, we will investigate the accuracy of predictions we can make about metaheuristics and problems. We aim to be able to make statistical statements about the performance of metaheuristics such as, metaheuristic H will deliver a solution of quality X units, with tolerance +/- Y units, within Z time units, thus offering some indication of performance and which metaheuristic to choose for which problem.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>ECONOMY
FAIME will appeal to start-up companies and SMEs which rely on metaheuristics at the centre of their products or services. The results of FAIME can feed into their procedures or used directly to deliver high-quality low-cost metaheuristics, designed at the push of a button. FAIME will support the activities of fledgling initiatives that need to rapidly develop prototype metaheuristics to meet changing demands. Any activity which propels new ideas at a faster pace will contribute to wealth creation. This allows tighter gaps in the market to be populated more efficiently and reduces the time to market for any product or service relying on metaheuristics. Today's SMEs become tomorrow's large organizations and therefore any infrastructure that supports this transition will have merits. 

PEOPLE
We are supplying a tool which will assist metaheuristic designers. FAIME can be used to improve or test existing metaheuristics. FAIME will deliver a new methodology with which researchers can be more creative and productive. This places us in a position to be able to deliver higher quality metaheuristic to a wider audience. If a set of problems change, reflecting say changes in the market, FAIME can deliver a new metaheuristics in response, thus supporting people within the organization by providing the necessary infrastructure to rapidly design specific metaheuristics.

As an example, some mathematical software packages have built-in libraries of genetic algorithms. These packages are used widely by, for example engineers, who model a problem and then optimize it. The short term vision, within the scope of this project, is to develop a software library which is freely available. A longer term vision of FAIME, beyond its current scope, is to have this library integrated into third party software.

KNOWLEDGE
FAIME represents a step-change in the approach to designing metaheuristics, offering a new technique (a way to generate metaheuristics), and a method to understand the technique (a way to classify and make predictions about metaheuristics and problems). FAIME will provide a new platform on which research questions can be addressed offering inroads to a number of theoretical and practical issues such as scalability. FAIME offers an integrated framework for metaheuristics and problems, deepening our knowledge, laying the foundations for the next generation of metaheuristic researchers. 

The field of metaheuristics is largely driven by researchers comparing metaheuristics. While this process itself can be automated, FAIME goes further. We propose a feature based approach to describe and classify metaheuristics and problems allowing predictions to be made about them. Thus we are making a contribution to knowledge at a different level to the way progress is usually perceived in the field.

SOCIETY
Metaheuristics are used in a number of branches concerning health care, from nurse rostering and surgery scheduling to image recognition. As an example of how FAIME can be employed, beyond that of our current industrial partner, consider scheduling surgeries at different hospitals. Each hospital is individual having its own staff, number of operating theatres and patients. An off-the-shelf metaheuristic could be employed to schedule the surgeries, but FAIME offers the ability to build tailored scheduling metaheuristics specific to each hospital, each one having different resources. FAIME will be able to take into account differences between hospitals which a generic metaheuristic cannot. This will allow us to make better use of existing resources.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100064</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E6D740D0-AB87-43F7-A1DD-19B99A47BAD1</gtr:id><gtr:title>A hyper-heuristic approach to automated generation of mutation operators for evolutionary programming</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Applied Soft Computing</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/3961a22ebbf849e2d6973434221d7909"><gtr:id>3961a22ebbf849e2d6973434221d7909</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hong L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fecced27667.35778670</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/N002849/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
