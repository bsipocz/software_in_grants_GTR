Understanding and improving health from a comprehensive gender perspective.</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/M00256X/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Everyone has the right to a chance of a long life in good health, no matter whether they are a man or a woman, rich or poor. However, globally men (in both rich and poor countries) experience a higher burden of disease and have lower life expectancy than women. Much of this difference is due to men's risk-taking behaviours: they drink more alcohol, smoke more tobacco and drive more dangerously than women do. Some of this is driven by gender - i.e. the social rules and norms that tell each and every one of us what is appropriate behavior for men and women in all societies. 

Much of the current research on gender and health focuses mainly on women and girls and their health-related risks. We believe it is very important to understand and address the issues that globally place men more at risk of illness, disability and early death. This is important not only for the health of men, but also for women's health too - for example, there is increasing evidence that young women in many countries are now beginning to drink and smoke at similar rates to their male peers. There is also evidence that men's risk-taking impacts negatively on women's health and wellbeing.

We plan to establish and strengthen a network of researchers, practitioners and health advocates, who are engaged with studying and acting to improve the health of both men and women around the world through a better understanding of gender and health issues. Over a period of 3 years, researchers and campaigners in Asia, Africa, the Middle East, the Americas and Europe will come together to deliberate and identify solutions to improve the health of populations in different parts of the world. These ideas will be shared and debated with both policy makers and the communities of men and women whose health outcomes we are hoping to improve. 

Seminars will be open to a wide variety of participants, and at least half the time the seminars will be web-based and hence available to all. We will communicate the outputs from the seminars through websites and social media, and hope that in doing so we can raise awareness that gender affects the behaviours, risks, and health of everyone, not just women and girls.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This proposed activities will benefit a wide range of stakeholders - both as immediate and potential future beneficiaries. Immediate beneficiaries will include collaborators in the proposed new network of researchers, and advocates with an interest in gender, health and masculinities. In addition, participants in the seminars held in each country will benefit from the opportunity to discuss and share ideas about gender and health and identify common problems and solutions.

Additional beneficiaries from each seminar will include those who access the seminar series through the web. Seminars will either be held as webinars, in which case seminar participation is available to all web-users. In addition, we will upload seminar highlights (e.g. presentations, podcasts and vod-casts) post-hoc - again making the seminars available to all web-users. The webinars and all web-based activity will be administered through UCL. 

Potential future beneficiaries of this seminar series will include those in decision-making positions who are concerned with priority-setting and resource allocation in health programmes nationally, regionally and globally. Seminar outputs will include policy briefs and research summaries, and these will be disseminated locally to key decision-makers identified through the networks of our proposed collaborators. It is hoped that these outputs will increase the capacity of health decision-makers to make evidence-informed decisions about how best to address issues of gender, health and masculinities. Where evidence is lacking, the network will use its linkages and communication skills to advocate for increased research funding and evidence-gathering. 

The proposed new network and seminars will benefit other emerging processes in global health research and policy. For example, through our close links to multilateral institutions (such as WHO and UNFPA) we expect the seminars and their outputs to be of great benefit as they develop their future gender and health strategies. 

This proposal has been developed with a range of inputs from both academic and civil society partners, and engagement with civil society will be crucial to ensuring that evidence-informed decisions around gender, health and masculinities are in place in the future. We expect the seminars will be of great interest to a wide variety of civil society organisations working in the fields of health, gender and development. The proposed outputs from the seminars will be useful as advocacy tools. In addition, we expect that future research proposals will be developed as collaborative activities between academic partners and civil society partners. These proposals will specifically include more junior members of staff from collaborating institutions in order to build future capacity in this area. 

We will measure the impact of the seminar series through a variety of monitoring indicators, including, but not limited to: 
1. Number of collaborative institutions and individuals who participate in the new network focused on gender and health
2. Rates of participation in seminars - both physical attendance, and participation in webinars
3. Sign-up rates to receive email invitations to web and other events hosted by the network
4. Number of times that web-based videos and presentations are viewed and downloaded after events
5. Number of collaborative research proposals submitted by network members
6. Participation of junior colleagues in the development of research proposals.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>29525</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Stanford University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with Stanford University</gtr:description><gtr:id>C403F9B3-6281-4B3B-BFA2-2661E33A3E05</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Outputs from this multidisciplinary collaboration (public health specialists, medical specialists, health economists, international relations experts, mathematical modellers, social historians) will be 5 Lancet papers in 2017/8.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58752fca90c732.99926904-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Stanford University will be leading on the coordination of 5 papers in a series on Gender and Global Health.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The Lancet has commissioned Stanford University to produce a series of 5 papers on gender and health.

Seminar participants were drawn from across the globe and through extensive use of social media we reached a wide audience.
Gender, specifically gender inequality, plays a major role in vulnerability to disasters and their impacts (in the short and long-term). Societal constructs, which marginalise certain groups, establish these vulnerabilities that both create and exacerbate disasters. When looking at disasters through the 'gender lens' it is vital to remember that the subject of gender in crises is not limited only to women (although gender inequality significantly disadvantages women, in general and throughout the disaster cycle, therefore the launch largely focussed upon women), nor can gender be restricted to two binary categories of 'male' or 'female', instead numerous gender identities exist. Similarly, we must understand the complex intersections between gender oppression and other forms of oppression, such as racism or ableism, and how these contribute to unique experiences of discrimination that create exposure or vulnerability to disaster.

The seminar participants recognised that post-disaster efforts must be cross-sectoral and collaborative. Academics and practitioners need to work in partnership to fill data gaps, particularly in collecting further disaggregated data, and then use findings to shape the way that we work. Likewise, government and private sector involvement are crucial to engaging a wider audience and beginning to influence social constructs, policy and legislation. In isolation, the ability of each sector to make positive change is limited.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bd6ab7e770d4.90617613</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.rescueglobal.org/news/view/launch-of-the-university-college-london-centre-for-gender-and-health</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seminar on men and antiretroviral therapies/HIV, Cape Town, South Africa</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6D004000-B90C-4BE3-9DFE-77A7FBAFAD51</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This seminar was a simultaneous webinar and physical panel discussion, held as part of the 'Association for the Social Sciences and Humanities in HIV' (ASSHH) conference, at the Stellenbosch Institute for Advanced Study (STIAS) conference centre in Stellenbosch, South Africa.

The seminar had both short-term and longer-term impacts. In the short term, the outcomes included: increased networking between international academic research organisations; promoting the voices of civil society as participants in the seminar; and engagement with decision-makers. The overall impact on beneficiaries: positive feedback has been received from participants, who expressed that they found the panel/webinar useful, informative and thought provoking.
In the longer term we are pursuing collaborative research proposals and joint publishing opportunities across the UK and South African groups involved, as well as planning for increased engagement with decision-makers.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dc23a245e929.44241850</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seminar on gender-based violence, UCL</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BA8496AA-3482-417D-8BD0-6851453FF438</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We organised a panel on gender-based violence (GBV) and invited speakers from across the UK as well as South Africa to share experiences, ideas and research plans for the &amp;quot;next generation&amp;quot; of research on GBV.

The event was attended by approx 100 people in the room itself, and many more people who joined us through social and webstreaming media. 
The event garnered a lively and wide-ranging discussion, particularly on the question of whether and how to capture emotional and psychological GBV in surveys.

The seminar brought together researchers, activists, advocates, policy makers, practitioners from around the world and provided an opportunity for interdisciplinary reflections on understanding the relationship between masculinity and health. Panellists focused on challenging the concept of hegemonic masculinity and how it relates to both men's and women's wellbeing.

Plans for future collaborative activities include establishing a network of researchers interested in masculinities and health, and hosting a further seminar series on this topic.

Leaders from the worlds of both the UN and NGOs recognized that challenging the gender status quo requires vision, leadership and accountability. Jan Beagle (UNAIDS), Maryse Simonet (EU) and Geeta Misra (CREA) all called for partnership across institutions and movements. These views were reflected in the contributions from academics on the seminar panel too. The panels recognized the need to embrace the non-linear and complex nature of human relationships, power, and the construction of gender and health, and proposed an intersectional approach to understanding gender and health. Such an approach may help synthesize this complexity across policy, research, and programs. 

The complexity of the relationship between gender and global health institutions was addressed from the perspectives both of outward-facing activities as well as the action for gender equity/equality within institutions themselves. 

In the tradition of feminism and other social advocacy movements, panelists embraced the notion of being 'a thorn in the side' of their institutions, organizations and communities in order to continually challenge gender norms and go beyond the status quo.

2017: The results of the seminars held in London (in February 2017) have been extremely positive and have led to the establishment of a global network of partners who work on issues of gender and health. This network (hosted by the new Centre for Gender and Global Health) at UCL includes researchers, practitioners, policy makers, advocates and activists. Future activities include: joint publications; joint seminar series; and applying together for further funding to run the network.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2017</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>582A3E8A-0722-495E-BBA4-9D00AA0DDC4B</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56dc1ed4d25db0.10296366</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Our seminars (held in India, USA, South Africa) have been instrumental in opening a debate about men's involvement in health services previously mainly focused on women.

We have established a nascent network of all who came to our seminars, and plan to apply for further funding opportunities to take this work and these ideas forward.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C783FCE3-5C46-47B8-98BF-3B8FE889FA1D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dc20714870b7.83363389</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Development of tools for European Union to incorporate a gender lens in their health portfolio</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DB78D3A1-76B1-4C75-A33F-D4744AE027B0</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58ae25daf03573.13737755</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly4lXY4Gai4&amp;feature=youtu.be</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Request to present evidence on the relationship between gender and health to All Party Parliamentary Group on Malaria and NTDs</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FA6A1421-F379-43B2-876F-47D98AC8B574</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58bd68fd4a56b0.56532021</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/M00256X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F6A8697C-69DA-4020-8D45-9901CA002827</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Global Health and Medicine</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
