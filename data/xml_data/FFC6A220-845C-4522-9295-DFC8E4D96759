Using a novel divided exhaust flow arrangement, the blow-down flow and the associated energy usually lost as part of the exhaust flow is recovered by a turbine. During the main displacement flow the turbine is by-passed and the crankshaft does not have to do any work exhausting the burnt gases through the turbine. The result is the recovery of the blowdown energy without negatively impacting the engine crankshaft torque. This energy is then innovatively used to depressurise the exhaust system which generates extra crankshaft torque during the exhaust stroke giving a primary torque increase and CO2 emission reduction.Secondary benefits include increased energy availability from the blowdown pulse and potentially improved low speed torque (through increased pressure drop across the turbine). There will be less hot exhaust gas residuals within the cylinder which will extend the knock limit of turbocharged spark ignition engines allowing further downsizing than is currently possible.Importantly, the effect on the combustion system is negligible allowing the Turbo-Discharging approach to be used with all current and future IC engines without significant redesign. The impact on CO2 emissions could therefore be much larger than costly technologies offering larger CO2 reductions in only small niche markets.Turbo-Discharging requires the addition of a turbine and compressor (as used in a conventional turbocharging system) and does not require complexities such as wastegating or variable geometry turbines. The cost is therefore small, placing the technology in a very competitive position compared with many other CO2 reducing technologies. With engine manufacturers requiring combined technologies to meet future CO2 emission targets, this technology will be very attractive to industry. Initial contact with industrial has shown that experimental demonstration of this technology is needed before they will invest. This project will experimentally study, develop and demonstrate Turbo-Discharging as a feasible, cost effective and novel approach to reducing IC engine CO2 emissions, ultimately leading to industrial collaboration and implementation of Turbo-Discharging on-vehicle.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Turbo-Discharging has the potential for significant real world fuel economy and CO2 reductions in applications such as passenger cars, commercial transport vehicles, off-road vehicles and machines e.g. power generation. New technologies to reduce fuel consumption that are cost effective and allow product differentiation will have a very significant impact in these markets. Turbo-Discharging has the potential to increase engine torque as well as improve fuel economy under most engine conditions, which is very unusual for new engine technologies. It is also predicted to be a very cost-effective solution applicable to all IC engines. The benefit of such a technology that improves fuel consumption on a large proportion of the vehicle fleet is much greater than one offering larger fuel economy benefits only in small niche markets. In the current economic climate where multiple technologies are needed to meet CO2 targets this will be very attractive to industry. Additional benefits from this technology include lower emissions (e.g. particulate matter, NOx, CO and HC, which scale with fuel consumption) that may reduce demand on and associated cost of emission after-treatment systems. Future engine developments such as exhaust thermal energy recovery are directly synergous with this technology meaning that the cost-benefit will improve. This research will open a new product area for the automotive industry enabling new businesses to start. Such a fundamentally new way of applying turbocharger technology requires a shift in how to design, develop and apply the technology to engines. This will result in new skills and business opportunities. Aftermarket business will grow as the technology is suitable as an add-on to existing IC engines offering fuel economy, emissions and performance improvements. Individual businesses (in e.g. construction or transport logistics) will benefit from reduced operating costs and potentially tax benefits. Torque and power improvements will also improve market position for automotive manufacturers and heavy duty engine manufacturers. This directly contributes to the UK's efforts to reduce CO2 emissions from IC engines. The economic impact is, therefore, potentially very large. Since this technology is using existing hardware in a fundamentally new and innovative way, it can be rapidly developed. It is anticipated that a successful demonstration of this technology will be achieved within this project and will lead to a collaborative project with industry. This work is ideally suited to lead onto a future TSB supported project. In addition to the technological impact, this project will give applied turbo-machinery experience to the Research Associate and PhD student. This will support high quality training within the University and output highly trained researchers with experience ideally suited to the advanced automotive industry where downsizing of engines is becoming prevalent. This will lead to long term economic reward from this research. To realise these benefits it is important to prove the feasibility of the technology to industry and gain strong support from key industrial organisations. A thorough communications and engagement plan (see the Impact Plan) has been documented to maximise the exposure of this work and generate further industrial support. The PI has significant experience working directly with the IC engine industry with such notable companies as Jaguar, Caterpillar (inc. Perkins) and Lotus and his work has contributed to their current and future products. His time as a chairman of UnICEG (which is strongly attended by industry) makes him well known outside of his direct fields of research and has resulted in many contacts already in place to begin the engagement of industry.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-01-04</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-07-05</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>121031</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Patent status:

Commercial strategy

In March 2013 , Loughborough University entered into an agreement with AltEnergis, a London-based technology company focusing on the development of early-stage technologies. AltEnergis is working in partnership with Loughborough University to select the right commercial partners to help successfully bring Turbo-Discharging to market.

We are now seeking partners in IC engine power generation to demonstrate the benefits of Turbo-Discharging technology in their products.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2007</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>AB8D6AE1-E193-4D85-8B91-2F397C7421B8</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5463cbad5fbdd8.19099991</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Energy,Environment,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput><gtr:description>Delivering an effective engine air system is critical to the success of powertrain products. 

Using a novel divided exhaust flow arrangement, the blow-down flow from the engine cylinders and the associated energy usually lost as part of the exhaust gas flow is recovered by a turbine. During the main displacement flow from the engine the turbine is by-passed and the crankshaft does not have to do any work exhausting the burnt gases through the turbine. The result is the recovery of the blowdown energy without negatively impacting the engine crankshaft torque. This energy is then used to depressurise the exhaust system which generates extra crankshaft torque during the exhaust stroke giving a primary torque increase and CO2 emission reduction.

Secondary benefits (not included in the above fuel economy estimates) include increased energy availability from the blowdown pulse and potentially improved low speed torque (through increased pressure drop across the turbine). There will be less hot exhaust gas residuals within the cylinder which will extend the knock limit of turbocharged spark ignition engines allowing further downsizing or increased compression ratio.

Importantly, the effect on the combustion system is small allowing the Turbo-Discharging approach to be used with all current and future IC engines without significant redesign. The technology requires the addition of:
1.A turbocharger like turbo-machine (no VGT, possibly a wastegate - but not essential)
2.A heat exchanger comparable to an EGR heat exchanger
3.A more complex exhaust manifold with one connection to each exhaust port

The addition of a heat exchanger is not necessary when applying to a powertrain that includes exhaust thermal energy recover.

The technology is additive and can work directly with turbocharging systems. The addition of turbo-discharging increases the energy that can be extracted from the exhaust gases allowing fuel economy improvements and potential improvements in engine transient response

Turbo-discharging is a key new technology available to the IC engine power generation industry that can offer performance and fuel economy improvements for gas, petrol and diesel fuelled engines.

Turbo-Discharging is an additive technology in that the benefits it offers are mostly independent of existing and future fuel efficiency technologies. It can offer benefits to future engines including turbocharged (TC) and naturally aspirated (NA) gasoline engines, diesel engines, gas engines, rotary engines, of any fuel type, hybrids and those with exhaust heat recovery systems.

The amount of benefit from turbo-discharging is a function of the exhaust gas temperatures, load control (e.g. fuelling or throttling) and engine characteristics. The table below indicates the relative fuel economy, torque and transient response benefits for different common engines. Engine test data has demonstrated up to 6% fuel economy benefit and more than 7% torque increase across a significant region of the operating range of NA gasoline engines. Simulation on turbocharged engines indicates significant low speed torque benefits, potential improvements in transient response in addition to the fuel economy benefit.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Several engine and car manufacturers are evaluating the new technique for future products.
