However the methods to understand these and to extract meaningful, biologically relevant readouts from these data sets is underdeveloped. We are developing computational and statistical tools, methods and resources to integrate, mine, model and visualize these complex data-sets and convert them into a format that can advance our knowledge of cancer biology. This will enable a better comprehension of the circuitry involved in tumour formation, disease progression and metastasis, and can be applied to the development of targeted therapeutics.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Numerous genetic aberrations affecting a large number of gene products contribute to tumour development and the accepted hallmarks of cancer, often making therapies based on single targets ineffective. These aberrations and their consequences are propagated via transcriptional, translational and post-translational networks. The resultant information circuits can extend across cell and tissue types and also modulate the microenvironment. How to integrate and model this percolation of information and properties across different biological scales, in both time and space is accepted as a major challenge to fully understanding the aetiology, progression and dynamics of tumorigenesis. Novel computational methods, tools and resources are essential to address this challenge. 
Transcriptomic and copy number assessment studies suggest that specific sets of key pathways that regulate cellular phenotypes are pathologically altered in cancer. However, pathway centric approaches are not completely effective because pathways don?t operate in isolation; instead, multiple interacting pathways form a complex web of networks. Methods to decipher cellular information flows (whether they are signalling, metabolic or regulatory) can shed light on the underlying cellular complexity and identify systems level properties. The objective of this research programme is therefore to develop a network perspective of tumorigenesis using a mixture of both integrative data driven as well as computational modelling approaches.
The programme harnesses data science approaches coupled with computational and systems biology methodologies to develop novel methods, tools and resources for systems level biomedical data-integration. It addresses these objectives by 1) modelling multi-scale cellular regulomes involved in tumorigenesis, 2) developing these model into knowledge discovery systems to assist in understanding of cancer datasets, and 3) Using these resources to elucidate phenotypic impact and identify therapeutic intervention points of these regulomes for further experimental evaluation.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>249000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Photography exhibition at the Cambridge Science Festival 2015</gtr:description><gtr:id>F5A7614C-C5EB-46BD-934A-C935B8AC8E87</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Interactions with the general public</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58a1cdd2b6a8c2.78280231</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>&quot;Through the eyes of scientists&quot;</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.sciencefestival.cam.ac.uk/system/files/csf_2015_web_programme.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Working life blog for MRC Insight</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E9C5DEFE-0C47-4AE1-933F-3CA6191C1F4E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Contributed to a blog article which featured in MRC Insight.

It is a free event, over two weeks, with an excess of 270 events and more than 30000 attendees. As part of this, the MRC CU along with the CRUK CI organised a set of talks and activities that were attended by over 100 people from all walks of life - from young children and young adults to parents/carers and professionals. The Samarajiwa lab was part of the MRC CU team at this event . The event generated a lot of interest in cancer research, helped raise awareness about the importance of 'early' in cancer which is the mission of the MRC CU and also led to a lot of interest being generated in the MRC Festival of Science which followed on later in the year.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58a1dafc7b0065.53746078</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.sciencefestival.cam.ac.uk/events?search_api_views_fulltext=cancer</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015,2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Public talk at the Cambridge science festival.</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AA43CE47-D353-418C-8377-7A987C177C9B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>talk title: Battling cancer with data science</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>589331bb4bfec2.38342630</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.cambridgecancercentre.org.uk/news/cancer-talks-cambridge-science-festival</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Participation in MRC Festival of Science Open Day at MRC CU</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EFF01B16-6BC0-44C1-8985-734A6B7CEF76</gtr:id><gtr:impact>60 sixth-form students from across 8 schools in Cambridge visited the MRC Cancer Unit on the afternoon of the 22nd of June, 2016 for an Open Day. All students, accompanied by their teachers, were given a tour of the enitre building with an opportunity for engaging with researchers about the state of the art in cancer research and gaining hands-on experience with setting up experiments. Talks about career opportunities and challenges associated with pursuing cancer research were also available to all attendees. The event sparked a great deal of interest and enthusiasm in students and teachers alike and we have had a request for this event to be continued. We will be pursuing a similar format of activities for the MRC Science Festival in 2017, but reach out to more number of schools, including those outside of Cambridge city perimeters.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58a1da3907e077.54605527</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://mrccancerunit.wordpress.com/2016/07/06/inspiring-the-next-generation-of-cancer-researchers-the-mrc-cancer-unit-open-day-2016/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Organised and implemented computational biology and genome technologies training courses for biomedical researchers</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>748859FC-002D-41A7-84E2-B9D1C34B713F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Improved complex and large data-set analysis of both local, national and international biomedical researchers.
