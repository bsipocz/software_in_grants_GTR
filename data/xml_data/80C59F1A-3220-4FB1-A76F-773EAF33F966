Physical and occupational therapies have been shown to benefit people but residual disability for a large proportion of patients still remains a key issue in regaining full independence. There is promising research evidence emerging from pilot studies which indicate that combining certain drugs with physical and occupational therapy may improve the recovery of arm and leg movements essential day to day activities such as walking and getting dressed. These improvements are in addition to the benefits gained from physiotherapy and occupational therapy alone. These studies suggest that the nerve circuits in the brain responds better to the usual therapy when they are also exposed to drugs such as dopamine at the same time as having occupational or physiotherapy. A lot of this evidence comes from small studies. We feel that it is important to study this effect properly in larger scale studies as some of the scientific issues cannot easily be addressed in small studies. If this approach is beneficial it will revolutionise rehabilitation treatment for people with stroke worldwide. It will have a major inpact of recovery and independence after stroke for a significant number of people. In this present study we will find out if combining L-dopa (a widely available and inexpensive drug that is widely used to treat Parkinson's Disease) with routine occupational and physical therapy enhances the effect of the therapy and further improves recovery of functionally useful arm and leg movement in people with first ever stroke. A total of 572 people with stroke will be randomly allocated to receive either active drug (L-dopa+carbidopa) or a placebo tablet about one hour before their physiotherapy or occupational therapy treatment session. All study participants will receive the usual stroke care within their hospital rehabilitation setting. Those suitable to take part in this study will be identified at two weeks after admission to hospital with stroke. We will provide detailed information about the study and seek their consent to participate. Those providing consent will be randomly allocated to one of two groups. Group 1 will receive the active drug approximately 60 minutes before their routine physical and occupational therapy sessions (up to two sessions per day) for up to 6 weeks. Group 2 will receive a placebo drug in combination with routine physical and occupational therapy. The medication will be continued at home if the person is still having rehabilitation treatment after discharge from hospital. People with stroke who are recruited to this study will be assessed on pre determined outcome measures such as their ability to walk and use their arms for functional activities at baseline (2 weeks), 8 weeks, 6 months and 12 months after stroke by an independent researcher. A comprehensive team of stroke and clinical trial experts will conduct the study in partnership with stroke survivors and their carers. The study will be adopted by the UK SRN, who provide support to user involvement.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Scientific Abstract Design: A multicentre prospective randomised double blinded placebo controlled trial. 572 people with new stroke admitted to acute stroke services will be recruited. Setting: At least 8 UK stroke services within Stroke Local Research Networks(LRN) that have an acute inpatient rehabilitation facility and a service that allows rehabilitation treatments to be continued within the home setting. Target population: People with new stroke aged &amp;gt;=18 years, Rivermead Mobility Index(RMI) score &amp;lt;7 at time of recruitment(7-14 days post stroke). Exclusion criteria: Unlikely to survive more than 1 month, those requiring palliative care as advised by treating physician; Parkinsons disease; contraindications to L-dopa; unable to walk prior to stroke due to pre-existing co-morbidities(e.g. osteoarthritis). LRN staff will identify participants and consent. Intervention: L-dopa 100mg + carbidopa 25mg(as co-careldopa) will be given to patients as a single oral tablet 45-60 minutes before physical therapy or occupational therapy sessions (section 7.3) focused on motor skills(e.g. walking, dressing). Participants will be randomised equally between study drug and placebo within 7-14 days after stroke(stratification see section 5.1). Individual participant randomisation will be undertaken by the CTRU. The placebo will be given as an oral tablet 45-60 minutes before rehabilitation treatment. Production of trial medication blister packs will be formulated so placebo has the same appearance and packaging as active drug (Bilcare Ltd). Routine physical and occupational therapy will be administered to all patients in both groups. Treatments recorded using a standardized recording sheet. Phamacoadherence issues, see section 7. Outcomes: Primary outcome: The proportion of participants walking as defined by a score of 7 or above on the Rivermead Mobility Index, in the L-dopa and control intervention groups. This is a robust unambiguous clinical cut off indicator of L-dopa effect as it defines clearly the proportion of those walking at least 10 metres without assistance from another person, in the active and control groups at the primary end point (8 weeks) and the secondary end points (6,12 months). The RMI has been validated and extensively used in clinical studies. Secondary outcomes: (a) Barthel Index, self care dependency in stroke; (b)Motor Activity Log-28(AOU), functional upper limb activities; (c) Northwick Park Nursing Dependency measure, physical dependency from which care costs can be estimated; (d) Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living Scale, measures activities such as outdoor mobility and household tasks; (e) General Health Questionnaire 28, measures depression; (f) Caregiver Burden Index, measures carer strain; (g) EQ-5D, measure of health status for economic evaluation; (h) a proforma will be developed to record study drug adherence as part of rehabilitation treatment, type of rehabilitation treatment given, (i) Modified Rankin Scale to relate this study data to other clinical trials (see National Stroke Trials database), (j) RMI change score to capture changes in posture and movement, (k) Baseline routinely collected clinical data will be used to allow Edinburgh case mix adjuster to be completed and ensure that the the baseline clinical characteristics are comparable across the active and control groups. Data on concomitant medication will be recorded. We will also collect data on lesion location identified from routinely undertaken Brain CT scans at time of admission to stroke unit. We anticipate that this data would be available for the majority of patients recruited to the study. We will trial the use of a standardized proforma to collect the data on lesion location as part of the baseline assessment using the method described by Barber et al 2000. Follow up: Baseline assessments (prior to randomisation), 8 weeks (primary) after randomisation; 6 and 12 months after randomisation. 8 weeks was chosen as the</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-07-19</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-01-20</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1564436</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Patient focus group</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:id>F3715FF5-7585-4105-87A9-23F9674CF8F9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The aim of the patient focus group was to elicit information from people with stroke about the design of the IMP (to enable adhearance to the intervention) and also provide feedback on the information provided about the clinical trial
