They perform many vital roles in nature acting as hormones, toxins, flavours, smells and pigments. These compounds are also the basis of numerous medically important drugs used to treat cancer, lower cholesterol, suppress the immune system and fight infection. Sales of polyketide based medicines total over &amp;pound;30 billion each year and there is enormous worldwide interest in identifying new polyketides and making new and improved versions of existing ones. Polyketides are made within microorganisms by clusters of proteins called polyketide synthases, usually shortened to PKSs. PKSs function like miniature factory assembly lines within cells. Each different protein within the assembly line is responsible for building or modifying a specific part of the carbon skeleton of the polyketide product. There are considerable differences in the structures and activities of different polyketides made by different PKSs from different microorganisms. This is despite the fact that all of these compounds are produced from the same initial chemical building blocks. Understanding how these differences are achieved relies on an in-depth knowledge of how PKSs work, essentially, what do each of the proteins in the assembly line do, how do they do it and how are they arranged relative to each other? This research project will focus on a new family of PKSs which generate highly unusual products used to treat a range of different diseases. By examining the structures of the components of the PKS in fine detail using a technique called X-ray crystallography, we will try to work out how each of different parts of the PKS works and how they fit together and interact with each other. These experiments will not only allow us to decipher how these systems make their important products, but will also provide us with a blue-print that we can use to construct new PKSs which make new medicines.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Modular polyketide synthases, non-ribosomal peptides synthases or hybrids thereof are giant (upto 5 MDa) multi-functional enzymes that assemble complex natural product scaffolds in a highly programmed linear fashion. Within the synthase complex, individual enzymatic domains are organised into associated extension modules, with each module responsible for the elongation of the product chain by a single functional unit. Extension modules are often elaborated to house multiple catalytic domains which act in concert with the minimal chain extension machinery to further modify the growing product chain. Recent work focused on the characterisation of modular systems from 'exotic' bacterial taxa has resulted in the identification of a new group of multi-modular synthases that do not adhere to the established colinearity rules of the polyketide biosynthetic pathway. These novel systems, termed trans-AT synthases, have evolved independently from other modular systems and comprise disparate enzymatic activities from apparently unrelated metabolic pathways, which have converged to yield a single functional synthase. The aim of this project is to provide a molecular description of this novel enzymatic machine. To achieve this goal we will deconstruct the individual components of the model trans-AT system bacillaene synthase and by marrying X-ray crystallography with in vitro kinetic, thermodynamic and spectroscopic methods, and organic synthesis, provide a detailed description of the trans-AT biosynthetic framework at the domain, module and multi-module level.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Around two thirds of all drugs in current clinical use are derived from or based upon molecules isolated from natural sources. This accounts for a multi-billion pound global market comprising antibiotics, antifungals, antiparasitics, anticancer agents and the cholesterol lowering statins. In 2009 four of the top twenty best selling pharmacological agents world-wide were molecules based on natural product scaffolds, with the statin derived cholesterol lowering agent Lipitor ranked number one. As the feasibility of high-throughput screening methodologies for target based drug development is increasingly being brought into question, there in now renewed interest in the identification and isolation of new natural product based medicines. This renewed interest has resulted in the re-establishment of many natural product drug discovery pipelines in the pharmaceutical industry and companies dedicated to the development of new therapeutic agents from natural sources are in operation in the UK, France, Spain, Germany, Switzerland, USA, China and Japan. Among new natural product targets the polyketides, non-ribosomal peptides and hybrids thereof remain one of if not the most attractive molecules for clinical development, with many polyketide and non-ribosomal peptide derived compounds in the latter stages of clinical trials. The enormous potential to modify and manipulate the polyketide and non-ribosomal peptide biosynthetic pathway offers a route to both the rational generation of tailor-made product analogues and the high-throughput generation of large compound libraries without the cost, complexity and environmental impact of synthetic chemical approaches. For this goal to be realised however, a detailed understanding of the synthetic process is essential. The work outlined within this application will provide this information, bridging the gap that currently exists between gene sequence and product chemistry. Our studies will not only offer insight into one of nature's most complex biosynthetic assemblies impacting significantly on both the academic and industrial biosciences community, but also provide a structural framework for the manipulation of synthase systems for the production of 'next-generation' natural product derived therapeutic agents. Such output will inevitably impact on the healthcare and well-being of the populous and the economic competitiveness of the UK. This program will offer those involved (PDRAs, students, etc.) experience and training at the chemistry-biology interface, providing them with the skills to succeed in a future career in academia or industry. The research output from this program will be reported to the wider scientific community through publication in leading peer reviewed journals, presentation at national and international conferences and at meetings with industrial and academic collaborators. Appropriate training will be given to the PDRAs in the preparation of papers, posters and oral presentations to ensure that, alongside their scientific knowledge and skills, they are developing a portfolio of widely transferable skills. Further, significant opportunities exist for the presentation of research findings (by the PI and PDRA) to a more general audience through public engagement activities organised by the PIs department (school talks, Bristol sciences festival, etc.) and through the PIs links with the Royal Society eg. the Summer 2010 Science Festival. Such activities will ensure that as broad an audience as is feasible will be informed of our ongoing research.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-18</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-09-19</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>335596</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>BioServ UK</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Peptide Nano-factory project</gtr:description><gtr:id>BCDC3A11-2304-4019-BEBF-1EB3B828DABB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Further funding has been awarded from the UK Synthetic Biology IKC (SynbiCITE) and Innovate UK/BBSRC via the IB catalyst, to refine and commercialize the technology (see further funding).

The purpose of the capital money is to create a 'national capability' in DNA synthesis which will support the long term growth of UK synthetic biology.
Attendees were required to complete a questionnaire in advance of the workshop identifying the (up to) five biggest research challenges for the next generation of DNA synthesis and the barriers to a coordinated state-of -the-art national capability. At the workshop attendees further considered what capability is already available and therefore what the existing requirements and bottlenecks for a UK capability are. 
The key outcome of the activity was the generation of a small number of short strategic cases for capital investment. These are currently being reviewed by BBSRC. 
Representatives from the private sector were also present at the workshop and it is anticipated that they will work closely with the academic community in the development of technologies that tackle challenges that underpin the next generation of DNA synthesis, but also in bringing the technologies/ capabilities developed closer to market/ into wider use.

Long term there will be tangible impacts generated from the instruments purchased via this award if successful. The impact is likely to be mainly in the academic and industrial spheres, and in the areas of fine and speciality chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and life science technologies.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5461d476edb2e4.53441845</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academic audiences (collaborators, peers etc.)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>ERASynBio workshop of the European Synthetic Biology Centres</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>50FCF2E0-4301-4950-8BBF-471E55D416FA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The key results of this activity were to inspire and feed further ERASynBio developments and recommendations to the European Commission.

This has been through the adoption of the principles of PKS enzymology established during the course of the study and exploiting this information to inform the research of others. Such discoveries have also impacted upon the industrial natural products community in a manner equivalent to that described above. Although there has not been a direct commercial impact from this grant, work performed during this study did establish preliminary data that has subsequently formed the basis of an industrial collaboration that has attracted further funding from 2 separate sources (&amp;pound;300k) and is seeking to develop a platform technology for the manufacture of high value biologics (see other sections). The outcomes from this grant have also been included in a number of outreach activities (Schools talks, science festivals) that have provided educational and societal impact through knowledge sharing with a range of publics.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>38F11ED5-5F0F-426C-AADC-178EF55A6A0D</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5460d235b4c270.87067569</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Education,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Polyketides are a structurally and functionally diverse family of bioactive natural products that are the basis of, or inspiration for, many of our most important pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. This project focuses on the multi-component biosynthetic mega-enzymes, termed polyketide synthases (PKSs), which are responsible for the assembly of polyketides in microorganisms. We have been specifically examining the so-called trans-AT PKSs, which exhibit unusual and potentially exploitable enzymology. The purpose of this research is to establish general rules and mechanisms regarding trans-AT PKS biosynthesis that may be exploited to direct the production of non-natural polyketides with improved bioactivities. 
During this project structural and functional characterization of the prototypical trans-AT PKS bacillaene synthase has been performed. This research has (i) established the molecular basis of beta-methyl branch formation in this system and explored the substrate tolerances of the enzymes responsible; (ii) provided a detailed molecular description of the trans-acting loading and reductive domains from this system and primed further studies to generate engineered loading domains with variant substrate selectivities; (iii) explored the enzymology of the trans-acting proof-reading enzyme PksD and demonstrated its ability to proof-read non-cognate acyl-carrier proteins in vitro and in vivo; (iv) allowed us to produce a range of multi-modular constructs from the bacillaene system for detailed in vitro characterization. We have been able to expand the scope of the project through collaboration with groups in Bristol and Birmingham, and explored equivalent biosynthetic steps in the mupirocin and kalamanticin trans-AT PKSs. We have demonstrated that although some trans-AT PKS enzymology is context dependent, it is possible to establish general rules that can be used predictively to determine trans-AT PKS function from amino acid sequence. It has also allowed us to identify new pressing research questions that relate to trans-AT PKS architecture and function. For example, can methyl-branch forming enzymes be freely exchanged between different trans-AT PKS? What are the determinants of ACP selectivity by trans-acting acyltransferases? How are three different successive branch insertions (an exomethylene, a secondary methyl, and an olefinic methyl) introduced in trans-AT systems with only a single complement of branching enzymes?
The research has proved instrumental in allowing us to establish a range of new collaborations in trans-AT PKS enzymology, specifically with groups in the UK (Birmingham, Cardiff, Newcastle, London) and internationally (Germany, France, Belgium, Indonesia, and USA). It has also allowed the research team to engage with associated consortia and networks, e.g. NPRONET, SynbiCITE, ERASynBio, etc. and to form a number of collaborative links with industrial partners (BioservUK, Centeo, Douglas Instruments). These links have resulted in research publications, presentations at conferences, and the acquisition of additional grant funding.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Many of the discoveries made during this project are fundamental in nature and will have significant impact on the academic community through the generation of new knowledge. This new knowledge has been, and will continue to be, disseminated through peer-reviewed publication in leading international journals, conference presentations, and involvement in networking activities and collaborative projects. We will also disseminate these discoveries more widely through outreach activities engaging the public fully, e.g. Science Cafes, school outreach programs, schools week, local Science Centres (e.g. @Bristol), Bright Nights Festival, Festival of Nature, etc. Some of the outcomes of this research may be commercially exploitable, for example our work on trans-AT acyltransferase selectivity and beta-methyl branch formation. We have prior experience of establishing collaborative links with industrial sponsors, and plan to forge similar links to realize the commercial impacts of our research. This has been, and will continue to be, achieved through involvement in a range of industrial facing initiatives and networks e.g. NPRONET, BIOCATNET, SynbiCITE, BrisSynBio, etc, exploiting our existing industrial links to highlight the value and impact of our research outcomes, and working with the University of Bristol's Research Enterprise and Development Unit to identify and approach potential industrial sponsors/collaborators.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B131F96E-CDBF-469B-BC06-D06E1D093636</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5460ca6e5b5db6.91932783</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Education,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://royalsociety.org/grants/case-studies/paul-race/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A8CFE83D-C989-40B6-B9AB-896310B9DFDA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Structural and Functional Analysis of Cell Wall-anchored Polypeptide Adhesin BspA in Streptococcus agalactiae.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Journal of biological chemistry</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2e1e70098dc3077db75d7b8283b67033"><gtr:id>2e1e70098dc3077db75d7b8283b67033</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rego S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0021-9258</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58be80c975d9b1.10994723</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3B6A5CAE-F133-43BA-B6C1-C4565018CFE6</gtr:id><gtr:title>Improving the success rate of protein crystallization by random microseed matrix screening.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/95e3bd0e56dcdb4a5dfb1e7f55dfbe52"><gtr:id>95e3bd0e56dcdb4a5dfb1e7f55dfbe52</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Till M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1940-087X</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>546093631e20b1.73094029</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6793AC9C-CAF5-4217-8310-389C17CA06F0</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Streptococcus gordonii Adhesin CshA Protein Binds Host Fibronectin via a Catch-Clamp Mechanism.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Journal of biological chemistry</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2939d5850ace7ecb491c9d02ad7f838d"><gtr:id>2939d5850ace7ecb491c9d02ad7f838d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Back CR</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0021-9258</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58be80c94b4b56.93136189</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B349079E-470F-4DE7-B605-C8EB9EB1EE8A</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Assembly Line Enzymology of Polyketide Biosynthesis.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/95e3bd0e56dcdb4a5dfb1e7f55dfbe52"><gtr:id>95e3bd0e56dcdb4a5dfb1e7f55dfbe52</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Till M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1064-3745</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56d9edafda1086.95426879</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2A88653F-ED82-443D-8F79-0CEEB56A542D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of the bacillaene synthase trans-acting acyltransferase PksC.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Acta crystallographica.
