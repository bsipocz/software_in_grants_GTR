Three key developments include: 1) &amp;quot;Trajectory shaping&amp;quot; for ARFMS vessel movement to avoid instability and spillage. This work will have two aspects i) Software filter (work package 1) &amp;amp; ii) Vessel design (work package 2). 2) &amp;quot;Robot supervision&amp;quot; which is closely linked with the above, (work packages 1, 2, 3 and 4). This will involve monitoring with sensors what is going on inside the vessel movement wise with a view to developing a feedback loop to the robot to adjust trajectory and speed. 3) Hygiene compliance and BRC accreditation, (work package 5). 

Food industry technical compliance expertise at the NCFM will be utilised together with an independent food hygiene consultancy to define the cleaning and technical control standards demanded by the food processing sector. This expertise will develop solutions for these challenges and will validate these solutions via a series of industrial scale trials in the NCFM manufacturing facility with an objective of full compliance to BRC Global Standard for Food, Issue 7. 

ARFMS will utilise small processing vessels (weighing up to 1000Kgs when full) seamlessly moved by robot from process docking station to process docking station with no pumps or pipework and all instrumentation and control systems contained within the process workhead (lid), robot and installation. The robot will select and connect with the appropriate processing workhead, e.g. ingredient dispensing, mixing, homogenising, cooking, cooling and packing, depending on product being produced, and accurately locate onto the open vessel for activation of the processing cycle. 

The project plan has been realistically constructed by the project team. It is proposed to comprise of six separate Work Packages and seven Project Milestones covering one or more work packages: WP1 (Milestones 1&amp;amp;2) - Modelling System Dynamics (5 months). Mathematical modelling of robot tasks, installation and use of small scale robot to validate algorithms generated. WP2 (MS3) - Optimal Vessel Design &amp;amp; Model Variances (4 months, 3 months running concurrently with WP1 ). This will ensure that movement speed, accuracy and efficiency are maximised without spillage of contents or system damage. WP3 (MS4) - Integration of System Model into Commercial Controls (3 months). Algorithms derived from WP1 and 2 will be integrated into the large size commercial Kuka Titan KR1000 robot. WP4 (MS5) - Full Scale Evaluation (4 months). This will evaluate the modelling and vessel developments on the large scale test system at NCFM's Holbeach facility producing real food products. WP5 (MS6) - Hygienic Design of Automated Robotic Food Manufacturing System (12 months running concurrently with other work packages). To investigate and implement suitable hygienic standard compliance measures into the system. WP6 (MS7) - Project conclusions, future development, dissemination events and commercial exploitation.

UoL's team consists of robotics, fluid dynamics, food manufacturing and science specialists and comprehensvie research facilities. Specialist sub-contractor, Food Fix Ltd, will provide independent hygiene expertise based on the British Retail Consortium's Global Food Safety Standard which is the internationally recognised food industry Technical Standard. The overall project, its partners and individual work packages will be closely managed by OAL's experienced Project Manager who has successfully managed other collaborative R&amp;amp;D projects.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>There has only been incremental development of food processing systems during the last 30 years with minor improvements to individual pieces of equipment. The food industry is the UK's largest manufacturing sector forecast to be &amp;pound;113.1Bn in 2018-19 (Sources: Food Manufacture.co.uk and BDO), but unlike other manufacturing industries, e.g. automotive, electronics and aerospace, there has been little progress in automating food manufacturing due to the lack of enabling technology and low cost labour. The industry has relied on traditional cooking and processing methodologies which are extremely labour intensive, inefficient, and produce inconsistent and relatively low product quality with high wastage and energy costs. State of the art food processing generally consists, at best, of automated recipe control, guiding operators through the production process; some automated traceability systems; and automated pumped product transfer and cleaning regimes. However, current systems still rely on product being transferred from one bulk storage / processing vessel to another in order for the next production operation to be carried out, relying on a high degree of manual handling and operator interface. Transfer systems not only damage product through use of pumps and pipe work, but generate waste left in the system. 

Food manufacturers are now having to seek alternative production methods due to: the highly competitive nature of food processing; continuing downward pressure on costs from retailers and consumers; demand for increased variety, fresher, better and healthier products requiring smaller batch production runs; ever more stringent health and safety and environmental legislation; and the national minimum wage increasing to &amp;pound;9 per hour by 2020. This step change, initially for soup, sauce and liquid based products, will be achieved through the innovative combination of disruptive and proven enabling technologies. With the availability of such technologies, including L's revolutionary patented, Steam Infusion process, (number 20140064988), advanced automation capabilities and robotics, automated food production on an industrial scale can now become reality through ARFMS (Automated Robotic Food Manufacturing System). The fully integrated ARFMS system will enable and apply Industry 4.0 (Digital Manufacturing) technologies for the benefit of food manufacturers by connecting physical and digital manufacturing across various sizes of business, ultimately enabling &amp;quot;end to end flexible automation&amp;quot; of a food factory. The system will produce consistent, better quality products, faster, whilst significantly reducing wastage and energy costs, and taking up to 50% less factory space. The flexibility that ARFMS provides overcomes the barriers that automation and the use of robotics for food manufacturing has suffered to date.

Summarised, the key innovative aspects of ARFMS are: i) Automated robotic hygienic food processing system, (UK Patent application no. 1517271.1 and International PCT/GB2016/053005 submitted); ii) Use of smaller mobile (750-1000Kg) vessels, allowing small or repeatable larger scale production, quickly moved between processing stations by advanced robotics; iii) Processing workheads selected and fitted to open vessels by robot; iv) All instruments and control equipment will be located in the processing workheads, robot and installation, not in the open vessels.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>139325</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R005524/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5CBA14F4-F235-45B6-A9DD-5937D5C166CC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>5</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Electrical Engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>53F27348-198B-4AEF-A34B-8307067F507C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>95</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Systems engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>21CE2EA6-E7A2-4406-A045-0DA7CA19B695</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>95</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Control Engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6624C9D3-BA2C-4506-9A85-9816946CA97A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>5</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Robotics &amp; Autonomy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
