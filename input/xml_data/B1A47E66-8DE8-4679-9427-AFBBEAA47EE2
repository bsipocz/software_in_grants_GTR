1879-1914</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/I021671/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This research project explores the histories and legacies of British investment in Chilean nitrate mines and involvement in its global trafficking. Through an examination of sites, artefacts and images, the project will trace nitrate's route from natural mineral state processed in the oficinas (works) of the Atacama desert through transported commodity and stock market exchange value to become, ultimately, part of the material and symbolic inheritances of London mansions and of estates in the capital's surrounding countryside. It undertakes new audio and visual documentation of geographically disparate but historically connected landscapes, remote nitrate fields and metropolitan financial districts, accompanied by an analysis of nitrate's material and visual culture. \n\nAs a basic ingredient of both fertilizers and explosives, nitrate was intimately connected with the industrialization of life and death, yet an account of its production and trade, including the pivotal role played by British merchant houses and adventure capitalists, is quite unfamiliar beyond specific research communities devoted to Latin America economic development. Thus, the project entitled Traces of Nitrate, directly addresses a lack of historical understanding and cultural awareness of the significance of the nitrate industry by disseminating its research through a photographic exhibition, video installation, programme of public events as well as scholarly publications aimed at interest groups in and outside the university sector. Seeking to uncover the extent to which a once highly prized mineral was at the centre of the relationship between Britain and Chile between 1879 and 1914 and how, in this period between the beginning of the Pacific War and the outbreak of the First World War, it was connected to fortunes of City of London, ports of Liverpool, Pisagua and Iquique, the research will also locate nitrate within a process of globalization shaped not only by the expansion of consumer culture but also by the extraction and depletion of non-renewable resources. \n\nThe 'trace' of the project's title thus refers to a process of delineation as well as to the objects of inquiry: the physical remains. Their transformation over time will be carefully mapped to create 'biographies' of nitrate artefacts, paying close attention to how mineral wealth has been collected or allowed to disappear and to the preservation or regeneration of twentieth century landscapes of finance. Sustained archival research will enable the identification of particular places and objects but these records of nitrate industry (for example, photographs within the Fondo Fotogr&amp;aacute;fico Fundaci&amp;oacute;n Universidad de Navarra or papers of Antony Gibbs and Son, Guildhall Library) will be also scrutinized as representations that deploy categories of the 'foreign' or 'familiar', define land as a commodity or as a nation and cast the character of the financial investor or identity of nitrate miner. Assembling and analyzing these spatial, visual and material records will indicate where British and Chilean histories converge and separate allowing insights into the selective process of remembering and forgetting the past.\nTraces of Nitrate engages with three fields of current academic inquiry: visual cultures of colonialism; contemporary photographic practice; the material culture and heritage of conflict. Its scope is dependent upon the different expertise of Ribas (PI) and Purbrick (Co-I) in documentary photography and the interpretation of visual and material culture, respectively, and their overlapping interest in the investigation of contested spaces and unequally shared legacies. As part of the project, they will jointly supervise a doctoral student. Traces of Nitrate is conducted in collaboration with partners in Chile, Spain and Britain: Universidad UNIACC, Santiago, Universidad de Navarra, Pamplona, Virreina Centre de la Imatge, Barcelona, Open Eye Gallery, Liverpool.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>International exchange and cultural understanding\nA long term aim of the Traces of Nitrate project is to increase understanding of international interconnections across Britain and Chile; it is thus appropriate that the development of the research and its dissemination is based on cultivation of relationships between educational and cultural institutions based in the European and American continents. That four partners (Universidad UNIACC, Universidad de Navarra, Virreina Centre de la Imatge, Open Eye Gallery) have agreed to participate in and support the project is evidence of confidence that it will bring economic, educational and cultural benefits to their institutions and the communities they serve in Chile, Spain and Britain. Our partnership will develop through sharing local, subject specialist knowledge and professional expertise; it is characterised by an international reciprocity that will ensure that benefits are spread across the project. Knowledge transfer is embedded in the research process: the documentation in Chile will develop a working relationship with UNIACC; the curating of the touring exhibition will be a collaborative effort with Virreina Centre de Imatge. The planning of conferences and public events at Universidad de Navarra and the Open Eye Gallery will place local collections and regional images within in global histories creating a dialogue between institutions that will extend to their audiences. \nCultural engagement: addressing different publics \nTouring exhibition\nPublic exhibitions are cultural events that provide a space in which people can explore histories and identities. They are key tools for making research available without precondition, such as enrolment in an educational programme. Traces of Nitrate will address a general audience at each of its tour venues (Barcelona, Brighton, Santiago, Liverpool) and a series of related events will involve a wide range of specific interest groups in each location, including, for example, local historians and archaeologists, photographers, artists, art critics, heritage professionals, families of former nitrate miners and Latin American communities in Britain. English-Spanish and Spanish-English translation will facilitate both public and interest group participation. Furthermore, as well as providing access to new research in arts and humanities and enabling participation in educational forums, Traces of Nitrate will contribute to creative economies and community development in the manner typical of public exhibitions.\nWebsite communities\nA project website is an integral part of the process making research widely available and fulfils the responsibility for openness expected of any publicly funded project. An important function of the Traces of Nitrate website will be to facilitate contact between university researchers and practitioners and those outside the university sector encouraging the participation of English and Spanish speaking on-line communities devoted to advancing discussion about the interpretation of contemporary heritage and development of sites of conflict, the use of photography. The website will also be used to house a digital archive of the touring exhibition and its related events, extending their impact beyond their immediate local audience. \nDeveloping Heritage Policies and Practices\nHeritage is an important point of popular access to history. Participants in the field of heritage are diverse, encompassing tourists, local activists seeking conservation or re-development, heritage managers and policy-makers. All play a part in the stewardship of the historic environment and their ability to learn, explain, record or protect it will be enhanced through the creation of new visual documentation and historical information relating to the heritage of the nitrate trade in Britain and Chile and its specific sites in the Atacama</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-02-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>264357</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Developed as three large, detailed photographs and two found images, alongside artist's texts and copies of original documentation, It Would Never Be Quite The Same Again weaves together histories associated with contested sites and acts of dissent. The works interrogate a number of events and documents construed as distant echoes, in the recent history of Chile, Great Britain and Spain, of the detonations in the late 19th and early 20th century nitrate fields of the Atacama Desert. The series is an appendix to Ribas' long term project Nitrate, presented in 2014 at the Museu d'Art Contemporani de Barcelona [MACBA], and conjures up a wide network of interconnected geographies and histories, of personal and collective memories on the distinctive political contexts of Spain and Chile around 1973, and on historical relationships between Chile and Great Britain - Ribas' country of residence since 2000 - which are at the heart of the Nitrate project. For both bodies of work, the Atacama Desert operates as a vanishing point.</gtr:description><gtr:id>2755F97E-6F74-4C98-897D-86E40764D0C5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>On the occasion of the exhibition I was invited to do a talk about the work at the Universitat Polit&amp;egrave;cnica de Val&amp;egrave;ncia: http://cargocollective.com/tracesofnitrate/filter/Events/2015-Universitat-Politecnica-de-Valencia

The works interrogate a number of events and documents construed as distant echoes, in the recent history of Chile, Great Britain and Spain, of the detonations in the late 19th and early 20th century nitrate fields of the Atacama Desert. The series is an appendix to Ribas' long term project Nitrate, presented in 2014 at the Museu d'Art Contemporani de Barcelona [MACBA], and conjures up a wide network of interconnected geographies and histories, of personal and collective memories on the distinctive political contexts of Spain and Chile around 1973, and on historical relationships between Chile and Great Britain - Ribas' country of residence since 2000 - which are at the heart of the Nitrate project. For both bodies of work, the Atacama Desert operates as a vanishing point.</gtr:description><gtr:id>4152CB10-EC54-4549-B927-BDAD7278182D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Exhibition review in Frieze: http://www.frieze.com/issue/review/xavier-ribas/

In different ways, using both academic and artistic practices, participants in the Visuality, Materiality and Mining symposium considered the global inequalities of extractive industries, their affects upon land and people, examining how raw materials, exploded, prised or pumped from beneath the surface of earth, appear in industrial and post-industrial cultures. 

The symposium aimed at investigating how mined landscapes are or can be represented, hoping to edge towards a better understanding of the mobilities and entanglements of mined materials, their material and political effects.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56deed3a991bb0.49524444</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://arts.brighton.ac.uk/whats-on/sallis-benney-events/theatre-2015/jun-2015/visuality,-materiality-and-mining</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The outcome of the Traces of Nitrate research have been the subject of a number of national and international conferences, seminars, symposiums, exhibitions and publications. The dissemination through exhibition, conference papers, workshops and publications, of documentation of nitrate mining and its legacies in Chile and Britain contributed to new understanding of historical relationships of unequal distribution of wealth between Europe and Latin America. The research continues to attract interest and several publications and exhibitions are in process. 

The research is now part of World of Matter (http://www.worldofmatter.net), a multimedia project providing an open access archive on the global ecologies of resource exploitation and circulation, and Temporary School of Experimental Geography (http://tsoeg.org), an itinerant network of artists sharing ideas and responses to landscape through fieldwork.

Several presentations and publications have articulated this relationship.

Communities of interest in Barcelona, Madrid, Navarra, Santiago, Liverpool, including photographers, local historians, archeologists, curators, students were provided with forums through which to consider the significance of legacies of nitrate mining in their local histories and economies.

The history of nitrate mining between Britain and Chile has now been included in wider analysis of the visual culture and political ecology of Latin America. 

The trade route of nitrate (Atacama Desert, Iquique and Pisagua, Liverpool, London) was identified as well as the use of nitrate as fertiliser in northern Europe and as a component of Allied shell manufacture in the First World War. 

Strategies of recording and interpreting forms of heritage that encourage on-going debate about past of economic exploitation have been developed through the Traces of Nitrate project.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Following an invitation by Professor Liz Wells (https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/staff/liz-wells), the team has submitted a book proposal to Bloomsbury (http://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/) on the subject of mining and photography which would pay special attention to the Traces of Nitrate research materials and the papers presented at the symposium Visuality, Materiality and Mining (http://tracesofnitrate.org/filter/Events/2015-Visuality-Materiality-and-Mining-Symposium) held at the University of Brighton on 25-26 June 2015. The proposal is for a new series of books on Photography, Geography and Environment.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5A5C68D5-89E7-4444-BE2A-27FE2A21D301</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56ddb2d6a62d71.89084661</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Environment,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://tracesofnitrate.org</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>World of Matter is a multimedia project providing an open access archive on the global ecologies of resource exploitation and circulation.</gtr:description><gtr:id>326ACDAF-BA75-4B1E-81DF-DD39095484D5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Participation in future international group exhibitions and conferences, such as World of Matter, Nash Gallery and Wiseman Gallery, University of Minnesota Campus, September 2017.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dd6c01bf1400.14936372</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>World of Matter Website</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.worldofmatter.net</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Web repository of the Traces of Nitrate research project, including photographic works, conference papers, publications, exhibitions, reviews, awards and fieldwork documents.</gtr:description><gtr:id>4672CD26-02B1-4E64-B0FB-F79DF240CF07</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The web has only been active recently.
