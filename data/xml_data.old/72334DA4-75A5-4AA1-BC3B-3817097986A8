We foresee a range of economic impacts for the industrial biotechnology sector, specifically in animal health and medical diagnostics (through the lead industry partner, Clarity Biosolutions Ltd). Farmers and the broader agricultural industry will also stand to benefit in the longer term from potentially improved monitoring and rapid in-field testing for disease.

Effective communication within the broader scientific community will be achieved through publication of non-commercially confidential outcomes in top-tier conferences and journals in the areas of bio-sensing, instrumentation veterinary and public health. Specifically the partners will target the International Conference of Biosensing Technology. The lead partner will attend relevant trade shows e.g Medica.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>200155</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>EI have developed a fast and robust method for detecting the presence and genotype of PRRSV in pig saliva samples, we aim to make this available via the Genomics NCG at Earlham</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The methodology developed could be used in other labs.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>AAF78B61-4525-44C0-B467-C33FEAC560A4</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56cf2100b47447.56888244</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a positive-sense RNA virus which infects domestic pigs. The PRRS disease is now the most economically important disease for the global pig industry. PRRSV has a very high mutation rate, which makes efficient control and vaccination extremely difficult. Therefore, diagnostic assays to detect and monitor the genetic diversity of PRRSV are needed.
Our laboratory based diagnostics pipeline allows us to detect and quantify low levels of PRRSV in pig saliva samples, then verify the result and identify the specific genotype by DNA sequencing. Saliva samples are preserved in RNA Shield? upon collection, which inactivates the virus and stabilises the RNA for transport at ambient temperatures to the laboratory. RNA is extracted from the saliva, reverse transcribed into cDNA, and then analysed by quantitative PCR (qPCR). The resulting amplicons can be verified by sanger sequencing or a high throughput sequencing platform. Nanopore sequencing is ideal for this application as it can sequence amplicons of any length as a single read, which allows us to identify the specific PRRSV genotype with greater ease.</gtr:description><gtr:id>A5C9DBC0-CE28-4AAB-BA9C-E63C3DB88A67</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This pipeline is a fast and robust method for detecting the presence and genotype of PRRSV in pig saliva samples, we aim to make this available via the Genomics NCG at Earlham.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ca7a9f82cbe1.44814977</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>PRRSV diagnostics - qPCR to sequencing pipeline</gtr:title><gtr:type>Technology assay or reagent</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2017</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>We have been developing software that will assist in the designing of novel Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) methods, especially new assays.
The software currently comprises of two parts: 
1) Assay setup and Design (AD) application. This enables the user to design primers for amplification. The user is able to choose from a drop down menu of NGS platform library adaptors or provide their own custom designs. Where the user has chosen to provide their own designs the application provides advice, and warnings with regards to the design structure of these adaptors. 
2) Library Analysis (LA) application uses PacBio reads to confirm the adaptor structure within the libraries. Due to the short insert sizes of Illumina libraries, and the long PacBio reads most molecules will be sequenced as CCS reads to &amp;gt;95% accuracy. ADLA then uses the adaptor structure from the adaptor setup and design application to orientate reads and perform a series of QC analysis.</gtr:description><gtr:id>C4F21449-928E-4996-9CA5-11ECB98DF3F4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Adapter Design and Library Analysis (ADLA) package will be a solution for the development of adaptor sequences for novel applications using NGS platforms, especially Illumina. It also provides an analysis suite for the quality control of potentially problematic libraries using as little as a single SMRTcell of PacBio sequence data.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ca79c9a88c92.66158904</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Assay Design and Library Analysis (ADLA)</gtr:title><gtr:type>Software</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2017</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/N00387X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>48D25546-6ADF-479A-8877-478CCDB1DC1F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Animal Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>9BDF80E2-029E-4505-B7EE-DB0FA633E483</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Omic sciences &amp; technologies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FB535BD0-E265-4C0A-8532-32DCB83A3951</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tools, technologies &amp; methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A502D25A-BB70-4F74-844D-32A2BAD075A5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Animal Diseases</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4661C82D-F66E-4672-BA82-7C12180BBDF7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Genomics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B76F0E6B-0363-4D1F-9F5F-353AFD4E9DB0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Livestock production</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3493671D-A4CF-4197-90A7-3CCFBE1C0627</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tools for the biosciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
