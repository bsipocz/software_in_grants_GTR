A large scale multi-method study investigating the working conditions in the UK, found evidence of financial exploitation by management, and poor working conditions and facilities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>These findings provided the impetus for an impact project that was designed collaboratively with key stakeholders: Local Authorities Licensing Committees and the Institute of Licensing.&amp;nbsp;The research has had significant impact and reach, and has led to improved licensing conditions under the first phase of the new Sex Entertainment Venues (SEV) policies. The project had at its core co-production of resources through consultation with the strip industry, particularly with dancers. The follow-up project had 4 key aims:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>to&amp;nbsp;produce a series of 5 bespoke briefing papers and summaries based on the research findings&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>deliver seminars and presentations for licensing practitioners, policy makers, business owners/managers and labour organisations&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>the development of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dancersinfo.co.uk/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>Dancers Info website&lt;/a> and Iphone application for dancers, in partnership with dancers, HMRC and Suzy Lamplugh Trust.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Aim/activity 2 enable direct impact upon policy-makers, whilst Aim/Activity 3 gave information and advice in a mobile accessible format to the community of dancers.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The beneficiaries and users of this project span a wide range of audiences. Firstly, those involved in managing and organising the lap dancing industry, some of whom were participants in the initial research, will be recipients of the findings. Second, dancers will receive summaries from the findings and also benefit from a bespoke set of workshops and information around safety, tax compliance and workplace rights. Permanent resources will be created to be cascaded down to as many clubs and dancers as possible, through induction packs used in the clubs. Also, these materials will be permanently on a website. Third, five briefing papers will be written for the specific audiences of: licensing and enforcement officers, local authority regulators, unions, safety organisations, industry management. Fourth, these briefing papers will be delivered through targetted seminars to the above audiences where their specific agenda's can be addressed. Finally, HM Revenu &amp;amp; Customs Business Partnership team will benefit from access and the ability to conduct targetted work at this hard to reach industry. Some of these groups have competing interests so bespoke seminars addressing their concerns and interests is the most effective way in which to make the research findings active and applicable. 

The ways in which the beneficiaries may benefit from the research are far reaching. We anticipate that the dancers are the most likely group to benefit both directly and indirectly. Through direct consultation and workshops with the dancers, we hope to improve the knowledge and skills that these workers have regarding their workplace rights and the advantages of being tax compliant. We also hope that some club owners and managers take on board the issues that have been reported to the researchers regarding the conditions under which they work. For instance, more information regarding safety, personal insurance and the tax system will enable dancers to fully understand their status as self employed independent contractors. We estimate 6,000 dancers could receive the information. 

At a policy level, the audiences of Local Government Regulators and licensing officers are involved with directly creating and enforcing policy. The follow-on funding maps onto a change in law during 2010, which overhauled the way in which lap dancing venues are licensed. During 2011 all Local Authorities will be consulting and drafting policy relating to the new law. One new aspect of the law is that local Licensing Committees now have the power to stipulate precise conditions of the license. It is under this power that we hope to influence policy so that welfare and working conditions are included in the licensing process. This has already been achieved with the Leeds City Council Licensing Committee (Bristol, Cornwall and West Dorset also) who have taken on some or all of the recommendations from the research findings. One of the key areas we hope to impact upon is to raise and review the safety strategies in clubs, particularly around private booths. Working with workplace safety experts the Suzy Lamplugh Trust and local project Genesis, the safety concerns of dancers will be a core focus, producing best practice for safety inside and outside the clubs. This will be supported by the work of the West Yorkshire Police Community Safety Team. Finally, HM Revenue &amp;amp; Customs will seek tax compliance from a small percentage of dancers. 

There will also be an academic impact. Firstly, this will relate to the innovative dissemination tool, the Inforgraphic Summary, which will be written up as a useful visual aide to presenting large data to non-academic audiences. Secondly, the academic outputs will contribute to the gender and work debates, placing lap dancing in the broader context of the political economy of work. This will directly feed into teaching modules and postgraduate supervision at the University of Leeds which have a strong research-led approach.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>95065</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Institute of Licensing</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Institute of Licensing</gtr:description><gtr:id>659F5012-9843-4A75-A97B-907887C16516</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b9573d16b9573d2a-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>Both the PI and the Researcher have worked closely with the Institute of Licensing to disseminate knowledge from the research project and the work with dancers and Local Authorities around licensing conditions.

Influencing SEV Policy and Licensing Conditions
? Direct work with licensing practitioners (one to one meetings) and training events where research findings and recommendations have been transmitted to Licensing Committees in 20 Local Authorities. Briefings have been sent via the Local Government Authority through their e-bulletin to 3,000 officers in August 2011 and March 2012. The research reports and recommendations have been used in license hearings by solicitors and twice in court cases. 
? Through the Institute of Licensing we have conducted training events/seminars with 8 /11 regions across the UK, with some 300+ licensing practitioners and police attending. Plus a training event at the IOL annual training conference in November 2012 to capture those outside the regions, giving maximum transmission of findings.
? As a result there has been significant influence and inclusion of our recommendations, on how to improve dancer welfare, safety and good practice in management during the first phase of the new Sex Entertainment Venue Policies written by the majority of LA's across England and Wales. 
2. Industry Involvement in Changing Working Conditions
Four seminars with the industry from the following cities were held: Aberdeen (30/31Jan 2012) London (28 June 2012), Manchester (18 June 2012), Leeds (10 July 2012), Blackpool (31 May 2012), Cardiff (13 June 2012) capturing managers from at least 50/200 venues. These industry representatives have contributed to the gold standards of good practice which are being promoted to the Licensing Committee's as well as within their own clubs. 

3. Resource for Dancers

We have now created a permanent, accessible and mobile resource for dancers consisting of essential information about personal safety at work; tax awareness; and self-employment information through an Iphone App and Website for Dancers: http://www.dancersinfo.co.uk/
Key 'top tips' on the website are written in English, Romainian, Portuguese, Spanish, Polish and Russian with corresponding promotional material. 

4) Media / Public Engagement
Broader public engagement has been extensive through the broadsheets and tabloid press. For example: Preliminary findings launch August, 2010, in the Independent, which was further reported by 26 media outlets and in 6 languages),

Finished in 2011, this is the largest study of the strip-based entertainment industry to date, adds to this extensive research repertoire by making theoretical and empirical advances to our existing knowledge of gender based social issues around employment and the rise of sexual consumption. The operation of strip clubs needed to be examined in relation to: a) the broader processes of urban governance and structural integration of sexual consumption businesses in the city and night time economy; b) the working conditions of dancers and the entrance routes that create 'supply'; c) the relationships between regulatory processes, corporate and independent club ownership and the management of the night time economy. The study (consisting of a survey of 197 dancers and 70 interviews) focused on women who operate in the strip-based entertainment industry in the UK, and produced the following key findings:

1. The vast majority of dancers had made a decision to do dancing/stripping as a flexible, relatively high earning (although unpredictable), cash-in-hand form of work.

2. Most women did not report any violence and felt safe in their workplace due to security and door personnel, however, there was some reporting of unwanted touching and harassment from customers.

3. There was no evidence of organised prostitution or trafficking / forced involvement.

4. Most dancers were concerned about the high fees, commissions and fines they were paying to the management, especially on occasions when they were taking relatively little money home. 70% of respondents said they had left a shift without earning any money.

5. There was overall concern amongst dancers that their welfare and working conditions were not being taken seriously by the new legislation introduced in the Policing and Crime Act, 2009 that set out a new Sex Entertainment Venue licensing process but rather assumptions were being made about exploitation and the community's views were favoured against dancers.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The project was all about dissemination to the striptease industry, the Licensing fraternity in the UK which is made up of licensing officers, Local Authority Licensing Committees and the Institute of Licensing. At the heart of the project was consultation with female dancers and other workers in the industry, so that the resources that were designed and produced were informed by their experiences, needs and understanding of their work. Equally policy recommendations we promoted to Local Authority Licensing Committees and practitioners were informed by dancers, managers and owners in the business who strive for a regulated, tolerated and professional industry free from stereotypes and myths about the work.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>28519A57-DFF7-49F6-9520-CD7C67F507F0</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-2045115374.0706995b2f37a0c</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.sociology.leeds.ac.uk/assets/files/research/Regulatory_Dance/Summarylapdancedisseminationprojleedsunijune2012.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>DDC24DF3-8618-4F02-8620-425DEEBC0577</gtr:id><gtr:title>The regulatory dance : sexual consumption in the night time economy</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/0976d8f311ce5a1a1040acf2a1afbf81"><gtr:id>0976d8f311ce5a1a1040acf2a1afbf81</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Teela Sanders (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>r_3609903954cb3ee294</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B5551A29-44C7-435A-B48D-CBD91DA1796A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Regulating Strip-Based Entertainment: Sexual Entertainment Venue Policy and the Ex/Inclusion of Dancers&amp;acirc;??
