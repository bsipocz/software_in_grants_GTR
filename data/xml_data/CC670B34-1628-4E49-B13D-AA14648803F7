It will protect the environment and public health by reducing open burning of biomass wastes such as rice straw, corn cobs or coconut shells and husks. These biomass waste materials will instead become feedstock for renewable energy production in biogasification plants. The main project focus is on testing the suitability of biochar, the solid residue of the biogasification process, for environmental pollution control and nutrient recovery, thus realizing multiple benefits at the intersection of the food, energy, water and environment sectors.
The UK-Thai research collaboration will test the suitability of biochars produced from different agricultural waste materials under different pyrolysis conditions as sorbent material to prevent entry of toxic chemicals such as heavy metals or pesticides or petroleum hydrocarbons from polluted canal water into the food-chain of aquaculture ponds, where they could bioaccumulate and ultimately affect the consumers of shrimp, fish and other aquaculture products. Our project will test the hypothesis that biochars can be used in water biofiltration designs to enhance retention of toxic chemicals and facilitate the break-down of biodegradable pollutants such as pesticides or petroleum hydrocarbons present in canal water which feeds ponds. We will also test the hypothesis that biochars can be directly applied to aquaculture pond sediments to bind up sediment pollutants and prevent their uptake into the aquaculture food-chain. After harvest, the aquaculture ponds themselves can become the source of nutrient rich wastewaters which, if discharged into canals without treatment, will cause eutrophication of canal water and damage ecosystems. Instead of discharging nutrients into sensitive ecosystems, it would be better to recover them for use in agriculture, replacing inorganic fertilizers. The project will therefore also test the hypothesis that biochars can bind and recover nutrients from aquaculture wastewater. Contrary to more traditional wastewater treatment options based on the nitrification-denitrification process, the new process will not release precious nutrients as molecular nitrogen into the atmosphere, from where nitrogen has to be fixed again with the energy-intensive Haber-Bosch process for use in agriculture. Instead, the nutrients will be sorbed onto biochars which can then be applied to fields as slow-release fertilizer or used as nutrient source in hydroponic systems. The project will experimentally investigate the feasibility of these innovative concepts using real Thai agricultural waste materials for the production of biochar, and real canal and aquaculture pond waters and sediments for evaluating the proposed treatment methods. Water and sediment treatment design models will be calibrated and verified with the measured experimental data and utilized to optimize the proposed designs. Researchers from King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi (KMUTT) in Bangkok and Newcastle University in the UK will share responsibility for the delivery of this project, and will exchange biochar production &amp;amp; characterisation, chemical analysis, water treatment design and field work expertise. 
Stakeholders from Kasetsart University, the Water Quality Management Office, and Thai farmers will be engaged in two public workshops, and through the field work at an aquaculture farm. This project seeks to invert the current problematic inter-dependencies in the Food-Energy-Water-Environment Nexus into future mutually beneficial inter-linkages which will make the rural economy more sustainable. The project will create new economic opportunities, and contribute to innovation in an area of global significance.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project seeks to invert the current problematic inter-dependencies described by the Food-Energy-Water-Environment Nexus into future mutually beneficial inter-linkages between food, energy and water provision, which will make the Thai and the global rural economy more sustainable. The project will develop new environmental engineering solutions for waste valorisation, water treatment and nutrient recovery, and thereby create new business opportunities in the rural economy, and contribute to innovation in an area of global significance. The Thai researchers will benefit from the state-of-the art facilities at Newcastle University in the UK for analysis of metal and organic pollutants (LC-MS/GC-MS/ICP-MS) at the School of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, and for biochar characterization at the Northern Carbon Research Laboratory. Risk assessment trainings, wastewater treatment design trainings, and hands-on analytical trainings will be provided for the Thai researchers by the UK partners, and in kind by the Newcastle University spin-out company Enviresearch Ltd, which provides regulatory and risk assessment services in Europe. The UK researchers will benefit from the Thai expertise in large scale biochar production and their understanding of the Thai rural economy, and from the access to aquaculture farms where innovative water and sediment treatment and nutrient recovery methods can be pilot trialed. Thai stakeholders from the Water Quality Management Office of the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration will not only facilitate this research by providing local water quality expertise, but will also gain additional knowledge of the chemical status of Thai surface water resources, and innovative water treatment methods for protecting the water environment through their engagement with this project. Research partners from Kasetsart University will not only help the project in kind with their biochar production facilities and expertise, but will also through their engagement in this project learn more about innovative and high value applications of biochar in water treatment and nutrient recovery. The Thai aquaculture farmers, and their communal technology transfer center in the Bang Khun Thian district, will not only enable this project by providing access to their farms, but will also learn about new business opportunities such as new agricultural waste valorisation methods, inexpensive and sustainable water treatment methods, and nutrient recovery methods for their aquacultures. This project will built innovation capacity in Thailand for the sustainable protection of water resources, on which the livelihood of millions of people depends, for the sustainable production of safe and healthy food in well managed aquacultures, and for the valorisation of agricultural waste materials in bioenergy and biochar production, which produces less air pollution than open field biomass burning. The technologies investigated and the innovation capacity built through this project will create new economic opportunities in rural Thailand, and establish sustainable engineering skills and expertise which can then radiate across the region from the beacons of expertise at KMUTT and Kasetsart University, from Thailand into neighboring low income countries such as Laos and Myanmar, and across the Southeast region. Sustainable and inexpensive solutions to resolve the current Food-Energy-Water-Environment Nexus are needed not only in Southeast Asia, but globally, and through a successful delivery of the project the UK-Thai partnership can make a significant advancement towards the aim of greater sustainability.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-08-12</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-02-13</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>72015</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/P027709/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5B25B6A3-B218-4F11-8A9D-661236DF455C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agri-environmental science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F95121C7-7C31-40CE-BDBC-1E2BF025AEA6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Energy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>97FC8337-8E84-46A6-ACF2-A6047DA8C582</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environmental Engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C9A78518-54CF-4145-A680-F2BDCFB3913B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pollution, waste &amp; resources</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>794345CD-A1D5-4984-ADDD-088BCF41822F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agricultural systems</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>68D4AB6A-88C3-4368-8A94-2DADEEF21FF5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Bioenergy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DC6B2467-35B6-4997-9582-1BF957B82697</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pollution</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>0B6F999D-9DC2-4BDE-A15B-6A212E9ADB62</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Waste Management</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A600D1CC-E752-4522-95BC-916168B6C71B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Waste Minimisation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>C11BDEA9-7D9D-4728-B6A9-31032921B328</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Newton</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
