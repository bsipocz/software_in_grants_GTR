Sources of infectivity include diseased animal carcasses as well as bodily fluids from clinical or sub-clinical animals. If this infectivity persists and/or migrates within soil and soil-water then further cases of disease could ensue. In order to investigate this we are performing 2 large scale field experiments in which a series of 301V spiked bovine heads have been interred within soil-filled lysimeters. The heads are serially exhumed and samples collected from within and around the heads analysed for the presence of PrPSc by western blot and for infectivity by bioassay. In parallel, boluses of infectivity have been placed within much larger lysimeters. Soil core samples are collected at various time points and through analyses the aim is to detect the extent to which infectivity has disseminated. In both experiments 2 soil types have been used; a free-draining sandy loam soil and a water-retentive clay soil. Rainwater passing through the lysimeters is also being analysed. To date the year 1 and year 2 heads have been exhumed and core samples have been collected from the large bolus-containing lysimeters at 7 time points. A method for the extraction of PrPSc from soil has been developed and applied to the core samples, however no PrPSc has so far been detected. It was notable that whilst the year 1 and 2 bovine heads were largely decomposed, significant brain material remained within the brain cavity. Samples from both experiments have been extracted and panels of mice have been injected for bioassay. Laboratory studies suggest that TSE infectivity may bind strongly to soil components and is therefore likely to persist in the environment for a considerable period of time. It is envisaged that data acquired can be used to build a predictive model of TSE behaviour in the environment and could influence policy and risk assessment.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_PROJECTED</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>104350</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The conclusion is that BES infectivity within buried cattle carcases will survive with little sign of titre loss for at least 5 years, likely longer. As the burial site was outdoors, exposed to the Scottish weather, including very heavy rainfall, it was encouraging that there was little sign of movement of the infectivity very far into the soil surrounding the carcase. However infectivity and PrPSc were present in filtrates of rain water which had drained through the site up to two years following burial and this raises the concern that leakage of infectivity into ground water could occur. Risk assessments of contaminated sites should take these findings into account.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>I would expect those in charge the mass burial sites used for Foot and Mouth epidemic carcasses to take steps to protect ground water.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C5590211-B13A-4660-8B12-151B44FC1099</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c94d0542c930.65225703</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C9910705-5CB7-47A2-A2AC-6DB8BA949870</gtr:id><gtr:title>Transport of the pathogenic prion protein through soils.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of environmental quality</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c532967a84c6a2cfcce2c66a471c7d1d"><gtr:id>c532967a84c6a2cfcce2c66a471c7d1d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Jacobson KH</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0047-2425</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58c94c1feb6498.76344671</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A00DD310-0BED-4C4B-89CA-01719BC865F5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Fate of prions in soil: detergent extraction of PrP from soils.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Environmental science &amp; technology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/775d266b0f1fd0127ad0bba1f42a4e29"><gtr:id>775d266b0f1fd0127ad0bba1f42a4e29</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cooke CM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2007-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0013-936X</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58c94c2027b180.75882607</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BC458995-9837-4BDC-B1FE-8079F28350E2</gtr:id><gtr:title>A sensitive 301V BSE serial PMCA assay</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>F1000Research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8823940840d1a4f4c3237b16e690ace6"><gtr:id>8823940840d1a4f4c3237b16e690ace6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gough K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c94c352a5461.50199533</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BBS/E/A/00001666</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
