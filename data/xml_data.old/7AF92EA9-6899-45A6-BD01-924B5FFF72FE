Understanding the factors that limit population size is a challenging problem of widespread interest among ecologists, and also of vital importance to sound practice in conservation and environmental management. Traditionally, freshwater ecologists have focused on the aquatic, juvenile stages of insects, with considerably less attention devoted to the transition stages between the aquatic juveniles and terrestrial adults. We will concentrate on the recruitment of eggs from the terrestrial into the aquatic medium and the conversion of those eggs into neonates and help fill a substantial knowledge gap about the ecology of these life stages. It seems likely that either or both of these stages may act as populations 'bottlenecks'. Simply finding a suitable location to lay eggs may limit population size. Many stream insects lay their eggs on the underside of stream rocks that are emergent from the water's surface and we will test whether the supply of emergent rocks might limit egg recruitment. Further, egg-laying females may be influenced by the spatial arrangement of emergent rocks (egg-laying sites) and we will test also how this influences recruitment. Once the eggs hatch, the mobility of neonates will dictate whether or how long any localised effects of emergent rock limitation persist and, by measuring neonate movement, we will identify the spatial scale relevant to studies about population dynamics. Alternatively, effects of emergent rock limitation may be overwhelmed by high mortality of eggs or neonates, suggesting a different underlying mechanism for recruitment limitation. A lack of any pattern between emergent rocks, eggs and neonates, would suggest that populations size is set by different life stages and subsequent research efforts can be directed at those stages. Thus, our research will identify whether bottlenecks occur for egg and neonate life history stages, how strong those bottlenecks might be, and the spatial scales at which the restrictions occur. These results are of fundamental importance to ecological models of population dynamics. Information on how insects use emergent rocks, will be of use to river managers and rehabilitation projects.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>303236</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project made significant new discoveries in how the terrestrial physical environment can drive the abundance of freshwater insects over many different spatial scales. Most previous work in this area has focused on how the aquatic environment influence (e.g. water quality, hydraulics) influences the abundance of aquatic juveniles, whereas this project demonstrated that the availability of egg-laying sites and behaviours of the terrestrial, adult stages of aquatic insects can drive the abundance all life stages (eggs, juveniles, adults). This information is critical to river managers charged with restoring and conserving the biodiversity of riverine systems, but who have relatively little guidance on how to protect the majority of the aquatic species. Our research highlights some aspects of the importance of the terrestrial environment are essential to aquatic ecosystems and that can easily be incorporated into monitoring and restoration programmes. Our research outcomes have also resulted in a major shift in perspectives for freshwater ecology, i.e. previously, the received wisdom suggested that population dynamics of freshwater invertebrates (the majority of the freshwater fauna) were determined by events in the lives of aquatic juveniles, whereas our research indicates that the behaviour of adults during the brief egg-laying period can have profound consequences for populations. This new perspective has opened up new research avenues and new projects which examine and integrate events during all insect life stages, not just the juveniles. For example, these ideas sparked a PhD project recently completed by W. Bovill at the University of Melbourne, and were pivotal to a new, three-year research project recently funded by the Australian Research Council (DP160102262), &amp;quot;Explaining species diversity in a fractal world&amp;quot;. This new project is based at the University of Melbourne, but involves a research team of ecologists, geomorphologists and modelers from three universities in the UK and Australia. A further research proposal is currently being considered by the Australian Research Council and will involve a multidisciplined research team from four institutions in Australia and the USA. Thus, truly international collaborations and partnerships have arisen from this initial NERC-funded project, exciting new research questions have been identified and are being pursued.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In an academic context, this work is currently being developed and extended in new research grants (see 1. above).
