The sites selected for analysis are the ongoing excavation of Elephantine, in Aswan and material on permit in the UK from Qasr Ibrim. Environments and climate will be reconstructed, based on evidence from within and around settlement areas, in particular species from the natural insect fauna as well as those which live with man as uninvited guests and accidental travelers including insect pests, flies and ectoparasites. In addition, analytical techniques will be applied to material currently outside of Egypt either on permit or in museum collections. Both AMS dating and DNA of insect chitin will refine interpretation and produce new results.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Egypt has a rich archaeological record which Egyptian people are both proud of and interested in. This project will contribute to training archaeology inspectors/ University researchers in Egypt, providing them with the basic skills on site to assess and understand environmental archaeology and archaeoentomology. It will also provide laboratory basic training in the UK for a candidate enabling them to identify material and its interpretational potential, using relevant keys and collections. It will be an important step forward, for inspectors and archaeologists in Egypt to understand the details of environmental research, the benefits of this research, and the need for more analytical techniques to be applied to Egyptian archaeological sites. The appreciation of problems related with erosion of sites in Egypt in terms of preservation of material and its communication to archaeologists is another of the project's intended impacts on the archaeological professional community. Collaborations between Egypt and the UK and a network which aims to build links between Museums and Universities could also lead to better communication of the research to the public and to students in schools and Higher Education. In addition, involvement of University students in Cairo in educational activities led by project researchers, will provide them with a broader understanding of archaeology. The equipment bought will be available to excavations and researchers through the the Elephantine Island Museum and the Antiquities Inspectorate for use in research excavations, projects and educational purposes. The website will provide information on the project, contributed by all participants, both in Arabic and English. This will be a networking platform for all project researchers and also an opportunity for the public to communicate with the researchers. As part of project educational activities, local schools in Cairo and Aswan, in collaboration with Cairo and Aswan Museum, will be engaged in activities by the Egyptian researchers. This will enhance school curricula and also provide pupils with new educational experiences, combining the use of scientific equipment (stereomicroscopes) and new information regarding cultural heritage. The project aims to create pathways for public outreach in Egypt and to inspire a new generation of Egyptians to value and protect all aspects of cultural heritage. Similarly in the UK, through the project website, talks to local groups, such as the friends of Petrie Museum, through archaeological magazines, society newsletters, etc., the project will promote public outreach and will make the public aware of its objectives and results. Output will be by way of publication in scientific journals, papers presented at conferences, and communications with the Press and other media.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-02-12</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>31965</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>There are plans to educate school children in Egypt working with Museums in Cairo and Aswan and employees of the Ministry of Antiquities, which are currently pending as a result of delays from the Egyptian side.

An extension has been requested and decision is currently pending. Up to now research undertaken by the PI in Edinburgh has revealed the importance of the biogeography of introduced synanthropic species, which was the main focus of this research project. In particular, the distribution of pests of stored products, synanthropic flies, e.g. Musca domestica L., with possible origins in Egypt, and ectoparasites have revealed patterns which are important both in terms of changes in human environments and also in relation to the palaeoeconomy and early spread of diseases. Research on the material from the excavation at Qasr Ibrim, available on permit in the UK, is currently underway. Material has been selected and identified to species for radiocarbon dating by the Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator unit ORAU under the supervision of Professor T. Higham. This process is proceeding pending the commencement of the Egyptian part of the project. DNA project research by Dr Eva Fernandez and A. Simpson at the University of Durham has successfully tested a protocol for the extraction of DNA from desiccated fossil insect remains. DNA of fossil house flies, M. domestica, from Qasr Ibrim has been successfully extracted and compared to modern sequences. Further research from post Roman sites involves the analysis of material from the monastic site at Kom el Nana in middle Egypt, dated from coin evidence to the 4th to 6th century or perhaps a little later, and this is currently being prepared for publication. The fossil insect faunas from the site indicate not only stored products, probably flour and bread rather than grain, but also a much damper, irrigated environment. The dung fauna from the site is both diverse and extensive, with the larger scarabaeids suggesting cattle rather than smaller domesticates. The rest of the fauna, including click beetles, elaterids, in large numbers suggest proximity of grazing land, probably within the enclosure, although these may have been brought in with fodder from fields closer to the Nile. The insect material emphasises the range of introductions during the Roman period, with species of pests such as Callosobruchus maculatus F., perhaps of Asian origin, recovered. It also indicates extensive human impact. The differences between Kom el Nana and modern environments in the area and their insect faunas are significant as further intensification has led to a fauna impoverished of dung beetles.The fossil insect research clearly shows the scale of human impact and the extent of environmental change over time. It demonstrates the association of the changes with different management practices, providing relevant information for conservation of the environments along the Nile. 
 The part of the grant which will commence in Egypt will involve sampling from Elephantine in Aswan and training young scientists on fossil insect research as part of collaboration with the University of Cairo and the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities. This will run in parallel with fossil insect identification work in the UK from Qasr Ibrim. A website representing the project has been designed and populated and results will be on the web as soon as the Egyptian part of the project commences.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The project's findings are relevant for biogeographers, archaeologists and entomologists and conservation scientists. The results indicate the extent of human impact on the environments along the Nile, during different periods of time, in particular during the Roman and post Roman period. The DNA research on fossil insects will have implications for the field for future research in biogeography, palaeoentomology and climate change research.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>F567C7F7-E4FB-4592-BE7E-C45F4803AACE</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c69a2c0386a8.73904585</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Environment,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>55F51FBB-0593-445A-B32E-5A1990766DDA</gtr:id><gtr:title>A thousand bites - Insect introductions and late Holocene environments</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Quaternary Science Reviews</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/cf48cb504c18672f456bc02fc90a04e5"><gtr:id>cf48cb504c18672f456bc02fc90a04e5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Panagiotakopulu E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>588b70e9f21228.66051337</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/N009371/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Archaeology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F59367AF-7012-441B-9AD6-B360A3DFA96B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Landscape &amp; Environ.
