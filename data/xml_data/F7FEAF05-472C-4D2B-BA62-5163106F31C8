The programme aired after numerous warnings about the content and was included in the weekly roundup of the programme on the following weekend. On the podcast that day, emails were also read out with the audience reactions to the interview, which were highly encouraging and sometimes moving.

So far, the main impact has been that there has been a very public discussion of something that had previously been an issue that was completely off-limits in 'polite society'. Anecdotally many people have told me that it has helped them open up conversations that they previously would not have felt able to have. Talking about issues like this in a public forum allows others to have conversations about the conversation they just witnessed i.e. depersonalises the conversation and also allows it to be mentioned in the first place ('did you hear that programme on the radio?')</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>542c37230519e8.11234177</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p026sv9x</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Polluting bodies: young people's accounts of seeing, smelling and tasting and feeling sex</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E18F91E2-AC51-4552-BC3D-4775FFFC39CC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Talk led to discussion with other researchers about implications of the findings

The article draws out the main messages of the paper, calling for a focus on mutality and not consent in sex education. The purpose was to draw attention to different types of sexual coercion and begin a conversation in wider society about coercive anal heterosex.

The article was republished by The Washington Post, and the website informed me on the day that it was viewed &amp;gt;8000 times in the first few hours of publication. There was huge interest in the paper in general, but it seems likely that this article helped to bring the key messages to a wider audience and its popularity helped me to control the message, i.e. what was being shared came from me and not from a journalist.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>542c323de7d978.17024084</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://theconversation.com/all-too-often-anal-sex-isnt-about-young-womens-desires-30489</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Accounts of the sensory in young people's talk about sexual pratices</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CE159D5D-63B9-4E05-BBE0-3905168B5FB8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>546481bfac28d9.90375801</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:presentationType>paper presentation</gtr:presentationType><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://content.yudu.com/Library/A1ri7h/BSAAnnualConference2/resources/index.htm?referrerUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.yudu.com%2Fitem%2Fdetails%2F306351%2FBSA-Annual-Conference-2011---Full-Programme</gtr:url><gtr:year>2011</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Young people and sexualities (lecture)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8F4560C5-4666-4D7D-9EE8-1B7C2D3EBA6A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation of key findings from the study as part of a guest lecture to Masters students taking the Sexual Health module at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

As in other aspects of young people's lives, concepts of linearity have been utilised to classify sequences of practices - or 'sexual trajectories' - with a 'linear' sequence typically described as progressing from kissing to hand-genital contact to vaginal intercourse. Ideas about sexual sequence are also present in young people's own discourse, with the language of 'bases' being a common way of talking about early sexual activity.



Drawing on data from an ESRC-funded qualitative longitudinal study, we examine what young people perceive to be a 'normal' sequence of sexual practices amongst their age group, and how they account for their own, often more diverse, repertoires and sequences of sexual practices. This paper, therefore, complements a broader discussion about 'ordinariness' by contributing empirical data which challenges current discourses of 'normality' in relation to young people's sexual development.

Our findings have been covered in national and international media and have reached the public. Members of the public have contacted us directly to us to discuss our work, and have provided commentary on the work via BBC radio 4 and on numerous internet sites. This has particularly been the case for our work on coercive sexual activity. Work from this project has led to invitation to sit on an expert panel to inform government strategies to limit children's access to online pornography and is likely to influence the eventual policy in this area. Senior lawyers are interested in the work on coercion and conversations about this are ongoing.

maltreatment.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>997B1C3C-9734-4474-B319-EB7C00F9ABCF</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp;
