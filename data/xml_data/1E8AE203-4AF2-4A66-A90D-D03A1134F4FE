city</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/I026146/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Transforming Lives: young people, art and the city. An interactive, audio-visual immersive installation that investigates and celebrates how young people transform their worlds through the arts. The Follow-On research asks two questions:\n\n* If we were to create a live audio-visual and interactive exhibition drawing on multidisciplinary debates to illustrate and investigate how young people transform their worlds through the arts, what would it look, feel and sound like?\n* how can we stimulate and enrich knowledge exchange about the relationship between art and civil society within the context of the emerging Olympic cultural dialogue between London and Rio de Janeiro?\n\nThe aim of the research is to enable young people to archive and to represent the ways in which they transform their lives and their cities through the art they make. Transforming Lives seeks to link the values of young people's transformational artistic practices with the ideals of the Olympic movement and thereby connect Beyond Text to Olympic themes of cultural dialogue, sustainability, unlimited possibilities for disabled people and the 'Olympic Truce'. The research brings together young people making art with ideas about how art transforms lives, and finds innovative ways to express what can be made from that encounter. Art work by young people is too often lost and unrecognised for its achievements in bringing about real change in people's lives. \n\nThis original interactive installation is produced and curated by young people who have documented their own work and the work of other young people. It will re-present the experiences and histories of young people in Britain and Brazil, creating a platform for debate and celebration. The interactive technologies developed during the research enable new material to be collected from the general public who visit the installation in each location so that Transforming Lives is shaped and curated in different ways as it travels. The installation will be seen in Gateshead, Salisbury and London in 2011 before travelling back to Rio de Janeiro where it was first developed in January 2012. At each location there will be a seminar for senior representatives from agencies that work with young people in the city, each time with a focus related to one of the key themes from the Cultural Olympics.\n\nThere will be a final seminar in London for cultural policy makers, representatives from foundations which focus on arts and social justice, and senior directors of arts organisations that work with young people. \n\nPartners:\nThis Follow-On project is a collaboration between People's Palace Projects [a practice-based arts research centre at Queen Mary, University of London], Lawnmowers Theatre Company [a national organisation for people with Learning Difficulties based in Gateshead], and Salisbury International Arts Festival. \n\nSpectaculu [a graphic/scenic design school for young people from peripheral communities in Rio de Janeiro] is a collaborator on the original Transforming Lives project and will host and support the return of the project to Rio in 2012 [financial support not required as part of this Follow-On application]. Their support and commitment, demonstrated in their Letter of Support, is essential to the impact of the project and the success of the cultural exchange, but they will not be committing resources to the UK work outlined in this Follow-On application.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Heritage[PI] and People's Palace Projects [Project Partner] are in an excellent position to ensure diverse and effective pathways to impact for this research.\n* Impact on individuals and communities: the first phase of this research has demonstrated that the audio-visual immersive environment of TRANSFORMING LIVES has a powerful effect on those who experience and interact with it in each location. It has a strong impact on the communities where it is installed as it reproduces and represents each site through its installation, with young people documenting and archiving images, sounds and histories from the community that are in turn incorporated into the exhibition. Each location is chosen because it has specific meanings that will enhance the impact of the installation on those who are invited to create and to visit. It has a direct impact on social and cultural lives. \n* Impact on young people: through their active participation in the creation of the installation, young people from peripheral communities in UK/Brazil will acquire new skills and understanding relevant to future employment and/or their own artistic development. The experience and practice of this project is focused on articulating and enhancing the creative output of those who are often excluded from mainstream arts platforms and thus enriching civil society. \n* Impact on those who work with young people: the regional seminars run by the project partners [People's Palace Projects/Spectaculu/Lawnmowers/Salisbury Festival/Somerset House], TRANSFORMING LIVES will explore new possibilities and perspectives through the seminars organised with each installation for arts organisations and agencies that work with young people. The understandings and knowledge exchange at the heart of this project will help to increase the effectiveness of policy and practice with young people, and the proposed follow-on activities are structured to achieve multi-agency impact through the involvement of senior representatives from health, education, public security, and social services at each regional seminar. \n* Impact on Government and Non-Government agencies and Foundations: the final seminar in London will focus specifically on drawing a range of policy makers together to look at the learning exchange of the research and discuss implications for policy and practice. Heritage[P1] will write a brief report which will be distributed by People's Palace Projects through its usual networks [academic and non-academic].\n* Impact on UK/Brazil cultural relations: The Department of Culture, Media and Sport has recently reinstated its intention to reinforce the UK's international reputation for artistic excellence, and has specifically requested the support of the Arts Council England in building artistic engagement with Brazil, through close partnership work with Government, the British Council and UKTI.\n[see http://www.culture.gov.uk/images/publications/Forgan_ACE.pdf]. Heritage[PI] has an active role in the process of forging these partnerships in his current work with DCMS, Arts Council, British Council, Brazilian Ministry of Culture and FUNARTE [Brazilian Arts Council]. He will therefore be able to ensure an wide impact for this proposed research by disseminating its outputs across an existing network of partners in the field of cultural policy as well as a growing number of UK arts organisations with a strong interest in establishing links with Brazil. In addition, Heritage has recently begun working with the coordinating team for Rio2016 in the Brazilian Ministry of Sport, to build a coherent and shared cultural strategy with London2012. The outputs from the follow-on activities of TRANSFORMING LIVES will focus directly on the themes and values of both cities as they seek ways to create these connections, ensuring a potential impact for the research that goes well beyond a</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-02-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-02-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>24442</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A new installation created by members of this theatre company run for and by people with learning disabilities</gtr:description><gtr:id>979BE5CE-1553-4E8E-9428-444EDB33F6A0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Mentored and facilitated by Paul Heritage (academic), Sylvan Baker (academic) and Gary Stewart (contemporary artist), artists with learning disabilities were enabled to engage in public debate exploring themes of visibility and the right to cultural expression.

Follow-On Funding and a small contribution from QMUL enabled further work on the themes of displacement and asylum (September 2012, 198 Contemporary Arts and Learning); citizenship and democracy (St. Paul's Way Trust School, June 2013); and gender, human rights, disability and criminal behaviour (The Arbour, installation December 2013, Rich Mix and again in August 2014, London City Hall as part of a final conference on young people and cultural expression.)</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c99f9c1a2178.84939907</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.encountersbeyondtext.com/installation-by-groups-5-6-7-8/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2010,2011,2012,2013,2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Encounters Debate</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3A5A6837-7331-47C2-A648-6D1F5E7C4D47</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A platform discussion held with the lead artist Gary Stewart, PI Paul Heritage and members of the groups who have performed the installation during the project. Opening up possibilities for how we might develop this audio-visual platform and our methodologies in future encounters. The debate highlighted the project's successes, but also the realities of empowering young people to think critically and take responsibility for interrogating the relationship between research, policy and young people.

After the sharing, policymakers present (Arts Council England and GLA) reported the power of hearing young people talk about the work they had engaged in. Arts Council England had already agreed to incorporate future developments of the project as part of People's Palace Projects' core work in the National Portfolio from 2012-2015. When the research team reviewed the project, we concluded thatworking with a local group of young people and bringing them into the University campus had impacts for widening participation, beyond those we had looked for through the research, and we therefore took the decision to focus two future iterations of the project with school pupils and young people in the immediate locality of Tower Hamlets.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-4510256167.9764240c12c36c</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.encountersbeyondtext.com</gtr:url><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>S?o Paulo workshops</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>58E312A5-6968-4C4C-963A-29C199CB3842</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Eight research groups from four S&amp;atilde;o Paulo arts organisations (Bolha de Sab&amp;atilde;o, Cooperifa, Ninho Sansacroma, Teatro Oficina) participated in this phase of the project.

The performances were presented to an audience of apx. 80 people at City Hall, in a partnership with GLA Education &amp;amp; Outreach team, as part of an evening's presentation and policy discussion about the value of youth services and youth arts provision.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>6541D314-3255-4B89-A9F9-414EADC2E8C2</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56cc4fdcda97c4.73051862</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1.
