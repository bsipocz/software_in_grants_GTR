A key example is the extraordinary ability of organisms to make molecules with high specificity (pure, potentially complex molecules are obtained) and efficiency (little energy is used). Nature uses enzymes, proteins that act as catalysts, to achieve this. These enzymes typically work under mild conditions. Enzymes are already used in industry to make molecules that we require in cost-efficient, comparatively green and sustainable processes. However, nature has not provided us with an enzyme to suit the production of every desired molecule; typically enzymes only catalyze specific chemical reactions with specific starting materials. But the process of evolution teaches us that enzymes may be malleable for engineering different properties. For example, making small changes (mutations) in specific amino acids (the building blocks of proteins) of enzymes can allow these enzymes to accept different substrates and thereby catalyze the formation of new, desired molecules. Even though it is possible to determine the positions of atoms in an enzyme with great detail (e.g. using X-ray crystallography), the full effects of making changes to amino acids are not evident. This limits researchers in assessing what the (beneficial or non-beneficial) effects of such mutations are. It is possible to predict these effects with sophisticated computer simulation methods, but performing the necessary simulations requires expert knowledge. The researchers that are involved in optimizing enzymes to obtain new catalysts for making desired molecules are therefore usually limited to guessing what the effect of mutations is based on static structures alone. To bridge the gap between such experimental researchers and those that are experts in computer simulation, we aim to make expert simulation methods available through an interface that is familiar to the experimental researchers. Our project will involve the development of simulation protocols that assess the effects of mutations, using state-of-the-art methods that include molecular dynamics simulations and quantum chemistry calculations. The protocols will be designed such that they can be run on standard computers and they will be made accessible through an easy and familiar interface for experimental researchers (without the need for in-depth training in computer simulation). In addition, the protocols will allow high-throughput screening of 100s of mutations on high-performance computer clusters. The end result will be that researchers not skilled in computer simulation can easily assess the potential influence of mutations using their own computers, and that high-throughput screening of enzyme variants can be performed computationally. This can potentially save a lot of time and resources in the process of adapting an enzyme for a desired reaction. In addition, collaboration between researchers with complementary skills will be encouraged. The tools developed will also be beneficial in related fields, for example in designing effective drugs and understanding inheritable diseases.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>To obtain efficient biocatalysts, re-design or 'de novo' design of enzymes is often needed. Computational methods are increasingly employed for this purpose, but general and efficient workflows to assess how mutations affect enzymes are not yet available and accessible to experimentalists. The aim of this project is therefore to provide computational tools to a) run state-of-the-art simulation to assess the influence of mutations by non-experts on standard computers and b) perform computational high-throughput screening of enzyme variants on HPC facilities. The tools will be geared towards enzyme (re)design, but will also be useful more generally for structural and synthetic biology, drug design and health research. The protocols will go significantly beyond what is currently accessible to experimentalists, by assessing effects on the structure, dynamics, electronic properties and catalytic efficiency of enzymes. To ensure a broad uptake of the tools, we will actively develop and engage with the user community.
 
The project will deliver three main outputs:
1) Computationally inexpensive protocols for use on standard computers and HPC facilities. The protocols will use state-of-the-art simulation techniques, in particular molecular dynamics simulation and quantum mechanical / molecular mechanical (QM/MM) calculations, and provide relevant analysis of the simulation data.

2) A core software program that links together simulation setup and driving of software for MM and QM calculations, to seamlessly run the protocols mentioned above. The program will be set up such that interfaces to different external software packages can be written easily. The software will be released under an open-source (GPL) licence.

3) User-friendly plugins to molecular visualization software popular with structural biologists. With the plugins, released as open-source (GPL licence), users can run the core software program and then display the results in the molecular viewer.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will lead to new, easy-to-use and intuitive software designed to suit experimental researchers with no or little expertise in computational modelling and simulation. The software will thus facilitate basic and applied biochemical research by helping experimental scientists better understand and predict the effect of mutations. The software, related protocols and demonstration cases are primarily aimed at those interested in (re)designing enzymes for use as biocatalysts; this is an area of research that is also actively being pursued in industry, due to its ability to enhance the cost-effectiveness and sustainability of synthesis of chemical compounds and production of biofuels, for example. The tools produced are therefore expected to be taken up in industry as well as academia.

In the short term, the proposed project will deliver tools to help increase understanding and successful engineering of enzymes. The same tools will similarly help related biochemical research, such as protein and drug design. Significant efforts will be made to introduce interested experimental researchers to the tools developed, and train them in their use. By giving researchers with primarily experimental expertise access to and explanation of expert simulation methods, the skill-sets of these researchers will be increased. Outreach to experimental researchers will also encourage further cross-disciplinary research and related transfer of knowledge and skills. In addition, the researcher responsible for software development will obtain valuable programming experience that will be useful in his future academic or non-academic career.

In the medium term, the protocols and software that will be developed as part of the project (especially those for computational high-throughput screening of enzyme variants) should significantly reduce the time and resources spent to optimize biocatalysts for particular reactions. This has direct economic and environmental benefits (biocatalysts can be brought to market sooner, with reduced use of chemicals and energy in the development process). Similarly, computational assessment of the effect of mutations may avoid spending on producing and testing protein variants or drug lead compounds that subsequently prove ineffective.

In the long term, the commercial availability of biocatalysts optimized with help of the developed tools can potentially have enormous economic and environmental benefits by allowing the sustainable production of desired molecules, including fine-chemicals, drugs and biofuels. Biocatalysts are already starting to transform our current chemical industry by improvements in the methods, cost-effectiveness, safety, health, and environmental impact of the processes involved, and these impacts will be extended by the availability of additional biocatalysts. In addition, the application of the tools to help with and speed up drug design, for example to develop anti-viral and antibiotic compounds active against species that are currently drug-resistant, has obvious significant benefits for health in addition to the economic benefits. Similarly, the tools should contribute in helping to fulfil the enormous potential of synthetic biology to deliver societal and economic benefits.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-06-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-07-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>146027</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Research Complex at Harwell</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>UK Catalysis Hub</gtr:department><gtr:description>Catalysis Hub</gtr:description><gtr:id>D3564D15-F657-4F80-A3CA-2F2F38E6C831</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Catalysis is a core area of contemporary science posing major fundamental and conceptual challenges, while being at the heart of the chemical industry - an immensely successful and important part of the overall UK economy (generating in excess of &amp;pound;50 billion per annum). UK catalytic science currently has a strong presence, but there is intense competition in both academic and industrial sectors, and a need for UK industrial activity to shift towards new innovative areas posing major challenges for the future. In light of these challenges the UK Catalysis Hub endeavours to become a leading institution, both nationally and internationally, in the field and acts to coordinate, promote and advance the UK catalysis research portfolio. With a strong emphasis on effective use of the world-leading facilities on the RAL campus.

Structure

The project has four mature themes and a fifth theme starting in 2015 , each with a lead investigator as PI - Catalysis by Design (Catlow); Energy (Hardacre); Environment (Hutchings); Chemical Transformations (Davidson) and the new Biocatalysis and Biotransformations (Nick Turner Manchester) - with the design theme based in the Harwell hub.

Each theme is supported by &amp;pound;3 - 3.5M EPSRC funding over 5 years and within each theme there are typically six to eight sub-projects funded initially for 2 years, involving collaborative teams working at a variety of sites throughout the UK. Professor Hutchings acts as director of the whole national programme for the first three year period and chairs the management group, which is supported by a steering group and an industrial advisory panel. We note that engagement with industry is one of the key aims of the catalysis hub project.

 As well as hosting the design theme, the centre within the Research Complex at Harwell (RCaH) will coordinate the programme, be a base for national and international visitors and provide both training and outreach activities.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c7259083f447.45491320-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Modelling and simulation of enzyme mechanisms for applications in biocatalysts via the Catalysis Hub and training of Hub PDRAs.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Modelling and simulation of enzyme mechanisms for applications in biocatalysts via the Catalysis Hub</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>3053639</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Biocatalysis and Biotransformation: A 5th Theme for the National Catalysis Hub</gtr:description><gtr:end>2019-12-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>EP/M013219/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>AAEAA7B4-A9C2-4F3E-B8B1-872E834C5768</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546394f6e44732.48766134</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The computational tools developed for enzyme simulations have been demonstrated to industrial researchers working in biocatalysis and pharmaceuticals, and via the Catalysis Hub.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>B5634810-D693-4189-9215-5E323CE172D1</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56e0b38d606502.52133824</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have developed computational tools to model enzymes (biological catalysts) and the reactions they catalyse. 
Enzymes make possible all chemical reactions required for the survival and reproduction of living systems. The remarkable power of enzymes to catalyse reactions rapidly, selectively and efficiently under mild conditions is exploited in biotechnology. We are, however, not yet taking full advantage of enzymes as biocatalysts, whereas more widespread application of biocatalysts in industry is desired. To enable the use of enzymes as biocatalysts for reactions of interest, modifications are often necessary; for example to improve efficiency or alter and broaden substrate specificity. Recent state-of-the-art examples of such modifications, or re-design, often employ a combination of knowledge-based site-specific engineering and directed evolution. De novo enzyme design, which can be used to obtain biocatalysts for non-natural chemical reactions, has emerged as a promising field in the past decade and typically uses a similar combined strategy. For both re-design and de novo design, computational methods are now increasingly playing a key role in the design strategies employed. Specifically, computational simulation methods can help to predict the influence of amino-acid mutations far beyond the static view of modelling a new side-chain into a crystal structure. Changes in the structure, electrostatics and dynamics of an enzyme that affect substrate binding and catalysis can be simulated. It is increasingly recognized that all these effects, including protein dynamics, must be considered to allow successful enzyme (re)design. 
Beyond the need for (computationally) assessing the effect of mutations in enzyme (re)design, the wider fields of protein and drug design also benefit from such assessment. In synthetic biology, mutations are routinely made with the aim to improve designed functions of proteins other than biocatalysis, such as protein-protein or protein-ligand complex formation. Mutations that occur in rapidly evolving systems such as viruses or bacteria are often a challenge for drug design. Computational simulation can be used to understand why certain mutations or enzyme variants cause antibiotic resistance. For the design of drugs that target such rapidly evolving systems, efficient computational prediction of the influence of mutations on drug interaction will be beneficial. Although computer simulations can, in principle, efficiently assess different effects of mutations on enzymes and other proteins (structural, dynamical and catalytic), setting up and performing such simulations currently requires significant knowledge of and experience with biomolecular simulation methods and a range of different programs. Each of these programs comes with its own requirements for installation, input preparation, usage and analysis of results. The application of combined quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods to the study of biological systems is a thriving and growing area, with advances in computer hardware and software opening up exciting new avenues of research. The award of the 2013 Nobel Prize for Chemistry to Martin Karplus, Michael Levitt and Arieh Warshel, recognises the development of combined quantum mechanical / molecular mechanical (QM/MM) methods and the important role these methods can play in our understanding of enzyme-catalysed reactions.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The computational tools developed will be useful for researchers in academia and industry working on enzymes, e.g. for biocatalysis. All software will be released using an open source, GPL license, and will be hosted on the github site. Final code will also be accessible via a Google Code repository, and made available through CCPForge (ccpforge.cse.rl.ac.uk). Google code and github are publicly accessible repositories, which can provide immediate, free access to the software while it is in the process of development. In addition, packaged releases of the software will be produced and hosted through CCPForge as well as data.bris (see above) to ensure its integrity, availability and longevity. Github and google code provide indefinite hosting and archiving of the data, together with versioning and automatic metadata generation. This will enable the software to be advertised to automatic software discovery services, linked to from third party sites and the code to be re-used by interested parties. To ensure further visibility to the user community, links to the core program and its plugins to visualization programs will be provided on the CCP-BioSim website (ccpbiosim.ac.uk) and further download links for the plugins will be placed on their respective websites. In addition, documentation and installation instructions for the PyMOL plugin will also be placed on its designated wiki site (http://pymolwiki.org/index.php/Category:Plugins). Detailed descriptions and the required input files for the developed simulation protocols (for all supported simulation software packages) will be made publicly available via a dedicated github site (https://github.com/marcvanderkamp/enzlig_tools) and (when finalised) through data.bris (Bristol's Research Data Repository). The latter allows free, secure and accessible storage (including unique Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs)) for reasonable size data sets; simulation protocols and input will require minimal storage ~1 GB. To make the protocols easily accessible, DOIs will be generated and links placed on the CCP-BioSim website (http://www.ccpbiosim.ac.uk).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5D71CB69-3976-437A-BAFD-FF4FE1B6053E</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e0b7779c1445.83525254</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Education,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://sites.google.com/site/mulhollandresearchgroup/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>Protocols and tools to run (automated) atomistic simulations of protein-ligand (e.g. enzyme-substrate) systems.
