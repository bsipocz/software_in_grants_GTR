and clothing.
In 2008 we developed and introduced a revolutionary ballet pointe shoe using a new polymer
(d30) and production processes to update a traditional product which had not changed since
the 17th century. The new shoe is more comfortable, reduces stress injuries and last many
times longer (top dancers only get 40 minutes out of a pair of traditional pointe shoes). Within
the dance industry our pointe shoes are widely known and are used by dancers in the Royal
Ballet, English National Ballet, New York City Ballet, American Ballet Theatre, Cuban
National Ballet, Paris Opera
Innovation is key to our business development strategy. Our pointe shoe has raised
considerable interest worldwide and has resulted in our shoes being featured on Sky and in the
national &amp;amp; international press and our shoes are currently featured in an exhibition about
innovation at Chicago Museum.
As part of our innovation strategy we have spent considerable time investigating how we can
significantly reduce the material, labour and overall manufacturing costs of our shoes, so that
we can manufacture in-house in the UK rather than in China or India.
We have identified an innovative approach to design &amp;amp; manufacturing which will enable us to
manufacture our shoes in the UK at 55% less than China , which would allow us to compete
globally &amp;amp; significantly increase our market share and profit margins. The process is also
suitable for the manufacture of other types of footwear.
This project will develop a sustainable shoe which combines the sole and upper into a single
component, recreating a surface texture of synthetic leather, using an innovative footwear
manufacturing &amp;amp; injection moulding process. The manufacturing process will eliminate the
assembly, gluing, and stitching processes and their associated costs thereby significantly
reducing the manufacturing costs, enabling Europe to compete with global competitors. The
technology also has other applications outside the footwear industry.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>74760</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">710068</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
