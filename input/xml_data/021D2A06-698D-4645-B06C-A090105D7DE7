Although there have been a number of initiatives to develop and test Internet of Things scenarios there has been a patchy implementation. Manchester City Council through MDDA has recently, through various development programmes created a MESH and environmental sensor network for the Oxford Road Corridor - A main thoroughfare into the city centre that transits Manchester University, MMU, cultural institutions and a mixture of other public and private spaces. The backbone to the network is a publicly owned fast fibre network and access to this network and the various institutions that connect with it will help drive the scenario study.
The choice of the urban built environment and civic infrastructure as the project?s convergence scenario is significant through the experience of working with public bodies on the development of open data policies and the Greater Manchester Datastore; the existing public realm data infrastructure; and the ability of the consortium to work with diverse stakeholder communities.
To tackle these problems, we have assembled a team of experts in all key aspects of the problem. Drawing on their experience, networks and knowledge of their specialist domains, we will assemble a comprehensive view of the issues around the Internet Of Things value chain. A key task for our project is to combine these aspects into an integrated end-to-end view, that will enable the necessary harmonization and hence maximise the potential of our convergence scenario.
Initially the project will seek to create a baseline of stakeholder understanding of the Internet of Things in relation to the convergence scenario. This will be undertaken through workshops and co-designed events such as the FutureEverything Smart City SDK project, NWeGG public sector forum and Manchester Corridor engagement programme. It has been identified through previous work with public sector and businesses that different stakeholder communities have different needs and the workshop programme will be tuned to this.
In parallel to the mapping and baseline activity with stakeholders, we will undertake an appraisal of Internet of Things related technologies that are existing, in development or perceived to be relevant Manchester. This will take into account the data infrastructure being developed by the City through European and UK based funding programmes as well as ubiquitous commercially available mobile data infrastructure. The programme will assess the capabilities and limitations of already existing technology, data structures and protocols.
Identification of personal identity, control of data and licensing issues will take place not only to understand ethical and data protection issues but that of the monitored environment?s perceived relationship with surveillance.
The consortium understands that many ?smart? technologies can be perceived as a threat to established practices. In this convergence scenario the understanding of these issues will be key to enabling implementation.
A needs based analysis of public bodies and other stakeholders will be undertaken within the workshop programme and these will be mapped onto the capabilities of the existing infrastructure. This analysis will give an indication as to the barriers, both real and perceived that the sustainable implementation of Internet of Things faces.
The mapping of perception, need, awareness and concerns of stakeholders with the assessment of the available and soon to be made available infrastructure, technology and platforms will be used to identify the use cases, gaps, enablers and business models that will enable a robust testing of the urban built environment/civic infrastructure scenario.
The rich portfolio of dissemination routes listed in Question 1.4 will ensure that the outputs of our study reach people that can make use of them.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>49980</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">130753</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
