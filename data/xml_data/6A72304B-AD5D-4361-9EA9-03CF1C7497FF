&lt;p>Research into people's engagement with online discussion forums is in its infancy, and advancing this research is the focus of the grant. The authors' past research suggests that even when people approach online forums primarily to seek information (eg, advice about illness management), they may become more engaged both with other users, and with the forum's cause/purpose. Simply put, these users come to feel that their lives have been transformed. This transformation can lead to marked changes in how users view themselves (their self-concept). These changes are known to have positive repercussions for individual well-being in offline settings; this research will investigate whether this relationship is equally robust in online environments. It will also investigate whether such changes translate into offline impact (eg, users may show support for the forum's cause via social/political activism). &lt;/p>

SWF is the regional voice for voluntary and community-focused organisations. It supports them by informing them of the latest policy developments; connecting them with other groups, public bodies and businesses and influencing government and other key decision-makers about their needs and concerns. As the SWF member organisations rely on mobilizing supporters, lobbying and fundraising, then understanding how to connect and inspire through social networking tools is vital. Our talk was produced in partnership with our moderators. In addition to the conference talk and Q&amp;amp;A session, we provided a surgery session to attendees to offer more bespoke advice to end-users. Participant organisations included Patients Association, Devon Rape Crisis Service, Bristol Rape Crisis, NHS Dorset, Exeter CVS, Headway Devon, Somerset Community Foundation, Educational Action Challenging Homophobia, Somerset Advice Network, East Devon CAB. Feedback on the conference was overwhelmingly positive. 



Our 30-minute talk has recently been uploaded onto YouTube

This is one of two YouTube videos produced. The second is recorded as a separate engagement activitiy

After my talk, we received feedback that the organisations represented in the audience had really engaged in a positive way with the content (both at the time and via feedback received following the day). This was followed up by in-person and email exchanges, especially for attendees from voluntary organisations linked to mental health/well-being (e.g., Rape Crisis, Headway). This bias in interest was, we suspect, due to our findings underscoring the positive benefits that can accrue from online forum involvement.

In addition, after the talk was posted on You Tube, we received approaches from organisation (e.g., Shelter Cymru) seeking advice about setting up forums for members to discuss issues and support one another demonstrating the impact our research has had upon practice.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-6536797533.3116922b451288</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sjpx4YmdkM</gtr:url><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Contribution to Radio Devon broadcast on Social Networking</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C468EAB4-87F1-44E9-BF90-7845D93EE14C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was a radio interview attended by Jessica Salvatore (and another person scheduled to speak at the South West Forum conference) to promote the conference and also to outline the main findings of our research in a very concrete and brief way.

Abstract



Past research has been surprisingly mixed in its conclusions about the relationship between group identification and group norm following. Equally, it has left unaddressed a key issue: how does this relationship change and evolve over the course of group membership? The present research used online discussion forums to monitor the evolution of such relationships. Participants comprised one hundred ninety-eight forum users who responded to an online questionnaire invitation posted on the forum. The questionnaire assessed length of their engagement on the forum; levels of identification with the forum group; and tendency to engage in normative behaviour. Higher levels of social identification strongly predicted both enthusiasm about and adherence to group norms. These relationships strengthened, rather than dissipated, with increased density of forum use. We discuss the implications of these findings for theories of social influence and social capital; online sociability and well being; and change in the self across time.

This talk alerted academics to some of the practical aspects of group identity (here, in terms of how it was linked in a positive sense to well-being and to offline involvement). It was clear that the audience (as is often the case) do not always readily apply the theoretical aspects to practical applications. What was also noteworthy is that the audience were reminded of the role traditional forums can still play, and how, in the rush to embrace newer forms of social media (Facebook, Twitter), we ought not to overlook the merits of these older formats.

After my talk, several academics requested copies of our draft manuscript.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-6018066542.2399222b180888</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academic audiences (collaborators, peers etc.)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://abstracts.bps.org.uk/index.cfm?&amp;ResultsType=Abstracts&amp;ResultSet_ID=7187&amp;FormDisplayMode=view&amp;frmShowSelected=true&amp;localAction=details</gtr:url><gtr:year>2011</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Understanding and harnessing the power of online communities</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9A694FF1-3B3B-4489-B7D1-422840DCC92C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In addition to the seminar presented at the one day conference as part of the South West Forum's (SWF) programme of events (reported as separate outcome) we also filmed a shorter, 'Talking Heads' video in which Louise Pendry and Jessica Salvatore summarised the rationale, research and main findings more concisely. The purpose of this shorter version was to promote a wider dissemination of our main findings.
