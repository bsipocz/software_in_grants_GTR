In short, through an analysis of quantitative data about differing patterns of stable values in European societies and an exploration of the links between these values and welfare state strategies they aim to bring the 'cultural dimension back in' to comparisons of welfare states.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research has the potential to impact on practical policy-making, public service design and wider public debates in a longer term not only within the UK but elsewhere, although it is difficult to plan or predict any direct long-term user-engagement at this level in a short macro-quantitative research project.

Earlier examinations of the effect of the cultural context on welfare politics have suggested that the value-characteristics of each society are important factors for public support for policies. That is, the legitimacy of a policy, a key determinant of its ultimate fate, is in part dependent upon the cultural context of each society. It might be suggested, therefore, that policies and public services should be informed by the value-characteristics of their own society and furthermore, of target groups, in order to be more effective (through having wider public support, and more importantly, having higher user- or take-up rates amongst targeted or entitled beneficiaries) or that failure to address the cultural underpinnings of policy over the long term may erode political support for welfare (e.g. see Taylor-Gooby, 2008a; Taylor-Gooby, 2008b: 8; Taylor-Gooby &amp;amp; Wallace, 2009). Though addressing such issues indirectly, some policy makers and policy influencers will find our analysis of the links between societal values and social policies of interest to their own agendas. The wider public may also be interested in these issues too and there is potential for the research to contribute to popular media debates that address questions about 'British values' and how particular public services fit with these values. Clearly there is a need to approach such debates with sensitivity and we stress here that such debates are one remove from the concerns of our project, but they demonstrate nonetheless the potential broader public debate that the research could feed into. 

In methodological terms, the multi-dimensional approach for comparing welfare policies using fuzzy-set ideal type analysis also has the potential to appeal to non-academic policy research communities as well as the academic research community. Cross-national comparative policy evaluation has not always been satisfactory when conducted on the basis of single-dimensional linear measures. (For instance, as part of the Bologna process in European higher education there has been considerable debate amongst stakeholders about the need for 'multi-dimensional transparency tools' that move beyond simple league tables that rank all institutions in the same manner). Contributing to debates about the value and potential of multi-dimensional models and methods will help further awareness of the possibilities of these methods for both theoretical and applied policy work. 

Finally, while we expect to create only a relatively short space for us to communicate directly with a wider policy-related audience within the short time frame (16 months) of the proposed research, we will attempt to communicate the relevant findings of our work with political think tanks mainly by creating short reports that might fit into their work and through short, non-technical, postings on our project website.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>77789</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>500</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>Unknown</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Policy Roundtable Fund</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-12-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Social Policy Association (SPA)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>63236817-A3A2-47CE-99CD-2E8E37005341</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c988dfa2ee37.11437069</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-12-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>10000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>Unknown</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Winning Support for the Safety Net: Historical Review</gtr:description><gtr:end>2015-07-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Shelter</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>14ABE88A-02F8-46A0-B7C7-640FB7072481</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56ddc88cd14157.86468910</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-12-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>2500</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>University of York ESRC Impact Accelerator Account Responsive Award</gtr:description><gtr:end>2015-12-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Economic and Social Research Council</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>EC96CF32-0C09-40A9-A3C2-067FA28176CB</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56ddc9d6dceec5.58693779</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-08-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>This original proposal for this project underlined the abstract nature of the research and suggested societal impacts would likely flow only in the medium and long term once our scientific findings were in the public domain and had permeated into related debates. We are pleased to report that these impacts have begun to emerge.

Since December 2014, the project's PI (John Hudson) has been working with a number of social policy campaigning organisations in the UK on a strand of work that flows from this project's conceptualisation of the difference between (a) culture, (b) societal values and (c) public attitudes. In 2014 and 2015 he worked with Shelter on a project (funded by Shelter) exploring how societal values and public attitudes to welfare have altered in the UK since the 1940s. The main conceptual framework from the ESRC funded 'The impact of culture on welfare politics and welfare state types' project provided the central analytic breakthrough for the work with Shelter, allowing a novel, empirically rooted, interpretation of how public support for the welfare state has (or has not) altered since the Beveridge reforms of the 1940s. 

This work with Shelter has been presented at several non-academic events that have been attended by a wide range of campaigning organisations and think tanks, including: (i) an invite only workshop organised by Shelter, Oxfam and the Webb Memorial Trust (London, January 2016) at which anti-poverty campaigning organisations explored strategies for communicating their messages to the public and policy makers; (ii) a workshop organised jointly by Shelter and the University of York (London, October 2015), funded by a University of York ESRC Impact Accelerator Account award attend by specialists in attitudes to social policy research from academic, campaigning and think tank organisations; (iii) the Locality Convention (Liverpool, November 2015), presenting to a cross-section of attendees from this large (500+ people) conference which brings together community sector groups. 

A report from this follow on work was provided to Shelter in 2016; two academic papers followed in 2016 also, which in turn lead to a Policy Roundtable event on 'Exploring 'welfare' attitudes and experiences' held at the House of Lords in December 2016. The PI (John Hudson) co-organised with Ruth Patrick (University of Liverpool) and Emma Wincup (University of Leeds). The event was partially funded by the UK Social Policy Association (SPA) and organised in conjunction with the Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG). CPAG took the lead in organising attendees - the event was invite only - and there was particularly strong representation from the third sector and think tanks, including Britain Thinks, the Children's Society, the Equality Trust, Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the Living Wage Foundation, Shelter, the Westminster Policy Institute, as well as people working in Parliament, central and local government, and the media.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>2615CE8D-742A-463E-8298-1DDD2F1CB73F</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54634ba17d2f23.02867093</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Our project aimed to explore big picture questions such as:

* Does (national) 'culture matter' in explaining cross-national differences in welfare state provision?
* Do different countries have different societal values that might act as a proxy for differences in culture? 
* Can we measure such differences empirically? 
* Do these differences help explain why different policy choices are being made in different countries? 

Four broad findings emerged from our analysis.

The first was that our previously developed method for eliciting societal values proved to be robust when extended and updated with the addition of the latest (fourth) wave of European Values Study (EVS) and World Values Survey (WVS) data to our pooled data set. Given that our method is based on the identification of broadly stable patterns of societal values the addition of data from this fourth wave provided a key test of the veracity of earlier work. The addition of an extra wave of data from each survey did not undermine the core findings produced in earlier research and there was a good degree of crossover in terms of the examples of societal values extracted whether using three or four waves of data. 

Secondly, and following from the above, we extracted six examples of societal values that overlapped heavily with those found in our earlier work, but with some refinements and two additional values around political participation identified. We labelled the eight examples of societal values we identified as: religiosity; conservative social norms; permissive values on adherence to laws; optimistic values; traditional family values; inter-personal tolerance; political activeness; and, political orientedness.

Thirdly, and perhaps most fundamentally, we found strong empirical support for the 'culture matters' thesis when using proxies for policy decisions (levels of spending, policy structures) as dependent variables and, along with data on the economic, political and institutional context, our examples of societal values as independent variables in regression models. Inclusion of the cultural context improved the explanatory power of our models in a meaningful way.

Fourthly, in looking to add a cultural component to models of welfare state ideal types we found there was no clear and easy way to integrate our examples of societal values into existing ideal types in a meaningful way. Indeed, we concluded that the suggestion we would do so in our original proposal was based on flawed thinking that societal values would in some way neatly overlay with welfare state ideal types and might be usefully subsumed within them. Instead we found quite complex patterns of societal values that often operated very independently from welfare state types. Not only did this provide still stronger evidence for the culture matters thesis, but raised intriguing questions about how welfare states and societal values interact. We found that experimental multi-step fuzzy set methods provided a useful tool for exploring these interactions. For instance, while the strength of traditional family values seemed unimportant in explaining policy interventions in social democratic regimes they were much more significant in liberal regimes.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>For academic audiences, our findings have been disseminated in our monograph 'Culture and the Politics of Welfare' and in conference presentations of this work. Its core argument is culture deserves a more central focus in welfare regime debates, but it also offers some methodological advances and suggestions for future study. Additional activity will follow in the future and, in particular, we aim to use the research as a springboard into debates on the barriers to cross-national policy learning (a paper has already been presented on this) and about the role of changing societal values in fostering social policy change (the monograph points to some key cases here).

Non-academic audiences will have an interest in both of these new areas. It is recognized that policies cannot be easily transferred between countries with very different contexts and our work may help develop methods to match countries that are similar enough to allow for movement of policy ideas. This aspect of the work will likely appeal to organisations engaged in comparative policy evaluations designed to select examples of international best practice. By contrast, it is campaigning organisations that are likely to be most interested in the work on how shifting societal values may foster social policy change: political parties, pressure groups and think tanks may find this dimension of our work of use. The PI has been taking forward key aspects of the work from the angle as part of the project's long-term Pathways to Impact strategy.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>32B67349-EFF8-4F8E-8DDD-F972684B51D8</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54624fbe4eef29.10619630</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.palgrave.com/gb/book/9781137457486</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>289BDA2D-D19B-48F7-8FED-4E8645689653</gtr:id><gtr:title>Unemployment spending correlates. figshare.</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/99c5c354a72a22053d6cbb9f24a99c2a"><gtr:id>99c5c354a72a22053d6cbb9f24a99c2a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hudson, J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56ddc0bf0817b8.79551254</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0574E8C1-0CC0-42B8-9E02-7BBB226636A2</gtr:id><gtr:title>Exploring Public Attitudes to Welfare over the Longue Dur&amp;eacute;e: Re-examination of Survey Evidence from Beveridge, Beatlemania, Blair and Beyond</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Social Policy &amp; Administration</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/3820911f0fc800698f0fb6c0d2d44a71"><gtr:id>3820911f0fc800698f0fb6c0d2d44a71</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hudson J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c94080dda3a7.38662117</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5AA3C0C0-4942-4CDB-86E2-587039E53B12</gtr:id><gtr:title>Nostalgia narratives?
