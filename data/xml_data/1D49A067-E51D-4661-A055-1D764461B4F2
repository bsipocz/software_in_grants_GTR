They have well-documented and specific memory difficulties, yet scarcely any research has examined how they fare as eyewitnesses.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The present research project investigates eyewitness testimony in ASD. The first phase investigates how well witnesses with ASD recall an event in which they played an active role, and specifically how well they recall actions that they performed themselves versus actions that they passively observed another person perform. Whilst typical individuals tend use their self-involvement at encoding to boost their memory retrieval to recall more actions that they performed themselves than actions performed by another person, there is some evidence to suggest that people with ASD may not show this facilitative effect of self on memory.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The second part of the project explores the effectiveness of an alternative interviewing technique for witness with ASD. Previous research indicates that the widely used ?Cognitive Interview? is unsuitable for them, however a new technique called the ?Self-Administered Interview? may be more suitable because it is non-social in nature and affords the witness more control over the pace of the interview. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-04-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>83916</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Memory and vulnerable witnesses workshop - Serious Organised Crime Agency</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EF59E8F5-2DC1-412B-A478-ACA3A47443DF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Lecture/training session provided to the Serious Organised Crime Agency's Professional Training and Development Seminar.

Providing Criminal Justice System professionals with a better understanding of autism and the challenges faced when someone with autism comes into contact with the Criminal Justice System. Not only does this knowledge enhance the ways in which such professionals deal with individuals with autism, it also improves the experiences that individuals with autism have in the Criminal Justice System, and potentially increases their access to justice.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545e196a6d18b2.71671744</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>279555</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>ESRC Future Research Leaders</gtr:description><gtr:end>2018-10-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Economic and Social Research Council</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>ES/N001095/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>C5ACF5BF-24B5-440F-849F-64AB32D32B3A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d487ea525428.94410157</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-04-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>16160</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Autism and the Criminal Justice System network</gtr:description><gtr:end>2014-12-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>British Psychological Society (BPS)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>F93DC62F-AB8F-46D7-BF31-BB8401351B21</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5ee646c05ee646de</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Learned Society</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-09-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Academic papers
? &amp;quot;Recall of a live and personally experienced eyewitness event by adults with autism spectrum disorder&amp;quot;: The first study from the project has been published in Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders (Maras, Memon, Lambrechts &amp;amp; Bowler, 2013).
? &amp;quot;Eyewitness Testimony in Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Review&amp;quot;: The review paper was accepted in the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders (Maras &amp;amp; Bowler, 2014). 
? &amp;quot;Evaluating the effectiveness of the Self-Administered Interview for Witnesses with Autism Spectrum Disorder&amp;quot;: This study is now published in Applied Cognitive Psychology (Maras, Mulcahy, Memon, Picariello &amp;amp; Bowler, 2014). 
? The study examining the credibility of witnesses with ASD is currently in being extended to include further data on stereotypes and will be submitted for publication early 2015.

Academic conference presentations 
Findings from this project were presented at four international conferences: 
&amp;quot;Recall of a live and personally experienced eyewitness event by adults with autism spectrum disorder&amp;quot; was presented at the: American Psychology-Law Society Annual conference (Portland, Oregon, March 2013), International Meeting for Autism Research (San Sebastian, Spain, May 2013) and the Society for Applied Research in Memory and Cognition (Rotterdam, The Netherlands, June 2013). 
&amp;quot;Evaluating the effectiveness of the Self-Administered Interview for Witnesses with Autism Spectrum Disorder&amp;quot; was presented at the International Investigative Interviewing Research Group conference (Maastricht, July 2013). All were oral presentations.

Non-academic impact 
? &amp;quot;Memory and vulnerable witnesses workshop - Serious Organised Crime Agency&amp;quot;: During the Fellowship I was invited by SOCA (now National Crime Agency) to deliver this workshop session for Criminal Justice System (CJS) professionals. 
? I was also asked to contribute to the Advocates Gateway Toolkit 3: Autism (http://www.theadvocatesgateway.org/images/toolkits/3AUTISM211013.pdf), providing advocates with information about the difficulties people with ASD might have within the CJS. The review paper written as part of the fellowship activities (Maras &amp;amp; Bowler, 2014) is one of the main bibliographic sources for advocates to refer to.
? &amp;quot;Autism and the Criminal Justice System&amp;quot;: I organised this one-day conference at City University London, on 12 June 2012, with eight guest speakers, from intermediaries, clinicians, academics and a barrister (see http://bit.ly/asd-criminal-justice). It was attended by over 120 attendees from a range of backgrounds including academics, policy makers, the police, lawyers and clinicians. I also organised a similar conference in Manchester in September 2013 as part of a BPS grant (see below).
? &amp;quot;Autism and the Criminal Justice System network&amp;quot;: During the Fellowship an application was made for a British Psychological Society Public Engagement Grant for this network to facilitate communication between academics, clinicians, intermediaries, police, lawyers, the judiciary, policy makers and individuals with ASD. &amp;pound;16,160 awarded to run the network. The two-year project is currently half way through, and has already run a one-day conference and policy maker workshop, where policy changes and revisions of existing interviewing guidelines were discussed. An ASD and CJS project website including the most recent findings disseminated in scientific and lay terms is currently being populated (http://www.autismandcjs.org.uk/) and has already had over 4,500 hits.

In sum, findings have been disseminated and used by a range of academic and non-academic professionals, including the police and registered intermediaries.</gtr:description><gtr:id>DD826AC3-F986-4945-A5BE-22A12900840B</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>545e1e0209f1b3.07646641</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This Postdoctoral Fellowship developed further my PhD work investigating eyewitness testimony in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The main aim of the project was to investigate how well ASD witnesses recall a live and personally experienced event, and specifically their recall for actions that they performed themselves versus those performed by another person. This is particularly important because witnesses can play both passive (bystaner) or active (victim) roles in events and the level of involvement can influence memory. Our findings suggested that witnesses with ASD did, in fact, recall more details of a live event when they carried out actions themselves. However they were also more likely to confuse the source of who performed which actions unless they were given more directed questions in interviews.

Additionally, the project explored the effectiveness of a &amp;quot;self-administered&amp;quot; interviewing technique for witness with ASD. Because such an interview is non-social and affords the witness more control over its pace, it had the potential to be effective for ASD witnesses. However, our findings showed that, concordant with its parent &amp;quot;cognitive interview&amp;quot;, the self-administered version was not effective in its current form for ASD individuals. Together findings indicate that ASD witnesses may need more strategic direction to support their recall than current interviewing models afford. 

Finally, we used videos from the first study to gather credibility data. Irrespective of the actual accuracy of their account, witnesses with ASD are perceived by mock jurors as less credible than witnesses without ASD. However it seems that educating jurors in the disorder improves this somewhat.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>I plan to continue to disseminate findings to non-academic beneficiaries including police, intermediaries and CJS professionals. This will be done through training workshops as in previous years (e.g., National Crime Agency) and via the BPS-funded ASD and CJS Public Engagement grant activities. 

This work provides a platform for future research to build upon. For example, findings have highlighted that context reinstatement does not work for witnesses with ASD in verbal or written form. It is important for future research to further this and provide an interviewing method that is effective in eliciting more details from ASD individuals. I am also presently extending the credibility data to examine the role that stereotypes of ASD play in lay perceptions of their credibility.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5AF7E415-8882-43F3-B4A8-3C7CF38B5610</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545e1d2a48b360.13202356</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Toolkit for the Advocate's Gatetway: WITNESSES AND DEFENDANTS WITH AUTISM: MEMORY AND SENSORY ISSUES (Maras, K. &amp;amp; Crane, L.)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BC44FD62-17FF-49FB-9C75-9907D1A2ED97</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The toolkit provided guidelines for advocates on memory and sensory issues in autism, with implications for how they should be questioned in legal proceedings.

In the first workshop, psychologists, CJS national level portfolio leads, representatives of Government departments and leading charities, by working together, identified challenges including vulnerability, recognition of autism, a lack of theoretically-informed training, pathway challenges (e.g., time constraints) and limited cross-pollination and inter-organisational collaboration. Potential solutions that were identified lay in improving autism awareness, improved screening processes (possibly CJS specific), development of role-specific CJS training, adaptations to criminal proceedings (e.g., based on the individual needs of the witness/defendant) and inter-organisational and inter-profession collaborations. At the second workshop leading academics, CJS professionals, representatives of Government departments, representative from the Advisory Group to the All Party Parliamentary Group for Autism, charity and policy leads discussed existing research evidence that could assist future development of best practice and identified where research gaps currently lay. This focused on different aspects of policing and criminal proceedings, including vulnerability/recognition, interviewing, cross-examination, court constitution and revolving door (e.g., reducing risk of re-offending). 

Resulting impacts from these activities were included:
1. The Government formally acknowledges the contribution of the project in its 2014 Strategy on Autism for Adults in England (an update on its earlier 2010 strategy) that it publishes as a mandatory requirement of the Autism Act 2009.
2. The contribution of project members is acknowledged in the Advocate's Gateway 'Autism Toolkit', an on-line resource for lawyers and judges involved in criminal proceedings, that is published by the Advocacy Training Council for England and Wales. Dr Maras (alongside her collaborator Dr Crane) was invited to produce a new toolkit for the Advocate's Gateway, on memory and sensory issues in autism (expected end 2014). 
3. As a result of the Law Society's participation its representative, a defence solicitor specialising in autism, has joined the team of a parallel initiative, involving a project team member (Sue Mulcahy), a collaborator (policing) and a participant defence solicitor, in the development of a formal proposal for a discrete legislative code of practice for the treatment of suspects with autism.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-2040432218.4998841621f2bc0</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>EC86158C-32CD-4155-9A44-230ACB36AAF7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Recall of a live and personally experienced eyewitness event by adults with autism spectrum disorder.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of autism and developmental disorders</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/432c192e45f53be10085d275168afe39"><gtr:id>432c192e45f53be10085d275168afe39</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Maras KL</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0162-3257</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cfdbfdbefbb7c1</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B7812145-6C6A-48F6-AEAB-6121F649EC47</gtr:id><gtr:title>Mental imagery scanning in autism spectrum disorder</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/aea8a46a92bd01e0268e46569993ad64"><gtr:id>aea8a46a92bd01e0268e46569993ad64</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Maras K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545e1fe833cb57.20871129</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B321E876-D9F3-4DDD-B385-9EAC4EDC61AD</gtr:id><gtr:title>Impact of the Temporal Dynamics of Speech and Gesture on Communication in Autism Spectrum Disorder</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/3573611793274cec00d665213c4e57ec"><gtr:id>3573611793274cec00d665213c4e57ec</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lambrechts A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a955aa453e162.78584604</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>14C36874-FE4C-4E82-B456-780CD60460A4</gtr:id><gtr:title>Evaluating the Effectiveness of the Self-Administered Interview
