CONTEXT
2020 will mark 900 years since the birth of Thomas Becket, 850 years since his murder in Canterbury Cathedral, and 800 years since the 'translation' of his relics. This triple anniversary coincides with 'The Canterbury Journey', a &amp;pound;24.7 million conservation, education and interpretation project at the Cathedral (completion 2021) which will ensure a long-term legacy for resources created. Moreover, a newly-founded Heritage Forum convened by the City Council is now seeking to reinvigorate the city's World Heritage site, and broaden and enhance Canterbury's tourism offer by connecting the much-visited Cathedral more closely to the city's many other outstanding historic sites. 

This Follow-on initiative is driven by:
- new understanding of Becket's medieval cult and present-day visitor needs generated by the 2014-17 AHRC 'Pilgrimage and England's Cathedrals' (PEC) project
- the digital visualisation expertise of the Centre for the Study of Christianity &amp;amp; Culture (Univ. of York)
- collaboration with the British Museum, Canterbury Archaeological Trust, Canterbury Museums &amp;amp; Galleries, Museum of London
- educational needs
- newly emerging heritage/tourism goals. 

Collaboration with PEC partners and wide-ranging consultation with the City Council, business and community groups, heritage, tourism and cultural bodies in Canterbury, have revealed significant new heritage-tourism, educational and community engagement possibilities. The PEC project created detailed digital reconstructions of four key sites inside the cathedral (including Becket's shrine) which are already changing perceptions of pilgrim experience at Canterbury. The Follow-on proposal will create a new digital mode of the whole Cathedral set in the medieval City of Canterbury, thus placing the interior models in a broader geocultural context, including medieval pilgrim routes and key buildings. 

OUTCOMES 
This innovative, interactive Cathedral/City model (amplified by other PEC research data) will have seven main outcomes for key heritage, educational, cultural, business and local community partners:

CONNECTING CATHEDRAL AND CITY 
- Use in the new permanent Cathedral exhibition, revealing the multi-layered relationship between the Cathedral, Becket's shrine, and the city which grew in response to his cult and pilgrim needs. 
- Providing a visual foundation for presenting a more integrated tourism offer for Canterbury, enhancing connections between the Cathedral, the City, and the rich multiplicity of heritage sites. 

CONNECTING BECKET WITH HIS TIME
A new online/Flash Drive education resource (particularly for History, Literature and RE curricula)

SHAPING BECKET 2020 MUSEUM EXHIBITIONS/ACTIVITIES
Collaboration with the British Museum (providing digital assets for a major exhibition), Canterbury Museums and Museum of London

EXPLORING THE BECKET STORY TODAY THROUGH WORD AND IMAGE
Supporting drama, poetry, art and craft workshops, with the Marlowe Theatre and the Canterbury Journey, to stimulate creative contemporary responses to the Becket story from all age-groups and backgrounds

CONNECTING BECKET AND PILGRIMAGE TODAY
Shaping visitor trails and services for 2020, when the Cathedral also hosts the international Lambeth Conference

ENHANCING CANTERBURY-LONDON TOURISM LINKS
Connecting Becket's cult to his influence on London and its landscape for the Becket 2020 website

USING HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES TO INFORM CURRENT MANAGEMENT
Conference for managers of sacred sites, statutory advisors (including Historic England), historians, theologians, social scientists, reviewing current moves to restore shrines and relics to Anglican cathedrals</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The Becket Connection builds on the exceptionally fruitful partnership with Canterbury Cathedral and wider heritage networks formed through the AHRC Pilgrimage and England's Cathedrals Project. The impact of the interconnected strands will have a transformative effect on partners and other stakeholders and engage new local, national and international audiences. Some impact is necessarily focused in the period 2018-2020 but most outputs will have significantly longer legacies. All outputs are responses to clearly-articulated partner needs and will thus be fully embedded in their plans. Impact will be evaluated, collated and compared through partner networks.

Chief beneficiaries will be:

1. CANTERBURY CATHEDRAL, CITY COUNCIL, OTHER TOURISM STAKEHOLDERS in developing a more integrated tourist offer for Canterbury to extend visitor stays and income. The Cathedral currently welcomes 1 million visitors annually. Its &amp;pound;24.7 million Canterbury Journey project addresses the need for new interpretation, especially for younger audiences. Creation of the digital model of the medieval Cathedral/City will supply an innovative visitor tool, visually demonstrating the multi-layered relationship between the Cathedral, Becket's shrine and the city which grew in response to pilgrim needs. This digital re-imagining is at the heart of the strategy to reconnect the city's heritage and will provide a narrative for reinvigorating relationships between its historic sites and widening visitor engagement

2. SCHOOLS USING EDUCATION RESOURCES PRODUCED. Resources will support teaching of History KS3 &amp;amp; 4 (Church and State), Literature (Chaucer) and RE (pilgrimage, sacred places, suffering for one's beliefs). The 3D models will be accompanied by primary sources; images; pilgrim records/narratives; material on Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, holy places, and pilgrimage today. Canterbury Diocesan Education Dept. and the Canterbury Cathedral Learning team have identified these strands as being the maerials schools need most, locally and nationally

3. THE CANTERBURY JOURNEY TEAM, THE BRITISH MUSEUM, CANTERBURY MUSEUMS &amp;amp; GALLERIES, MUSEUM OF LONDON AND THEIR AUDIENCES through the shaping/delivery of exhibition and website material for 2020 and beyond. Outputs will provide new, dynamic, interactive engagement tools for local, national and international audiences

4. PARTICIPANTS IN DRAMA, POETRY, ART AND CRAFT WORKSHOPS WITH THE MARLOWE THEATRE AND THE CANTERBURY JOURNEY. These workshops, designed to stimulate creative contemporary responses to the Becket story from all age groups, will be offered to the Canterbury Journey project local and regional target audiences, including areas of deprivation, and to new and existing users of the Marlowe outreach service, which has an excellent track record of connecting with young people and hard-to-reach groups (see Letters of Support)

5. VISITORS TO CANTERBURY CATHEDRAL IN 2020, INCLUDING THOSE ATTENDING THE INTERNATIONAL LAMBETH CONFERENCE; CATHEDRAL STAFF AND VOLUNTEERS. The supply of trails for visitors, materials for the Cathedral's planned special services to mark the triple centenary, and material for a youth conference, will support Cathedral staff and volunteers in delivering an event of international interest. Visitors from around the world will be able to connect with the Becket story, which has considerable international and interdenominational resonance, and explore its relevance for today

6. THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND, MANAGERS OF SACRED SITES, AND STATUTORY ADVISORS attending the conference on shrines and relics chaired by Dr John Inge, lead bishop on cathedrals for the Church of England. Current moves to reinstate shrines and re-acquire relics challenges historic Anglican practice and poses very significant questions for cathedral staff and advisors. The conference offers the first opportunity to debate the issues at national level and will help shape national Church policy and statutory advice</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>80647</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/R008094/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>2C2F94EA-88C5-492D-B73E-AC67963698EA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Religious History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
