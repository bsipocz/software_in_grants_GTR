years senior management experience in the packaging machine industry and the specialist
design and manufacture of packaging machine systems. As a truly international business, its
packaging machinery is used by major clients in numerous locations, including the US,
Canada, Japan and various states in Africa. In sectors such as pharmaceutical and seasonal
food retail, delays or downtime are unacceptable and CPack has established a reputation for
reliable, robust products combined with responsive service and sales support.
Whilst the company is successful, the management are aware that the current machine range
is becoming dated and at the end of its development life. With the trend towards increased
flexibility and through-put machines, realising productivity gains for the clients, it is essential
that CPack addresses its loss of competitiveness quickly if it is to ensure its longer term
viability and increase market share.
This project will aim to design a generic, ?next generation? pre-production machine for
extensive trials and testing. The machine will be using a computer based technology program
to replicate movements that have previously been obtained through mechanical means &amp;amp;
equipment. The project will be the first of its kind using new technology that is both
sophisticated enough to allow this project to take place and which has only been available at
an acceptable cost during the past couple of years.
The key project objective is to develop a new wrapping machine designed to meet the
changing and more demanding needs of the market, that will have a life span of at least 20
years and that can be manufactured at a cost that enables CPack to compete aggressively in
the international marketplace. Market research has clearly identified that the creation of such
a machine will attract considerable UK and overseas interest.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>160644</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">720432</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
