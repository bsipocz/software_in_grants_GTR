The capability to work on sustainable feedstock and address those which have little or no cellulose within their structure is critically important in order to utilise a wide range of biomass sources for biofuel production. 

This project will expand the previous work on 2,5-Dimethylfuran (DMF), to cover the research on production technology converting biomass to furan series as well as characterisation of a more attractive furanic family member 2-Methylfuran (MF). Biomass derived fuels like MF is not the only product formed from the biomass conversion. Bio MF is produced as a mixture with other compounds, referred to henceforth as MF-c (MF compounds), resulting from the degradation of the original biomass. The present project aims to investigate systematically a whole technological pathway for the use and production of furanics (MF and MF compounds) as novel engine fuels via biomass conversion. The research will involve bioenergy and engine combustion technological areas and it will target the following specific objectives: 
1) To investigate the behaviours and combustion characteristics of MF and real-world MF-c based bio-oil in engines using experimental and numerical approaches
2) To improve understanding of mechanisms for production of bio-oils with MF and MF-c starting with lignocellulosic biomass 
3) To develop practical technology and process for efficient production of biofuels containing MF and MF-c
4) To investigate the impact of MF (MF-c) (including non-conventional emissions) involving health issues of users and CO2 footprint in the production and application of MF based biofuels 

The research programme will consist of 3 main Work Packages (WP): WP1 concerns the assessment of MF/MF-c performance in engines as fuels. Fundamental theoretical studies will be carried out to investigate the fuel properties of MF and MF-c bio-oils and expanded knowledge will be obtained about the fuel in terms of ignition and combustion chemistry compared with main components of gasoline and diesel. Advanced optical diagnostics will be applied to study the spray and combustion processes of MF and MF blends. WP2 concerns advancement of MF production methodology. A variety of lignocellulosic biomass residues will be characterised for their elemental, physical and chemical properties and by using TG-MS techniques the optimal biomass type and biomass degradation conditions which produces optimal yields of furfural and furfural alcohol as intermediate pyrolysis products will be determined. WP3 is for assessment of the toxicity of MF and impact on the environment. It will involve experimental study to determine whether MF is genotoxic at low concentrations. The results, in combination with information about predicted levels of human exposure to MF would then be used to form the basis of a more rational risk-assessment of the toxicity of MF in humans and the safety of MF as an alternative fuel source.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The growing transport sector represents a significant proportion of the energy consumption and it has been reported that it contributed to over 20% of UK CO2 emissions. The technology roadmap is to shift to increase substantially the production of biofuels by using innovative commercially viable processes and technologies. The knowledge of the biomass derived Methyl-Furans (MF) as biofuels to be developed by this project will be not only to answer the questions from the automotive industry with respect to their interest in furan fuels due to their advantages in making the combustion engines more efficient and clean but also to explore the technology pathways for a low CO2 foot print using novel catalytic technology in biofuel production. At the same time, the research will assess the toxicity of MF and its furan family and respond to the concerns of the public on this issue. The outcome will have a significant impact on the current movement to new biofuels with a great contribution to the reduction of global energy consumption and CO2 emissions and thus contribute to the environmental protection. 

This project will be a cross-disciplinary collaborative research involving Mechanical Engineering, Chemical Engineering and Bioscience. It will also be supported by the best relevant international partners for collaboration in this field. The collaboration will include Fraunhofer, National University of Ireland Galway, Tsinghua University and will be supported by JLR, Green Fuels and Shell Global Solutions (UK) as local industry partners. It has great potential to develop international collaboration beyond the community of automotive engineering in the field of biofuel research and development, across the boundaries of the academic and industry. It will provide evidence in advancement of application of fuel chemistry and production technology in biomass utilisation and understanding of combustion of MF family as candidates of biofuels for IC engines. This systematic research will provide a large and comprehensive data base for the biofuels MF family and contribute to the expansion of the knowledge on MF production and application as biofuel candidates. The project will maintain the R&amp;amp;D of furan series biofuel technology in the UK at an international leading level, on top of the completed world leading work on DMF. 

The progress will be closely monitored by industrial partners with the outcome at every step targeting the benefit in its application. This project will generate a considerable amount of knowledge to advance the biofuel research and development. The new knowledge will be exploited and used by industry partners. The benefits of the project will be passed to the public, providing a knowledge base in all the researched areas and contributing to the global strategy study for the sustainable production and use of biofuels. The know-how acquired in this project will be of direct benefit to the UK and European motor industries because any changes in future fuels will apply a significant influence to their business strategy and plan-making for future products. The project outcome may also help to increase the market size of the UK and Europe's biofuel industries. The project will put the UK's research on MF as a new generation biofuel in a leading position. The research results, however, will not be limited to the products of the industrial partners and shall be available for exploitation by all members of the consortium within the agreed distribution of IP. As the results of the research are published, it will be possible for all the other researchers to share the information about the new developments. Clearly, the beneficiaries of this first attempt to research the applications of MF and its family in direct injection engines will not only be the UK and Europe but also the international community and push forward the development of biomass derived biofuels.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>931604</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Tsinghua University China</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>China, People's Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Partnership with Tsinghua University</gtr:description><gtr:id>0D23F679-AE71-4525-8472-2A3460E50642</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b966248eb96624ac-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>Tsinghhua University is ranked as no 1 university in China.

In parallel to this, a variety of lignocellulosic biomass residues will be characterised for their elemental, physical and chemical properties and by using TG-MS techniques the optimal biomass type and biomass degradation conditions which produces optimal yields of furfural and furfural alcohol as intermediate pyrolysis products will be determined. This will establish a fundamental understanding of the thermal degradation behaviour of the feedstocks as well as an understanding of the chemical compounds produced during pyrolysis of the feedstock. Upon characterisation, these feedstocks will be tested in a pilot scale TCR reactor for production of bio-oils. Reaction conditions, temperature, solid residence times and pellet compression ratios will be optimised to achieve maximum yields of liquid intermediates containing furfural and furfural alcohols. The biooils produced will be characterised to determine their fuel physical and chemical compositions. This work package will establish the TCR process to deliver sufficient yields of bio-oil intermediate products for further upgrading to MF-c. The second phase is to study a catalytic upgrading of TCR bio-oil to maximise the yields of 2-methylfuran. This work package task will aim towards upgrading the intermediate liquids produced from the first phase to MF-c by the catalytic hydro treatment (hydrodeoxygenation) of intermediate bio-oils under a range of catalysts. Initially the process will be optimised for selectivity towards MF-c by using standard Cu catalysts. This work package task aims towards optimising the catalytic upgrading conditions for the economic production of MF-c from TCR intermediate liquids. Sufficient quantities will be produced for subsequent engine tests.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>combustion and emission characteristics of novel bio-fuels developed</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Fraunhofer Society</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Fraunhofer Institute for Environmental, Safety, and Energy Technology</gtr:department><gtr:description>Link with Fraunhofer Germany</gtr:description><gtr:id>36A54697-1ACC-4E00-925E-235E5F4F2E6F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>this collaboration is multi-disciplinary</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c96dfdb6f4a0.79422301-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The Institute provides technical support</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We have shared research outcome and discussions during two of their visits and meetings.

There is evidence that MF can cause deposits in engine combustion onto the injector especially direct injection engines and this makes the engine performance and emissions deteriorate with time. The problem has become a big challenge to motor and fuel industry, if MF is to be used as biofuel. We have carried out a lot of research work on the combustion of MF and deposits in engines. Clearly our publications have received good attention and thus I was invited to this workshop to give a talk on the subject, showing how we can identify the way to mitigate the problem.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c969f17c87e4.64963381</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.sae.org</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>931604</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Study of Novel Biofuels from Biomass - Methyl-Furans (MF)</gtr:description><gtr:end>2019-01-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>02DFFC1C-CD95-4FE0-9736-1A2325AB1F4A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d0431551a9a0.76575326</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-02-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>214000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Jaguar new high performance engine</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-11-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Jaguar Land Rover</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>9919E187-8040-4219-AE06-04BD69D75801</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c96fb2542d86.60745819</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Biofuels are considered a medium term solution for reducing the transportation emissions and dependence on fossil fuels. Among many options of biofuel production and supply, biomass derived fuels are the most attractive because they do not lead to additional CO2 emissions. Furan series have started to receive increasing attention as a novel fuel candidate since the breakthrough of making 2,5-Dimethylfuran (DMF), reported by both Nature and Science in 2007. A later development was devoted to high yield production of 2-Methylfuran (MF). Increasingly more extensive research on furan series have been reported in recent years and advantages of MF and other furan components are merging as well as DMF. This project will examine for first-time in world the combustion characteristics of the multi-component MF based compound family and their impact on the performance and emissions of internal combustion engines as well as the environment and effect on human health. The work will be carried out in close collaboration between Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, Chemical Engineering and Biosciences at University of Birmingham.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Recent work on combustion properties and emissions of Methylfuran in engines as well as combustion vessel provide benchmark information which is of tremendous interest to industries as well as other researchers. The findings will encourage further optimization of the MF/MF-c production process as well as interests from automotive industries which would push the compounds towards the best candidate for gasoline/diesel substitute.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>35472B59-F6F7-4A34-9C3A-1E46AC70E2EC</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c9ae572e3a98.83947901</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Energy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Our group is one of the first groups to investigate DMF as a potential engine-fuel. Combustion, emission characteristics of DMF fuelled DISI engines and effect of spark timing and load was investigated extensively. Results of such experiments provide valuable information about the usability of novel fuels in an engine under practical conditions. Investigations currently carried out are extended beyond DMF towards MF, MTHF and their blends with gasoline or diesel.</gtr:description><gtr:id>EC43F931-550B-4AF5-920C-618AC0E32217</gtr:id><gtr:impact>An investigation of hydrocarbon (HC) and aldehyde emissions from the combustion of MF was conducted, with samples taken from the exhaust of the single cylinder direct-injection spark ignition (SI) research engine. The measurements reported in the work validates the mechanism of MF combustion, and assesses its toxic emissions. Reaction pathway analyses of the combustion of MF and DMF have also been performed using a closed homogeneous constant volume reactor model in the Chemkin package. Aldehyde emissions from MF were quantitatively measured using high performance liquid chromatography, and the results were compared with those of gasoline, 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF), ethanol, methanol, and n-butanol. The detected aldehydes were mainly formaldehyde and acetaldehyde. The formaldehyde emission was related to the side chain reactions of MF. The methyl-groups in MF/DMF formed due to the H-addition reactions are found to be the main source for the aldehyde emissions. It was only half that of emissions from DMF cases and it was much lower than those of other fuels. The acetaldehyde emission from MF was also one of the lowest among all tested fuels. HCs from MF combustion were qualitatively investigated using gas chromatography mass spectrometry. The exhaust spectrum detected signals from propylene, benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, xylenes, carbonyl compounds, and furan series derivatives (furan, DMF, and furfural).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c9b9701643c3.71052764</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Engine performance and emissions using MF/MF-c biofuels</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Fundamental properties of a fuel combustion such as the laminar flame speed is critical for characterizing a fuel, developing models for the kinetic mechanisms and for the optimized design of future engines by the industry.</gtr:description><gtr:id>5465E46C-60A8-49CA-9A2E-EB82EA087E98</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Laminar burning characteristics for MF and blends have been investigated in the past and were compared with properties of DMF resulting in multiple international journal publications. In the last term, the laminar combustion studies were carried out using 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MTHF) which is a promising second-generation novel-biofuel candidate produced from furfurals, a common MF based compound. The results were compared with ethanol and isooctane, a representative component in gasoline. The measurements show that for most tests, the ranking of unstretched flame propagation speed is ethanol, 2-MTHF followed by isooctane. The Markstein length calculations indicate that isooctane has a more diffusion-thermal stable flame than 2-MTHF and ethanol when F &amp;lt; 1.2 at 393 K. The laminar burning velocity of 2-MTHF is much faster than isooctane and is comparative with ethanol, indicating its fast-burning property and potential of improving engine thermal efficiency.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c9b808678b57.38321677</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Laminar combustion characteristics of
