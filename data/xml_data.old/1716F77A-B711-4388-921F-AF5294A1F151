Two people can communicate if they are within distance 1 from each other. A graph is a mathematical object that can be used to model such a network. We think of the people as the vertices of the graph and we connect two of them by a line segment of length 1 (that we call edge) if they can communicate. Is this graph connected? In other words, can a rumour spread to the whole network? 

If the answer to this question is yes, then the natural next question is: how well-connected is the network? This is not a well-posed question. One way of interpreting this is by asking whether removing an edge of this graph can change the connectivity property. Another natural way to probe the geometry of the graph is to analyse the behaviour of a random walk. A random walk models a particle moving on the vertices of the graph, at each time step jumping to a random neighbour. 

Mixing, hitting and cover times are fundamental quantities that reveal features of the underlying graph's geometry and connectivity. The mixing time represents how long it takes the random walk to reach equilibrium, the hitting time is the time it takes for a random walk starting from one vertex to hit another, and the cover time is the amount of time it takes for the random walk to visit every vertex in the graph.

Graphs serve to model many real-world situations. However, most networks are not static in nature, but change with time. So it is natural to introduce dynamics and study properties of graphs whose connectivity properties change with time. In this setting studying mixing, hitting and covering properties of a random walk can give insight on the geometry and connectivity properties of the dynamical graph. 

A lot of the classical tools used to analyse processes on static graphs do not carry over to the time-inhomogeneous setting. So in order to study mixing, hitting and covering properties of the walks we will need to develop new tools and techniques.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Graphs are used as models for networks in economics, computer science and mathematics. Understanding the behaviour of a random walk on a graph reveals information about the graph's geometry and connectivity properties. Most networks are dynamic in nature, so it is natural to introduce dynamics and study random walks on graphs that evolve with time. 

The proposed research aims at a better understanding of the behaviour of such processes. A major difficulty in this setting comes from the fact that once the underlying graph structure is fixed, then the random walk becomes a time-inhomogeneous Markov chain where techniques from the time-homogeneous setting do not usually transfer. We plan to refine existing techniques developed by the PI and others recently in order to study mixing, hitting and covering properties of random walks on dynamical graphs. We also plan to develop new tools and techniques to study time-inhomogeneous Markov chains. We expect to be able to transfer some of the recent work relating different notions of mixing developed by the PI and others building on earlier work of Aldous, Lovasz and Winkler. 

We plan to disseminate our results both in the mathematics and the computer science communities. We plan to attend international conferences and workshops and interact and collaborate with researchers from both fields. We plan to continue our collaboration with Microsoft Research in the US and with Thomas Sauerwald from the computer science department in Cambridge. We also plan to establish a collaboration with Colin Cooper from the computer science department at King's College London. Work on this project will enhance the already strong bonds between probability and computer science in the UK.

The UK has a long tradition in probability. The proposed topics are at the centre of an international research effort and funding this project will give the UK visibility in the international scene. It will also strengthen collaboration between researchers in the UK with those in France, Germany, Holland, the US, and elsewhere.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>113961</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R022615/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>04D8FF87-2CFC-44E7-A7DF-47E10C813E05</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>80</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical Analysis</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>62309876-5C71-411C-B1A7-1B2907AFB5A8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Statistics &amp; Appl.
