For example, some languages allow contrastive phrases to appear in sentence-initial position, as when one speaker corrects another: \n\n(1) Speaker A: Mary bought a new dress for Christmas.\n Speaker B: No, you're wrong. A new SKIRT Mary bought for Christmas.\n\nIn this research project, we use experimental techniques to investigate sentences in which a phrase that contains 'old' information appears in an earlier position in the sentence than it normally would. This very local word-order alternation is exemplified in the Dutch examples below.\n\n(2a) Marie heeft gisteren het boek gekocht.\n Mary has yesterday the book bought\n\n(2b) Marie heeft het boek gisteren gekocht.\n Mary has the book yesterday bought\n\n 'Mary has bought the book yesterday.'\n\nIn (2a), where 'het boek' (the book) follows 'gisteren' (yesterday), this phrase is interpreted as new information, whereas the order in (2b) requires previous mention of 'the book' in the ongoing discourse.\n\nOur primary objective is to uncover empirical evidence that would allow us to choose between two competing analyses of the non-canonical order in (2b). \n\nAccording to the first analysis, (2b) is derived from (2a) by a so-called movement operation, which leaves behind an unpronounced copy of the moved constituent, as shown in (3), where '(het boek)' represents the unpronounced copy of the moved constituent '[het boek]':\n\n(3) Marie heeft [het boek] gisteren (het boek) gekocht.\n\nAccording to the second analysis, (2a) and (2b) are not related by movement, but differ in the way their basic structures are built. In particular, in (2a) 'het boek' combines with the verb to form a constituent after which 'gisteren' combines with that constituent to create a yet larger constituent, whereas in (2b) 'het boek' and 'gisteren' combine with the verb in the opposite order. On this second analysis, there is therefore no silent copy of 'het boek' between 'gisteren' and the verb. \n\nPrevious experiments with movement structures of the type illustrated in (1) have established that the creation of a silent copy of movement causes the moved phrase to be 'reactivated' in the hearer's mind. Such experiments are carefully designed to track the moment-by-moment steps in which the hearer constructs a mental representation of a sentence and can reliably identify the locus of a silent copy. In the present study, we make use of this technique to verify whether sentences like (2b) are formed by movement or not.\n\nWe supplement this study with a further paper-and-pencil questionnaire that probes the interpretion of sentences like (2b) when they contain so-called quantified phrases, such as 'every man' and 'every Tuesday'. Such quantified phrases interact with indefinites, such as 'a book', to yield ambiguity in sentences like 'John read a book every Tuesday', which may be interpreted as expressing either that John reads the same book every Tuesday, or that John reads a potentially different book every Tuesday. The two analyses of (2b) outlined above make different predictions about interactions of this type between the displaced constituent and the modifier to its right. The planned off-line experiments should therefore be able to provide additional evidence for one or the other analysis.\n\nThe results from these experiments will provide us with new types of data to extend and improve our existing knowledge of sentence structure in an area where purely theoretical work has reached a stalemate.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Theoretical linguistics is a foundational discipline within cognitive science with its principal applications in language teaching, language disorders, and language technology. The current project seeks to contribute to a central debate in this field about the extent to which interpretive notions, whether in the domain of argument structure or in the domain of information structure, are directly encoded in syntactic representations. One view holds that this is the case for virtually all such notions, so that the mapping from syntactic structure to a representation of meaning is trivial (because essentially one-to-one). A more moderate school of thinking leaves open the possibility that there is a certain amount of 'flexibility' in syntactic structures, so that a particular interpretation is not uniformly associated with a single structural property. The outcomes of the present experimental study will directly impact on this debate in linguistics, because it will uncover evidence that bears on this controversy in the domain of argument structure.\n\nThe project will also contribute to, and help advance, the budding field of experimental syntax. Previously, experimental rigour in linguistic research has been virtually absent from the field of syntax. Rather, data collection has been limited to informally asking a few native speaker for their judgments, sometimes including or even limited to the researcher. Our use of off-line experiments to collect statistically reliable scope judgment data, and our use of on-line techniques borrowed from experimental psychology, will contribute to the development of new standards for syntactic and semantic research.\n\nThe project is concerned with fundamental research in cognitive science. As such it does not have any short-term direct impact on users or beneficiaries outside the academic research community, even though it contributes to a wider body of research in theoretical linguistics that does have direct impacts. This wider body of research contributes to quality of life in the broad sense, in that there is considerable public interest in research that sheds light on the nature of our our cognitive mechanisms (including those subserving language) and ultimately on the workings of the human brain. However, the detailed theoretical questions addressed in the present research do not lend themselves to transmission to a wider audience. For these reasons, the attached Pathways to Impact document merely repeats the outlook presented here.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>95951</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This research aimed to provide experimental evidence to choose between two competing linguistic analyses of so-called 'neutral scrambling' in Dutch and German. This is a word order alternation, where a Noun Phrase like &amp;quot;the book&amp;quot; is displaced leftward in a sentence when it has been previously mentioned in the discourse. This displacement might involve movement, in which case it should leave a silent copy that can be experimentally detected, or it might not involve movement at all, but be generated in the displaced position in the sentence. The research carried out under this award has established that for Dutch the experimental evidence suggests a base-generation analysis rather than a movement analysis. The outcome was reported in a paper published in the journal &amp;quot;The Linguistic Review&amp;quot;. A presentation about this work was selected for presentation at the prestigious GLOW conference (GLOW 37, held in Brussels in April 2014). The experiments carried out on German data did not yield any statistically reliable results, and therefore did not lead to any output.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The experimental results reported for Dutch neutral scrambling can and should be further investigated.
