This increase has been observed in the UK as well as worldwide and overconsumption of food is thought to be a major culprit. Foods that are very high in sugar and fat, commonly known as junk foods, are thought to be particularly to blame. It is well known that many of us find it difficult to resist eating such foods. In fact, many of the behaviours that these foods induce - binge eating, inability to control intake, and insensitivity to negative consequences - parallel behaviours seen towards addictive drugs. Together with recent evidence showing substantial overlap between parts of the brain activated by exposure to drugs and food, this suggests a role for certain brain regions in controlling dysfunctional behaviours towards food and underlying the rise in obesity. However, despite these recent advances a key question still remains: do junk foods have such a strong effect on the brain and behaviour because they taste good (i.e. they are very sweet or fatty) or because of their nutritional value (i.e. they are packed with calories)?

The main question this proposal seeks to answer is how does the nutritional value of food (i.e. its caloric content) lead to activity in the brain and how does this affect behaviour. This question will be addressed by recording chemical and electrical signals from a brain region called the nucleus accumbens; this region is known to be essential for producing behaviour towards things that we find rewarding. Recordings will be made while rats drink saccharin solution, an artificial sweetener that does not contain any calories. This solution may or may not be accompanied by infusions of glucose (sugar) directly into the stomach. It is expected that when saccharin is paired with glucose infusions rats will drink more and approach the bottle more quickly when it is offered than if saccharin is paired with water infusions.

Two type of physiological recording will be made during this behaviour. First, the neurotransmitter dopamine will be recorded using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry. This technique uses a small carbon-fibre sensor to detect dopamine at a rapid rate. Thus, brief changes can be aligned to specific behaviours, for example, approach to the bottle containing saccharin. Dopamine is essential for learning about rewards such as food and our hypothesis is that dopamine signals will be increased by glucose infusions.

Second, electrical activity from individual neurons (brain cells) will be recorded using electrophysiology. Information is transmitted throughout the brain via electrical impulses known as action potentials and these can be recorded by placing thin wire electrodes in the brain. Changes in the number of these action potentials occur in response to certain events or behaviours. In nucleus accumbens, the region we are interested in, neurons combine information from many areas in order to generate a behavioural output. Thus, understanding how these neurons fire in response to different events, behaviours, and rewards is an important step in linking the experience of food to its behavioural consequences. In this proposal, it is expected that glucose infusions will alter neuronal activity in the nucleus accumbens.

Finally, behaviour and neuronal activity will be manipulated by targeting a specific connection in the brain between the hypothalamus and dopamine cells. This will be done in two ways: with drugs that target a certain protein known to be important for sensing glucose, and with a technique called optogenetics, which allows expression of molecules which can be activated by light in specific brain cells.

Completion of this work will provide a new perspective on several fields of neuroscience. In the longer term, it will inform public policy with regard to healthcare, nutrition and education and, ultimately, it may also help us better understand why we choose to eat the foods that we do.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>This proposal will determine encoding of nutritional value in nucleus accumbens (NAc) by using in vivo methods to record physiological signals while rats consume a solution of variable nutritional value.

Specifically, in vivo fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (Obj. 1) and extracellular single-unit electrophysiology (Obj. 2) will be used to measure dopamine release and neuronal activity, respectively. A behavioural paradigm will be used in which behaviour towards a sweet solution and associated cues is enhanced (increased consumption and decreased approach latency) by pairing its consumption with intragastric (IG) administration of glucose. Control rats will receive IG water, which will not affect behaviour. Dopamine release and neuronal activity will be sampled across NAc core and shell subregions during this learning process and are expected to show features of encoding that correlate with behavioural alterations.

In Obj. 3, the role of lateral hypothalamus (LH) input to dopamine cells of ventral tegmental area (VTA) will be assessed by using site-specific pharmacology and optogenetics. First, K-ATP channels will be targeted due to their role as glucose sensors in LH. Drugs that open K-ATP channels (thus, preventing LH cells from sensing glucose) and drugs that block K-ATP channels (thus, enhancing the ability of LH cells to sense glucose) will be micro-injected into LH to disrupt conditioning to glucose and enhance conditioning in the absence of glucose, respectively. Second, terminals in VTA arising from LH will be targeted for expression of excitatory (channelrhodopsin) or inhibitory (ArchT) light-activated effectors. Illumination of terminals will result in bidirectional modulation of conditioning as described in 3a. In 3a and 3b, neuronal activity will be measured in NAc and, concurrent with behavioural alterations, manipulations of the LH to VTA pathway will result in a change in encoding of nutritional value within NAc.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Currently, throughout society, our relationship to the food we eat is of intense concern. In particular, why do we choose to eat the foods that we do and what is it about certain foods that makes them so irresistible? This proposal will probe a basic mechanism that is likely to be directly relevant to these questions. Namely, how does the nutritional value of food (i.e. its caloric content) interact with the brain to drive behaviour towards food? Thus, although this project is very much basic science and will have immediate impact for academic neuroscientists, its conclusions will be of interest and relevance to the wider public. Moreover, its findings have the potential to inform areas of the public sector (healthcare and education) and the private sector (food manufacturing and pharmaceutical industry).

In the short term, as mentioned above, the immediate beneficiaries of this work will be the academic community. Knowledge about how post-ingestive mechanisms affect behaviour towards food will be of interest and relevance to several subfields of neuroscience. Specifically, these are academics interested in the role of dopamine in reward processing - both food and drugs - and those interested in mechanisms of learning and memory. In addition, this work might inform wider disciplines such as people interested in making artificial neural networks and modelling how the brain works computationally.

In the longer term, this work will have more far-reaching impact and will lead to a better understanding of how post-ingestive processes contribute to the choices we make about food. This will have outcomes for the wider public by informing our general conceptualization of how feeding patterns develop. Understanding the difference between drinking a regular can of Coca-Cola and a diet version, in terms of how it is likely to affect our future behaviour, will give the public greater control over their dietary choices. In addition, this information will be available for health education professionals to put policies in place that will better help people control their health. In particular, as the processes being investigated here relate to how behaviour towards nutritionally-valuable foods is acquired, it may be necessary to disrupt this process from being started and, as with many health issues, prevention is likely to be easier than treatment.

In the private sector, food manufacturers, who are constantly devising new and supposedly healthier alternatives, will be able to use this work to optimise the design of diet/health foods. With a better and more nuanced understanding of processes that link nutritional value of food to motivation it will be possible for food design to be accomplished in a more targeted manner. These improvements in food design will benefit the nation's health and well-being as well as providing economic opportunities in the food industry.

This project will employ a postdoc who will benefit from extended scientific training; specifically, the use of high-level technical approaches and novel analytical techniques to study physiological processes in vivo. In addition, this individual will also continue their professional development with respect to oral presentations, writing and manuscript preparation, and networking. In addition, training opportunities will be available for undergraduate and MSc students who will gain valuable laboratory experience as well as training in analysis and presentation skills.

Specific milestones are expected to be reached in Year 1 (completed recordings of dopamine release during conditioning), Year 2 (completion of electrophysiology during conditioning), and Year 3 (manipulations of behaviour/encoding through targeting of LH-VTA projection). Each of these projects is expected to produce a top-tier publication.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>442568</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E8C3709A-3E8B-4EC0-B870-C5368A0A7F78</gtr:id><gtr:title>The role of dopamine in the pursuit of nutritional value.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Physiology &amp; behavior</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/aa83d72b9f54611649245fd2c6347849"><gtr:id>aa83d72b9f54611649245fd2c6347849</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>McCutcheon JE</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0031-9384</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>585d7612e386f5.98465158</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8A5A5903-6FF4-408F-952A-6F2AF4C97CFC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Restriction of dietary protein leads to conditioned protein preference and elevated palatability of protein-containing food in rats.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Physiology &amp; behavior</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/06053bc028cb0f09a627f517c1f40862"><gtr:id>06053bc028cb0f09a627f517c1f40862</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Murphy M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0031-9384</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a7ab3f47db925.68697013</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/M007391/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>48D25546-6ADF-479A-8877-478CCDB1DC1F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Animal Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>455F5D87-6317-4EF0-9D74-72B5D9BD6375</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Food science &amp; nutrition</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E793F7FE-614C-4A45-83A0-BE79B172092C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Animal &amp; human physiology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>790AD28C-6380-4025-83C2-6881B93C4602</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Animal behaviour</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EE9084A7-FE6C-4C9D-A9CD-9DE995623422</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biological Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>446B7E7F-04EB-4121-9CC6-9171277E00DA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Diet &amp; health</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E1AC33C6-9927-41AC-B23B-2EED8F593588</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Experimental Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
