Survey</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/K005987/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>The Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) is a unique, multidisciplinary research resource. Following the lives of over 19,000 children born across the UK around the turn of the millennium, it has collected information about and from them at ages nine months, three, five, seven and eleven years.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Sweep six will comprise a further survey of the MCS cohort at age 14 as a critical point in young people's lives.This is a time when people are in-between childhood and adulthood, when many trajectories are still possible, but many will also be heavily influenced by the choices and behaviours they engage in at this age. The measures we capture at age 14 will be significant for addressing their relation to later life outcomes and enabling understanding of change over time through cross-cohort comparisons.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The age 14 sweep will utilise a variety of data collection instruments comprising interviews and self-completion with both parents; interview and self-completion with the cohort member; measures of height, weight and body fat; direct assessments of cognitive functioning; a time diary; and collection of consent to administrative data linkage.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>MCS Sweep six will cover the age 14 survey development; data collection; data deposit; dissemination, capacity building and user engagement.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The Millennium Cohort Study is a multi-disciplinary survey covering a wide range of topics. The breadth of coverage and the depth of information from six sweeps of data covering UK children's lives up to age 14 make it of interest to a wide range of beneficiaries. 
Academics from numerous disciplines, including child health, psychology, economics, epidemiology, human geography, sociology, social policy and social statistics will benefit from clean, high quality and well documented longitudinal data, covering issues of salience throughout childhood and in the teenage years. Supplementary data sets incorporating geographical identifiers or linked administrative data will increase their benefit. MCS6 will be of interest not only to UK but also international scholars, whether for comparative studies with, for example Fragile Families or the NLSY, or in its own right as a unique source for understanding children's development trajectories. 
Students will also benefit from the availability of high quality and wide ranging data. They will also be able to draw on the associated training and capacity building activities and the user support linked to the study.
Those developing cohort studies whether from birth (such as the new UK Birth Cohort Study) or in the teen years (such as Tokyo Teen study) will benefit from examplars with which to harmonise as well as being able to draw on the longitudinal expertise linked to the study and gain advice on sampling, instrument development, tracing, participant engagement and ethics.
Methodologists will be able to utilise the data to explore issues such as attrition, non-response and consent in a longitudinal context. For example, by age 14 the number of sweeps, and the changes in inter-sweep periods, facilitates complex modeling of patterns of participation. Survey methodologists and survey practitioners will also benefit indirectly from the methodological research associated with the age 14 sweep such as experimentation on responses to well-being questions a field experiment relating to maximising response, and the dissemination of this research to academic and practitioner audiences
Policy makers will largely benefit indirectly through research findings that are relevant to their areas of interest. The coverage of the age 14 survey both on its own and as a culmination of six sweeps of data collection will be of interest to policy officers and analysts across Whitehall as well as in the devolved administrations. The MCS will provide them with a unique understanding of how children are growing up in the UK today, their different starting points, outcomes and trajectories across a range of highly relevant areas including health, education, family context and change, attitudes, aspirations, sporting and cultural participation, friendship and victimisation, and risk behaviours and attitudes. Policy makers can also benefit directly through analysts' access to the data, and through provision of bespoke data sets to ease use of the complex data for specific purposes.
The MCS is of great interest to a number of voluntary sector organisations, particularly those concerned with parenting and child welfare. It provides an invaluable resource for research connected to their key interests, whether in shared care, maternal depression, 'good parenting', child poverty; disabled children or educational development. The age 14 sweep will increase the interest of MCS to these research consumers. Again, for those with analytical capacity the data can be used directly to explore key concerns; and collaborations with data analysts are also possible, through, for example the ESRC secondary analysis scheme. 
Finally, the age 14 sweep will be of indirect benefit to children and families themselves as research on the study identifies what factors in family context and behaviours make a difference to child outcomes, and points to ways in which they can be supported and their experiences enhanced in the future.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>8370933</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University College London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>International Centre for Lifecourse Studies in Society and Health (ICLS)</gtr:department><gtr:description>Joint paper on MCS with International Centre for Lifecourse Studies in Society and Health</gtr:description><gtr:id>4C545D71-A403-462F-AFFD-4E0763371B77</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Working paper 'Longitudinal associations between television in the bedroom and body fatness in a UK cohort study', under revise and resubmit at International Journal of Obesity.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bd5308ed6ac4.22977649-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Lead on empirical analysis</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Working paper on the relationship between children's screen time and weight, using the Millennium Cohort Study.

In this research project we explore the feasibility of conducting a longitudinal survey, which would capture the full picture of the growing-up process possibly from birth to the end of a child/young person's education. As part of this they are undertaking a review of key national and international longitudinal surveys in order to:
? Understand key design decisions (population coverage, sample design, questionnaire development and testing methods used, etc.)
? Learn lessons from the above about what worked well and what worked less well (particularly regarding participation) to support recommendations that will be made to the European Commission.

The STATA coding was excellent.

An excellent course that gave me a better understanding of how I could use MCS in the future.

Everything was very useufl as I am new to the MCS data. Workshop was a great idea.

This would be considered a non-controversial response. The intuitive assumption when considering subjective wellbeing and psychological distress is that factors associated with one are associated with the other - albeit in the opposite direction. But what if we're wrong? What if wellbeing and mental illness, or happy and sad, are not two sides of the same mental health coin?

In this blog for World Mental Health Day, Dr Praveetha Patalay examines the factors that influence children's mental illness and wellbeing using the Millennium Cohort Study.

It is a large conference lasting 5 days with multiple strands parallel sessions at each time, attended by around 800 academics, professional survey practitioners and post-graduate students from around the world. 

This is one of the major international survey methodology conferences, which takes place biennially. It was attended by eight members of CLS staff. In total, we delivered and/or co-authored eleven presentations based on the three of our four cohort studies, covering surveying children and young people, collection of time-use and activity monitor data, data linkage, mixed-modes, event history calendars, para-data, DDI and interviewer training. Many of the presentations were joint with the survey agencies we have worked with on the studies (NatCen, IPSOS-MORI and TNS-BMRB). We are also organised seven conference sessions in total on surveying children and young people, collecting time-use data and administrative data linkage. 

Our presence at ESRA was backed up by a London-based social media strategy which involved tweets from the @clscohorts account to promote the presentations on the cohort studies and the sessions we organised. Two of the staff members also engaged in tweeting at the conference. It total we sent around 150 tweets making us among the top tweeters at the whole conference.

Data will be available to researchers at the end of March 2017, so as yet the impacts of this major new data set have to be realised. I predict major areas of research will, amongst others, include understanding the pathways to early risky behaviours, the important transition from primary to secondary school and how it affects aspects of life including relationships, socio-emotional and cognitive development; mental health and wellbeing; physical development and, in particular, trends in overweight and obesity. These are all critically important policy areas at present, and as such can be expected to have important influences on current debate and thinking. Over the coming few years, and as a result of some of the more novel content of the MCS6 sweep, I anticipate particularly significant impacts in the following areas: 

-Inclusion of genes in social science models: A crucial area for research is how genes and environments operate together to produce the inequalities we observe across the lifecourse. DNA samples from cohort members and parents arise from the age 14 sweep of the study. There are just over 20,000 samples in total, including approximately 4,600 mother-child-father trios. The planned genotyping of these samples in 2017/18 will create the largest collection of genetic samples from mother/child/father with detailed phenotypic measurements in the world, ensuring the MCS will be uniquely placed to enable research into the interplay of genetic and environmental factors in the development of inequalities across the life course. 
- Physical activity and sedentary behaviour in adolescence: There is a great deal of interest in understanding patterns of physical activity, including sedentary behaviour, and how these relate to young people's growth patterns, including rising trends in overweight, and to other aspects of their wellbeing and long-term outcomes. The availability of objective measures at age 14, through accelerometers, is a marked advance over more limited self-report measures. Alongside the accelerometry data collected at the age 7 sweep of the study, it will provide a comprehensive insight into patterns of moderate and intense activity, and sedentary behaviour, facilitating a rich understanding of the effects of health lifestyles on different domains of life.
- Understanding time use: the concurrently collected measures of time use over two 24 hour periods is a major innovation and will allow for detailed insights into adolescents' daily lives, alongside generating measure of adolescent time use for the study of later life outcomes as cohort matures (e.g. physical activities, sleep, eating patterns, cultural participation, time spent doing homework etc.). It will also facilitate cross-cultural comparisons of adolescent time use, for instance with the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, Longitudinal Study of Australian Children, Growing Up in Ireland, which have also been collecting time diaries.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2017</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>B6777A09-C21A-40DC-A7D3-5B7E0CA15696</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>58ca77cb010e10.41655777</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have successfully collected data on 11,726 families at the sixth sweep of the Millennium Cohort Study. The Age 14 sweep was the most ambitious sweep of MCS so far. It was a household based survey that collected information from parents, as well as from the cohort members themselves. It combined both interviewer-administered and self-completion instruments that built on best practice and technological developments, as well as direct measurements of young people's physical growth, and assessments of both young people and their parents' cognitive ability. It also collected saliva samples for DNA extraction from both cohort members and resident biological parents, and cohort members wore an activity monitor and completed a time use record over two 24 hour periods. The data have recently been deposited at the UKDS (available end March 2017), and await analysis by the academic community.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Data from teh age 14 sweep of the MCS has been deposited at UKDS.
