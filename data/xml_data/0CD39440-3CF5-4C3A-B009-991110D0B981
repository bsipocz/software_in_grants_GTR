Previous research suggests that refugees have high rates of mental distress which are related to their experience of war and other forms of trauma. We want to take this work further by focusing on the mental health of people who lived in the former Yugoslavia before coming to live in London. We want to find out if refugees are more likely to experience mental distress than those who choose to come to Britain for other reasons. We also want to find out if the circumstances in which people came to London affect their use of medical and other services. 
In general, there is very limited research in the UK on the mental health needs of refugees, and even less on the usefulness and appropriateness of refugee-specific health and social services. The purpose of this research is to provide UK based evidence on the pattern, evaluation, management and outcome of mental health problems in asylum seekers, refugees and ?elective? migrants. The information will be used to inform planning of health and social care programmes.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>This study will examine the impact that ?forced? and ?elective? migration have on the prevalence of mental disorder and the extent and pattern of help seeking among people from former Yugoslavia who are now living in London. Perceptions of mental health problems and views about the extent and type of help that is required will be explored from the perspective of study participants. 
While little research has been conducted among displaced people in the UK it is clear that mental health problems are more prevalent than among the general population. Migration is a process of loss as well as gain, especially loss of the familiar: land, language and law. This is common to all migrants, whether their displacement is chosen or forced. In order to plan services for current and future migrants it is important to establish whether differences in the reasons for migration impact on the extent of mental health problems. ?Elective? migrants deliberately chose to move out of their home country, mostly due to unfavourable economic circumstances. They are therefore more likely to be those of working age, healthy, and mentally prepared for a cultural change. Those who are forced out of their country due to war and violence, however, are likely to be from all age groups, to have underlying morbidity and to be more vulnerable to sudden changes in life course. While it might be expected that levels of mental distress will be therefore be higher among ?forced? migrants, differences in the extent and management of mental health problems in these groups have not been explored. Information about the prevalence and management of mental health problems among recent migrants is required in order to inform current service developments and assist those charged with planning the response to future migrants. By combining qualitative and quantitative research methods we aim to develop a better understanding of the mental health needs of one group of recent migrants (from former Yxplore the impact that the context of migration has on the extent of mental distress and help seeking behaviour. 
Preliminary work will be conducted in a form of qualitative research to gather detailed, in-depth information and gain better understanding of participants? expressed health needs. This will be followed by a historical cohort study to estimate the prevalence and magnitude of differences in psychological morbidity between two study groups, ?forced? versus ?elective? migrants, information unavailable to the UK to date.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2004-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>266099</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>CC7FAC4C-39AD-4025-BA78-14024E337B85</gtr:id><gtr:title>Role of qualitative research to inform design of epidemiological studies: A cohort study of mental health of migrants from the former Yugoslavia</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Mental Health</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/14ee5811e16436a7201e162511819771"><gtr:id>14ee5811e16436a7201e162511819771</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Djuretic T</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>k3vpfbbzTqa</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">G106/1212</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>3C193D18-12BD-4B15-8347-037BA623E0FF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mental Health</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>E4AF608A-CDB6-4CE6-AA10-95B3E043E22F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>8.1  Organisation and delivery of services</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
