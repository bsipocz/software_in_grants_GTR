rocks</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>NE/H021744/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Three thermally activated mechanisms are considered to be of particular relevance during slip in thermally unstable rocks such as carbonates: 1) flash heating at highly stressed frictional micro-contacts (asperities); 2) thermal pressurization of heated fluids released and/or trapped in the slip zone; and 3) the lubrication effects of nanoparticles produced by thermally-induced chemical decomposition reactions (decarbonation). In order to investigate whether such chemical and physical reactions in carbonate fault zones can make faults extremely weak and favour the continued propagation of earthquake ruptures, we propose here a multidisciplinary research program where mechanical, mineralogical, microstructural, fluid flow properties and modelling data, obtained from both field and laboratory studies are integrated. Fieldwork studies will be carried out in carbonate rocks from the Italian Apennines to reconstruct the natural fault zone geometries, identify the different structural domains and their associated fault rock assemblages. The integration of field observations and microstructural/mineralogical analyses will provide important geological constraints in the analysis and interpretation of the dominant deformation processes observed in experimentally deformed samples. These results will be used to produce a new classification scheme for seismic fault rocks in carbonates, based on the identification and description of diagnostic associations of fault rocks and microstructures which are indicators of earthquake slip events. This classification will aid in the recognition of fossil earthquakes along exposed fault segments and, therefore, can be used to interpret records of palaeo-seismic faulting in other parts of the world, aiding in risk/hazard assessment. High velocity friction experiments will be performed on solid and granular carbonate rocks, sheared at speeds similar to that seen in large earthquakes (1.3m/s), in order to assess the likely dynamic frictional strength Tf of fault rock materials collected from active fault zones in the study areas. Synthetic nano-powders obtained by thermal decomposition of carbonates in a furnace will also be tested. The integration of laboratory friction test results and microstructural studies from both experimental and natural faults should allow the identification of the dominant weakening mechanisms and constrain their operational conditions in natural environments. The permeability of granular materials is controlled by grain size distribution, grain shape, solid volume fraction and pore connectivity. All of these geometric parameters vary across a fault zone. Permeability laboratory measurements will be performed on field samples collected along transects oriented orthogonal and parallel to principal slip surfaces in the fault zones. These data can provide useful 'snapshot' information on the evolution of permeability of slip zones under known/controlled conditions (friction, displacement, timing of fluid emissions), which can be used to calibrate/test fluid flow modelling results. We will use a state-of-the-art numerical model (name) to determine the permeability tensor for the range of geometric parameters obtained from quantitative microstructaral analyses. This numerical approach will allow us to explore systematic permeability variations in a way that cannot be achieved through laboratory experiments alone. The rate of dissipation of the fluids generated by thermal decomposition of the carbonate during slip will be quantified, allowing the role they play in fault zone lubrication to be determined.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>566830</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Parma</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Italy, Italian Republic</gtr:country><gtr:description>Grain size analyses of seismic faults</gtr:description><gtr:id>C57857C7-9CFC-478D-8CFB-AFD5473EC4C6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The collaboration with researchers at the University of Parma produced the following publication:

1) A distinct and measurable geochemical signature, associated with high temperature decarbonation processes, has been observed by the integration of microstructural/mineralogical observations and geochemical data from experimental faults, deformed at seismic conditions. We adopted a simple modelling approach to show that, during earthquake propagation in natural carbonate fault zones, the operation of the same processes observed in the laboratory can: a) release significant amounts of CO2, which are comparable to those released daily by deeper sources (e.g. mantle degassing); b) produce groundwater post-seismic geochemical signatures which can potentially be measured and monitored, depending on the volume and geochemical nature of the aquifers. Our approach and findings can be applied to develop monitoring strategies of spring waters in seismically active areas.
2) We addressed the unsolved paradox of seismic slip episodically occurring along shallow creeping faults in poorly lithified sediments, by investigating the mechanics of creeping faults and producing new documented geological evidence showing how coseismic rupturing overprints creep in near-surface conditions. Field observations from fault zones developed in shallow, poorly lithified sediments show that foliated cataclasites (creeping behaviour) are locally overprinted by sharp slip surfaces decorated by thin black gouge layers. Compared to foliated cataclasites, black gouges have much lower grain size, porosity, and permeability. Moreover, they are characterized by distinct mineralogical assemblages compatible with high temperatures due to frictional heating produced during seismic slip. Foliated cataclasites were also produced
by laboratory experiments performed on host sediments at subseismic slip rates (=0.1 m/s), as well as black gouges produced only during experiments performed at seismic (1 m/s) slip rates. Our results show that black gouges represent a potential diagnostic marker for seismic faulting in shallow creeping faults. These findings can help understanding the time-space partitioning between aseismic and seismic behaviour of faults at shallow crustal levels, including tsunamogenic ones.
3) Superplasticity has long been postulated and recently observed for a range of metals, ceramics and nano-phase alloys deforming at high temperatures and range of strain rates. It has been inferred to occur at lower strain rates and high temperatures in geological materials typical of shear zones in the mid-lower crust and upper mantle. However, it has never been associated with earthquakes propagating in the upper crust, nor has it ever been recognized in the fault rocks of active, seismic faults. Our research shows new microstructural observations from experimental and natural carbonate rocks showing that nanoscale superplastic behaviour in geological materials is triggered in ultrafine grained, frictionally heated fault gouges during earthquake slip. We show that modelled flow stress values, obtained using superplasticity constitutive laws for carbonates at our experimental conditions, match those values we measured in the laboratory. Our findings show that nanoscale superplastic behavior may represent a new mechanism to explain the self-lubrication of faults during earthquake propagation in nature. This is a completely new discovery.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings are summarised in our publications and can be used by a broad range of scientists, including geologists, seismologists, geophysicists, experimentalists and material scientists, to improve our understanding of earthquake propagation processes. They may have obvious long term implications in terms of hazard and risk issues associated with such destructive, but still poorly understood phenomena. audience .</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>96CD1DCA-470E-4D88-B058-7535E4D8E60C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-5841711746.3813287793299a</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Education,Energy,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>NERC Knowledge Exchange Advisory Board appointment (Co-I Prof. Robert Holdsworth)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6B79504F-1C83-492B-A638-979C9F7ED9D2</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546382c6751cc8.15126075</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Expert Panel in Seismic Hazard and Climate Change appointment</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A0B35C98-07F4-408E-9B2B-443AD17E69B7</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54637c4815a107.85064033</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>About 400 friction experiments have been performed during this project in the Rock Mechanics Laboratory, using a low to high velocity rotary shear apparatus.
