After birth, the mature lungs are completely responsible for obtaining all the oxygen that we need from the air that we breathe. However, the correct functioning of the lungs may be seriously affected if there is a problem with normal lung development in the womb. Such problems might occur if a baby is born too early or if there is a malformation of the chest cavity. In both circumstances the ability of the lungs to take up enough oxygen is reduced. Very recently we have shown that in the womb lungs have a sensor molecule which can detect very small changes in the amounts of certain chemicals within the lung itself or within the blood supply to the lung. This suggests to us that this sensor molecule might control how the lung grows and also that problems with this sensor might lead to disease. To test this suggestion, we will breed mice which do not have this sensing molecule and study how the lungs grow in these animals. Next, we will study how the sensor actually works in the lung and will find out what happens when this sensor is prevented from working using a new set of drugs that we recently been given by a pharmaceutical company. These experiments will give us a greater understanding of how lungs grow, will help us to define how this important sensing molecule works and should lead to the possibility of treating people whose lungs have failed to develop correctly in the womb.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Embryonic lung development is tightly controlled and requires the integration of a variety of growth factors. Although the mechanisms driving lung morphogenesis are intrinsic, extrinsic factors, which are present in utero and that change dramatically at birth (e.g. oxygen and pressure), have profound influence on this developmental programme. Plasma calcium is one such factor which changes at birth but its role in lung development is unknown. In many tissues, extracellular calcium exerts its effects via stimulation of a specific G protein-coupled receptor. This protein is known as the extracellular Calcium-sensing Receptor, CaR. We now have exciting evidence to show that CaR has a narrow window of expression in embryonic mouse lung (E11.5-E16), which coincides with the stage at which branching morphogenesis takes place. Further, we have shown that branching is exquisitely sensitive to changes in extracellular calcium, and that pharmacological agonists of CaR mimic the inhibitory effect of high calcium on branching whilst CaR antagonists partly reverse this inhibition. Based on these data, we hypothesize that extracellular calcium, acting through the CaR, is an important extrinsic factor which modulates the intrinsic lung developmental programme. We will employ three approaches to test this hypothesis. Firstly, comparisons of lung phenotype will be made between CaR wild-type, heterozygous and homozygous mice. Secondly, the effects of specific CaR manipulation in wild-type animals will be probed using pharmacological modulators of CaR function in the lung branching morphogenesis model. Finally, functional consequences of CaR manipulation will be assessed electrophysiologically by measuring transepithelial potential difference in the lung explants from the three cohorts of mice. These experiments will define the role of CaR in lung development and should lead to the possibility of treating diseases characterized by hypoplastic lungs.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>393019</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>We have already made the breakthrough discovery that calcium ions, acting on a developmentally regulated calcium-sensing receptor, profoundly affect lung development and function. We are on target to complete the work for December 2009, with only the gene expression profiling to complete. 
The work so far has been published in the Journal of Physiology, Physiology News and another manuscript containing the full characterisation of a murine model lacking the calcium-sensing receptor is ready to be submitted (see Appendix 5). The initial publications have attracted major interest from the national and international scientific communities and by the general press. We have worked together with Dr Mendoza at the BBSRC media office and the Cardiff University press office, and have given several interviews on radio, local and national newspapers. A full page article appeared on the BBC News Website (http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7780158.stm) and many other international web sites, and an article describing our discoveries appeared in The Times. The press release also contained a quote from the BBSRC Director &amp;quot;Professor Janet Allen, BBSRC Director of Research said: &amp;quot;It is exciting to see that BBSRC-funded research has the potential to improve the lives of thousands of very premature babies. These scientists have shown that by first asking questions about a fundamental biological process, the possibilities for understanding and treating devastating human disease can then be thrown wide open. This demonstrates the value of basic research in biology for delivering real life impact.&amp;quot; Our initial scientific article was published in the Journal of Physiology, accompanied by a &amp;quot;Perspective&amp;quot; and full coverage on the cover of the Journal (see the December 15th 2008 issue). The article was recommended by the Faculty of 1000 Biology in February 2009 (http://www.f1000biology.com/article/id/1147467). 
In addition, experiments performed during the tenure of this grant have allowed us to set the basis for another grant application to Asthma UK and to BBSRC Sparking Impact Award which has led us to the singificant breakthrough of a novel therapeutic for certain lund diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We are now in the process of raising funding for the commercialisation of this idea. The basic science questions addressed by this project have led to a greater understanding of fetal lung development and to a novel potential treatment for asthma, which affect 10% of the population (asthma) and for COPD, which affects 1:4 people over the age of 50 and is predicted to be &amp;quot;the leading cause of death by 2020&amp;quot; (WHO).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>D031A56D-8C49-4A8E-82DA-B5AFA745C5D7</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5464840114f234.73190380</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>A baby's lungs grow steadily throughout pregnancy until they are almost fully formed by the time it is born.
