The poetry of the Maitland Quarto is presently only available in an out-of-print Scottish Text Society volume of 1920 by W.A. Craigie, which is a combination of a diplomatic and facsimile edition with sparse introduction, incomplete textual notes and glossary. The only edition of Maitland's poems is that of Joseph Bain, published in a limited run for the Maitland Club in 1831 (also out of print). Only a small number of the Quarto's texts appear in modern anthologies of Scottish verse. \nThe Quarto contains ninety-five poems. Amongst these it preserves all but one of the poems attributed to Sir Richard Maitland of Lethington (c.1496-1586), in contemporary sources, forty-four in total. Maitland was one of the most prolific writers and most distinctive poetic voices of the reigns of Mary Queen of Scots and James VI. His poems are of interest because of their topical nature, and because they reflect the literary influences, fashions and concerns of writers of the third quarter of the sixteenth century. They also evidence the circulation of, and interest in, the works of important Scottish poets of the first half of the sixteenth-century, especially William Dunbar and David Lyndsay. A number of Maitland's poems have considerable literary merit and innovativeness and have attracted attention from leading critics (most notably, Professor Alasdair MacDonald), yet remain inaccessible for most students and scholars. A new edition of the Maitland Quarto would provide access to the virtually complete corpus of Maitland's poems. No other source permits this. \nThe Quarto also contains works by John Maitland, Alexander Arbuthnot, Alexander Montgomerie, and Thomas and Robert Hudson (which are found only here or in the Maitland Folio). In addition, the manuscript contains thirty-eight unattributed poems. Most of these anonymous poems are unique, or attested only in a small number of other sources, such as London, Society of Antiquaries MS 87. The Maitland Quarto is therefore highly significant in revealing much about developments in Scottish literary culture in the second half of the sixteenth century, particularly in the neglected period c. 1550-1586, which has been often overlooked in favour of the 'golden age' of Scottish poetry in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries and the flourishing of literature at James VI's court in the late 1580s and 1590s.The Quarto includes translations from French, and poems with likely, but as yet untraced, continental sources. Its synthesis of elegies, epitaphs, friendship poems, and Sapphic verse, and an early example of 'the country house poem' (perhaps the earliest British example), make it an unusually diverse collection of sixteenth-century verse. This new edition of the Quarto Manuscript will provide access to, and full contextualization of, these texts. \nThe project is conducted according to current principles of textual scholarship. It involves making a full transcription of the manuscript (from microfilm and the original document) and the annotation of all poems through the provision of textual notes (collating readings from other witnesses) and explantory notes, glossary, critical introduction and bibliography. \nThis edition is currently under contract with the Scottish Text Society (to be published for the Society by the major academic publisher, Boydell and Brewer) for publication in 2013.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The edition is of interest not just to scholars and researchers, but also to non-academic beneficiaries. The following groups will benefit from this research:\n\n1. The wider public in the UK with an interest in Scottish literature, in particular teachers and school-age readers engaging with this subject in Scotland, and those interested in the local history and literature of East Lothian.\n2. The wider public in North America and Australasia, especially in view of the interest in Scottish culture and family and regional history amongst the Scottish Diaspora. \n\nThe impact of this research lies in its potential to increase public engagement with academic research and to enhance the cultural enrichment of the above groups, through extending their knowledge and contributing to their quality of life. \n\nPotential for impact will be maximised in the following ways: \n1.I intend to reach audiences outside the academy by writing an article on the significance of women and the family in the compilation of the Maitland Quarto for the online 'The Bottle Imp' ezine, which promotes the study and teaching of Scottish literature and language. I will submit this article in July 2012.\n2. The Scottish Text Society, the publisher for the edition, is a learned society which reaches audiences all over the world, both within and outwith the academy, through its publications, through public lectures, and through its presence at events such as the ESSE Conference and Edinburgh International Book Festival, and its online presence (on its website, through its newsletter, and Facebook). It regularly collaborates with other organisations such as the National Library of Scotland and Association of Scottish Literary Studies which have extensive public educational remits. The edition will be publicised to those with a general interest in Scottish literature and culture through the activities of the Society and its collaborators. The Scottish Text Society supports its editors in the organisation of public events and I am in discussion with it to organise a local public lecture on the Maitland family's manuscripts to coincide with the publication of the edition in 2013.\n3. The Scottish Text Society is currently working on plans to make some editions, or scholarship related to its editions, available electronically via subscription databases. I am keen to work with the Scottish Text Society and Boydell and Brewer to maximise the opportunities for my edition, or materials from it, to be made more widely accessible in this way. \n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-02-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-01-23</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>56402</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The Maitland Family in Haddington</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F7E01A3E-1285-4C63-9FE4-79B258593D4C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The talk was organised to coincide with the publication of the Maitland Quarto: An Edition (Boydell and Brewer) and took place on 25 October 2015 in St Mary's Kirk, Haddington.

This research project has resulted in the first critical edition of the Maitland Quarto Manuscript (c. 1586), a significant collection of Older Scots poetry. The edition (in two volumes) provides accurate texts of all poems in the manuscript and a full interpretive apparatus for them. It thus makes accessible a large number of little-known but historically and culturally important texts, facilitating future work on sixteenth-century Scottish literature, and contributing to critical debates on the nature of the canon of Older Scots poetry and its relationship to contemporary writing in England and on the continent. The edition also provides new research on the nature and compilation of an important Scottish manuscript anthology and thus contributes to the understanding of book history in the early modern period. It is contracted to the Scottish Text Society to be published by Boydell and Brewer in 2014. It is currently submitted for the final stage of peer review before publication. 

The major findings of the research project have concerned the authorship, contexts, and sources of poems in the manuscript, and thus, more generally, developments in Scottish literature up to 1586. These findings are presented to the reader in the introduction to the edition (17, 000 words), and in detailed headnotes and commentary for each of the ninety-five poems in the manuscript. The major findings for the project include:

? New evidence of the dating of the poems of Richard Maitland of Lethington and John Maitland, through careful analysis of their references to contemporary events and individuals.

? Analysis of the topical poems in the collection, which has revealed the full extent of the chronological, as well as and thematic, patterns of arrangement throughout the manuscript, both for attributed and anonymous works. In particular, this work has revealed a clustering of topical works and works of significance to the family concerning the years 1571-73, during which time the Maitlands experienced political and personal crisis as a consequence of Scotland's civil war (1567-73). This analysis has also given scholars a clearer indication of the dates of Richard Maitland's poetic career, which can be shown to span the years between c.1555 and 1573.

? The explication of the sources and analogues for all poems in the manuscript, demonstrating the range of texts, Scottish, English, French and Italian, available to Maitland writers. For example, I have identified printed English sources for a pair of short poems in the manuscript (MQ 87); and illuminated the relationship between one significant poem in the Quarto and an English manuscript copy (MQ 60). My source study has revealed the ongoing importance of earlier Scottish writers, such as William Dunbar, to late sixteenth-century poets in the wider Maitland circle (MQ 35, MQ 69 and MQ 94). It has also confirmed the influence of reformist literature such as psalm paraphrase and contrafactum, and The Gude and Godlie Ballatis (printed 1565, 1578) on their work (for example, MQ 37). 

? The identification of close verbal and source relationships between anonymous poems (for example the love poems 38 and 39, and penitential works MQ 73 and MQ 81) in the collection, which suggests shared authorship or a close-knit coterie of poets.

? The significance of one of the named poets in the collection, Alexander Arbuthnot. I have confirmed the hitherto uncertain attribution for one of his poems (MQ 37); posited an extension to his known oeuvre (for example, MQ 46 and MQ 47); and suggested that his poems influenced other writers in the Maitland circle, whose works are contained in the manuscript (for example, MQ 65), and that they may have been more widely circulated than their survival only in Maitland sources suggests. This, in turn, suggests that the Maitland network of readers and poets tolerated more radical protestant views than has been hitherto thought and provides additional evidence of their close associates in religious, intellectual and administrative circles. 

? New insights into the relationship between the Maitland Quarto and related manuscript witnesses, showing in particular that the scribe of the Quarto often elected to correct and in some cases update the Maitland Folio (for example modernising diction in MQ 44, MQ 51 and MQ 53), one of his copy texts, whilst also standardising the form of attribution for poems.

? New insights into the intended function of the anthology. While it has been previously recognised that the Maitland Quarto is a commemorative volume compiled around the time of Richard Maitland's death, close literary analysis of poems in the collection suggest that it was also designed as a celebration of other family events, and a reassertion of Maitland identity and importance at the beginning of the personal rule of James VI. My research into the forms of attribution for named poets in the manuscript also suggests the intimacy of the audience for which it was designed.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This research can be used in a non-academic context to encourage the engagement of new audiences in Scottish culture, and in the history of book owning, writing and reading in family contexts more generally. The edition, with its full glossary and comprehensive introduction and notes, is intended to be accessible to scholars, students and general readers of Scottish literature and those coming to Older Scots verse from other disciplines and backgrounds. However, I have also planned impact activities for the year of publication (see grant application) in order to enhance the impact potential of the edition by reaching out to new audiences. These activities are aimed at the non-academic beneficiaries of my research, especially teachers and pupils of Scottish literature at secondary-school level and those interested in Scottish writing and regional cultural heritage; and the wider public in North America and Australasia, especially in view of the interest in Scottish culture and family and regional history amongst the Scottish Diaspora. An e-zine article (2500 words) on 'Women as Readers and Writers in Early Modern Scotland: the Maitland Circle', has been submitted to The Bottle Imp (Association of Scottish Literary Studies, free access at http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/ScotLit/ASLS/SWE/TBI/Contact.html ) in July 2013 for publication in November 2013. This e-zine is designed to support the teaching and engagement with Scottish culture outwith university contexts. My article is aimed in particular at engaging those with a general or educational interest in Scottish Studies, and in the historical experience of women and families in book ownership, reading and writing. It focuses on a discussion of a short poem on female book ownership in the Maitland Quarto manuscript, and introduces readers to the process of editing and researching a family collection of poetry from the sixteenth century. The freely accessible project website (http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/crlc/research-projects/index.aspx) currently presents sample material (edited texts with introduction, headnotes, and commentary) from the edition and a summary of my findings, and is aimed at those with a scholarly or general interest in regional literature and culture both in the UK and beyond. I am currently in discussion with the Scottish Text Society about further e-publishing possibilities for the edition which will make longer sections from it available to an international audience both within and beyond academic contexts.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>7310DC87-A75F-4993-8486-48849A50015A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-3160132964.290802777fdd18</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/crlc/research-projects/index.aspx</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>259B03A7-63B9-42E0-AB1E-781AE93DB84E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Alexander Arbuthnot and the Lyric in Post-Reformation Scotland</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Studies in Scottish Literature</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d6d1fceac7f2234b65d6926119b83087"><gtr:id>d6d1fceac7f2234b65d6926119b83087</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Martin, Joanna M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58bec3a88d5fc3.33299945</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>411A7735-303A-45D4-89F3-6A9AE5A8FD42</gtr:id><gtr:title>'Women as Readers, Writers and Book Owners in Late Sixteenth-Century Scotland: The Maitland Quarto Manuscript', The Bottle Imp, 14 (2013), ISSN 1754-1514</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Bottle Imp, 14 (2013)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/061a84103c80bab901517af6df88c48e"><gtr:id>061a84103c80bab901517af6df88c48e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Joanna M Martin</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>54490750d47671.27192246</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4F7A40EE-794F-45CF-8C31-08A8629EC86A</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Maitland Quarto: An Edition</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/061a84103c80bab901517af6df88c48e"><gtr:id>061a84103c80bab901517af6df88c48e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Joanna M Martin</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>ISBN-10: 1897976402</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>5449067eb70e55.67917637</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I026057/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FB301405-099D-44B9-ADA9-75B11FDED8C0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>English Language &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
