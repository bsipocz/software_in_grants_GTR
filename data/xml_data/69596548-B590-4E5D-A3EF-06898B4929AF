Food</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/K030957/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Centre vision: The EPSRC Centre for Innovative Food Manufacturing will meet the challenges of UK and global food security through developing world-leading technologies, tools and leaders, tailored to the specific needs of food products.
With a turnover of &amp;pound;76.2bn (20% of the UK total), Food and drink is the largest manufacturing sector in the UK employing around 400,000 people. With an anticipated rapid growth in 'better value' products and in products designed for the nation's Health and Wellness, in particular for the ageing population, food manufacturing requires innovation in increased productivity - to produce more from less - to preserve natural resources such as water and energy, to minimise waste generation and to decrease the trade deficit in the sector. Crucially this will enable the UK food sector to be at the forefront of the next generation of sustainable production which are more natural and healthier., and to develop more resilient supply chains leading to state of the art manufacturing capability, in an increasingly competitive landscape.
The proposed research focuses on identifying not only new sources of raw material but also on reducing the demand on existing resources through a simultaneous improvement of food products, manufacturing methods and supply networks. In this context, some of the key research questions are: How do we fully valorise biomass (including waste re-use) as new sources of raw material in food production?; How can we design and manufacture products with the high nutritional values using fewer raw materials?; How do we improve the efficiency of food production processes (e.g. through smart monitoring technologies; process intensification / flexible manufacturing) to consume fewer resources (materials, energy and water) across the supply chain?; How can we eliminate the production and post-production waste caused by inefficient supply and manufacturing activities and /or relationships?
The scope of the proposed research focuse on the manufacturing activities from 'post-farm gate to supermarket shelf', and will be considered under two specific Grand Challenges (GC): 1) Innovative materials, products and processes and 2) Sustainable food supply and manufacture. These research challenges closely align with the EPSRC call for 'Centres for Innovative Manufacturing', in particular the three areas of Resource Efficiency in Manufacturing: processes and technologies towards complete reuse of key materials and components; the need to dramatically reduce energy demand, including the incorporation of smart energy monitoring and management technologies; optimisation of material and product re-use, re-manufacturing and recycling, Innovative Production Processes: manufactured foods being complex formulated systems, and Complex Multifunctional Products: food is a high volume product assembled using processes which operate from the nano- (raw material) to the macro-scales (packaged goods).
The proposed EPSRC Centre brings together world leading expertise in the areas of biomaterial science, formulation engineering and sustainable manufacturing. Loughborough and Nottingham are involved in the current EPSRC Centres and will ensure complementarities with other EPSRC research portfolios. The Centre will deliver demonstrable tools, methods and specific technologies, will develop academic and industrial leaders, and will provide evidence to support future policy making, thus ensuring the long-term competitiveness and security of the UK and global food supply chain. The proposal benefits from the interest and support of a wide range of stakeholders from ingredient producers and manufacturers to retailers and governmental organisations and has exploitation opportunities as the research challenges fit with the strategic themes in the new TSB High Value Manufacturing Strategy 2012-2015.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The Centre will cover the scientific and technological requirements of the food industry along the whole value chain from 'post-farm gate to supermarket shelf', requiring multi-disciplinary technical input from process engineering, chemical engineering, material science, food science, microbiology and toxicology, life cycle analysis, ICT and advanced manufacturing, thus impact will span the manufacturing paradigm from the technology / process level through to production and supply chain level. The scope of impact provides a challenge and a great opportunity to engender vision in the UK science base and to improve uptake and recognition in the industry.
The connection to industry through support, involvement in the advisory board and links to SME networks, through an interaction with the Manufacturing Technology Centre and clear alignment with the TSB High Value Manufacturing Strategy 2012-2015 will provide exploitation routes for the developments within the Centre. This should provide funding routes for sustainability beyond the first 5 years EPSRC funding.
Activity at the interface of disciplines will enable ground breaking publications in leading journals, which focus on specific areas of the food industry (e.g. Food Engineering, Food Hydrocolloids, J of Food Manufacturing Efficiency), and will provide cross-sector dissemination opportunities in (e.g Soft Matter, Langmuir, The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, Journal of Manufacturing Processes) along with invitations for keynote addresses.
Interaction and involvement with the National Technology Platform, KTN, FDF, ETP Food for Life and KIC Foodbest will provide influence, through delivery, into policy setting for future funding opportunities in the UK and across Europe.
The UK will benefit from the outputs of the Centre through an increase in productivity and efficiencies, a decrease in resource need (energy, water and raw materials) and the provision healthier, wholesome foods to achieve positive healthcare outcomes for the population, thus having impact on Food Security and Sustainability.
As the Centre begins to progress the areas of research equipment suppliers will be invited to become involved. We will host equipment for proof-of-principle, allowing equipment suppliers to design new versions of equipment to suit the developing targets, instead of manufacturing being constrained by what is already present. While developments in automation infrastructure will not be the focus of the Centre, developments in Eco-food production research theme can be shared with the Food Manufacturing Engineering Group. Innovation in production of healthy foods can drive inputs into the Rowett Institute and Institute of Food Research studies on human nutrition, while development of technologies for SME organisations can be translated through collaboration with Leatherhead Food Research and Campden BRI. Progress in the producing new, natural materials could utilise collaboration with the scale-up opportunities at the BDC at York and the BEACON Biorefining CoE for Wales. Technologies developed within the activities of the Centre may become suitable for spin-out to parallel industries (pharmaceutical, cosmetics, paints and chemical) as we would look to spin-in technologies to enhance the capability of the food industry.

In creating such an innovative environment we hope to redress the flow of high quality researchers being lured to overseas competitors, and we aim to nurture the next generation thought leaders for the UK food industry by providing high quality science training. This will include experiment design and execution, writing and presenting skills, knowledge of ideation and new technology scouting, team working and researcher committee leadership opportunities. Business training will be given in accountability against targets set in personal development plans.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>4501049</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Quorn</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Catergorisation of food waste and to study different options to optimise the management of food waste.

Abstract: Global levels of food waste are attracting growing concern and require immediate action to mitigate their negative ecological and socio-economic ramifications. In the developed world, of the order of 20-40% of food waste is generated at the manufacturing stage of supply chains and is often managed in non-optimised ways leading to additional environmental impacts. This research describes a novel decision-support tool to enable food manufacturers to evaluate a range of waste management options and identify the most sustainable solution. A nine-stage qualitative evaluation tool is used in conjunction with a number of quantitative parameters to assess industrial food waste, which is then used to generate performance factors that enable the evaluation of economic, environmental and social implications of a range of food-waste management alternatives. The applicability of this process in a software-based decision-support tool is discussed in the context of two industrial case studies. the most significant outcome / impact of this activity?

Pickering Particles Prepared From Food Waste

Particulate emulsifiers as alternative to small molecular surfactants for stabilisation of emulsion interfaces have generated increasing interest in recent years in academia and industry as they impart excellent microstructure stability. Presently however, except for hydrophobic starches, a food ingredient of the particulate emulsifier type is not available. This may be due to the lack of design rules as well as the desire to not create artificial processed particles as a new food ingredient. For this reason, food particles already present in processed foods or particles generated from food waste appear more attractive. We have previously demonstrated that commercial cocoa particles act as particulate emulsifiers. An investigation into the underlying mechanism of this functionality has enabled us to identify further food ingredient particles with emulsifying ability as well as pathways for converting selected sources of food waste into particulate emulsifiers. One of the pathways includes hydrothermal treatment of lignin-rich particulate source material to concentrate the lignin on their surface imparting interfacial activity as we will evidence in our contribution.

Abstract
Particulate emulsifiers, an alternative to small molecular surfactants for stabilisation of emulsion interfaces, have generated increasing interest in recent years as they impart excellent microstructure stability. Presently, however, except for hydrophobic starches, a food ingredient of the particulate emulsifier type is not available. This may be due to the lack of design rules as well as the desire not to create artificial processed particles as a new food ingredient. For this reason, food particles already present in processed foods or particles generated from food waste appear more attractive. 
This paper reports on the functionality and functionalisation of spent coffee particles as an emulsifier for o/w and w/o emulsions, respectively. Spent coffee was chosen as candidate waste material as it naturally contains lignin, a chemical component imparting emulsifying ability. Ground spent coffee particles will be shown to stabilise o/w emulsions at 1:1 fraction of oil: water and a range of oil polarities. Albeit flocculated, these emulsions were shear stable. Hydrothermally treated particles stabilised w/o emulsions, due to the relocation of lignin trapped in the cell wall material onto the particle surface during treatment. These emulsions were also shear stable but showed a more complex impact of shear history on viscosity behaviour. In conclusion, particulate emulsifiers for versatile application can be created from spent coffee. Transferability of this finding to other sources of lignin-rich food waste remains to be investigated.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>589d8f43c2fe77.58856625</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>IFST Food Sustainability Conference - Waste not want not attended by Jade Phillips and Pedro Gimenez from the CIM</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>364250DD-39AE-43B7-97D2-441D4E07B6B5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>CIM members attended the conference on the basis of gathering information regarding to statistics and current methods of improving food and industrial waste within the UK and other developing countries.

Abstract
Cellulose as an edible ingredient for 3D Printing.
Cellulose is the most abundant polymer in nature, providing structure to plant cell walls. It is therefore consumed regularly in the diet, not contributing any calorific value but acting as a natural dietary fiber. Its use as an ingredient, however, is somewhat limited to 'filler' type roles or as a bulking agent as good solvents are not suitable for food use. Mechanical abrasion by ball milling can render an amorphous powder which, when the recrystallisation kinetics are known, may be utilized in a Binder Jetting 3D process to create edible cellulose-based structures.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>589dd16fcc39b1.48368561</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://3dfoodprintingconference.com/2016-2/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Food Matter Live 2016 - Conference delegate Jamie Stone</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>07730A63-B060-473B-A5A3-38D089B80864</gtr:id><gtr:impact>CIM members attended visit to the research organisation which sparked questions and discussions afterwards, and increased interest related subject areas.

Modelling, Monitoring and Management of Water Consumption in Food Manufacture.
The true cost of water to manufacturers can be up to three times supply and effluent charges. In addition water shortages, lack of water company treatment capacity and ever changing legislation are business risks. In mitigation forward thinking companies will implement a water management policy, but long term sustainable reductions in water and effluent in manufacturing can only be achieved by understanding and addressing water use by individual process steps, on which there is rarely substantial operational or engineering data. To overcome this lack, Loughborough University is developing a set of flexible, non-invasive water analysis instrumentation to monitor in-plant effluent flows. The data obtained will be used in a previously developed Water Management Framework to identify hotspots for process or product redesign to improve water sustainability.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58a1b05d7cceb1.85238204</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.sustainablefoodexpo.com/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Sutton Trust Summer School  Workshop, July 2016 -  CIM team Jo Gould, Michelle Neville, Jade Phillips, Steve Johnson and Vincenzo diBari</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C6005CCA-2C8A-4C18-877A-961DA99B7729</gtr:id><gtr:impact>CIM members attended the Workshop which sparked questions and discussions during and afterwards, and increased interest related subject areas.

Clean labels are more important than ever to consumers with a recent survey finding that 58% of people would switch brands for an alternative without artificial ingredients. With this in mind, there has been an increasing interest into alternative, natural and sustainable food additives to replace artificial stabilisers and emulsifiers. For aerated food products surfactants and proteins are commonly used to reduce the surface tension at an air/water interface to infer stability. 

In this contribution we will introduce two alternative novel foam stabilisers. Firstly, low fat cocoa particles acting as natural Pickering particles capable of stabilising aqueous foams. We will also present how that these particles are also amenable to stabilising food foams such as cake and ice cream while removing added fat or egg from the ingredient list. Our second example looks towards the extraction of protein from insects rather than using whey proteins as a source of protein for foam stabilisation.

Effects of Ball Milling on the Selected Properties of High Protein Oat Bran Powder and Slurry
This study aims to evaluate the selected properties of high protein oat bran (HPOB) powder and slurry, i.e. particle size distribution, chemical, thermal, and rheological properties, as affected by different speeds of ball milling. The medians of particle sizes decreased from 128.4 &amp;micro;m to 37.76, 12.48, and 7.20 &amp;micro;m after ball milling at 300, 500, and 800 rpm respectively. Particle size distribution curve altered from nearly unimodal into multimodal with a broader size range. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectra showed a peak intensity increase in protein associated bands of ball milled HPOB. Gaussian curve fitting of amide I spectra region showed an escalation of random coil protein secondary structure as the beta-sheet structure declined, which confirmed protein denaturation. Contrariwise, a weaker peak intensity in carbohydrate associated bands indicated the loss of crystallinity. Scanning calorimetric studies revealed a reduced protein thermal stability of ball milled HPOB, shown by increment on heat capacity and shifting on onset and melting temperatures. Disruptive effects of ball milling significantly lowered the storage and loss modulus of HPOB slurry.

Drying of foods
Drying of foods is one of the most common preservation processes, since the removal of water inhibits microorganisms' growth and, therefore, prolongs the product shelf life. Since traditional drying techniques show long processing times and change in food characteristics, osmotic dehydration pre-treatment can be applied in order to produce an intermediate moisture product and, therefore, to improve the drying process. In this work, the influence of osmotic dehydration on oven drying and freeze drying performance in terms of product moisture content, water activity, rehydration ability and properties retention was investigated.

The most significant outcome was a fruitful discussion about the research with other postdocs and academics.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58a56fe5c8d088.05197822</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/university/colleges/eps/events/2016/College-of-Engineering-and-Physical-Sciences-Research-Conference-internal-event.aspx</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>AgroCycle workshop: Barriers and Opportunities to Valorising Agri-food wastes, co products and by-products (AWCBs) Brussels, 26 Jan 2017 attended by CIM member Guillermo Garcia-Garcia</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A4DD6717-5EE2-4234-8E61-D0C14A8A6D23</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Round table discussions and presentations, Learn about projects and partners in Europe looking into valorization of food waste.

Title of presentation and abstract from Pedro Gimenez CIM team member 'Distributed and Localised Manufacture of Food Products'
Abstract:
There is a need for a shift towards smaller-scale local manufacturing which has been highlighted by a range of factors such as changes in transport and labour costs, the availability and access to materials, energy and water; and the need for long-term resilience to market changes. The term 'distributed and localised manufacturing' (DLM) refers to a conglomerate of distributed and autonomous food production units which operate as a set of cooperating entities. The unique attributes of food products make them particularly suitable for localised, distributed manufacturing as they require a consideration of factors such as the need for fresh perishable ingredients, stringent storage and health risks associated with inappropriate distribution together with short post-production shelf-lives.
This research aims to develop a number of DLM models, tailored to specific characteristics of food groups, and the understanding of particular attributes that make a food product suitable for one of these DLM models. Furthermore, simulation-based decision support tools will be developed to allow 'what-if' scenario planning to assess the feasibility and viability, in addition of supporting the implementation of new DLM models. 
The expected benefits from this research will include the ability to facilitate the provision of customised/personalised food products in support of dietary requirements, creation of more agile and shorter supply chains, minimisation of the environmental impact and cost associated with food transportation, reduction in the risk and cost of recovery from major failures occurring in a single production line, and support of local economies.

This activity helped dissemination of the CIM research activities and also helped to the cohort of researchers to gain knowledge from experienced academics and industrialist. It also helped to network with industrial partners and to gather their ideas on our research activities from different perspectives.


This conference gave the opportunity for CIM team members to present their research to both academia and food industry and to receive constructive feedback from them on their research.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58a42c14c594e1.17135316</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.manufacturingfoodfutures.com</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Internal discussion on Extraction of valuable compounds from food waste using super critical CO2 technologies</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CCDB6E5B-491B-4A25-8D2B-4B6DFF54C73E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Jamie &amp;amp; Guillermo talked with the Food-CIM researchers Mattia and Vincenzo on possibilities to collaborate in a project to extract valuable compounds from food waste using super critical CO2 technology.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cb1e3e54d150.94797824</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Global Conference in Sustainable Manufacturing, South Africa. 3-5 October 2016 - CIM team member Guillermo Garcia-Garcia attended the Conference as a speaker</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>499749AB-F779-4F4E-B0AC-E5F5C5D77BAE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Title of Conference paper presented in the 12th paper session 'Optimization' on Tuesday 4th October.

Title: Optimising industrial food waste management
Abstract: Global levels of food waste are attracting growing concern and require immediate action to mitigate their negative ecological and socio-economic ramifications. In the developed world, of the order of 20-40% of food waste is generated at the manufacturing stage of supply chains and is often managed in non-optimised ways leading to additional environmental impacts. This research describes a novel decision-support tool to enable food manufacturers to evaluate a range of waste management options and identify the most sustainable solution. A nine-stage qualitative evaluation tool is used in conjunction with a number of quantitative parameters to assess industrial food waste, which is then used to generate performance factors that enable the evaluation of economic, environmental and social implications of a range of food-waste management alternatives. The applicability of this process in a software-based decision-support tool is discussed in the context of two industrial case studies. 

Guillermo promoted his research in front of a large academic and industrial audience and had the opportunity to network during three days with academics from all over the world. Guillermo learnt about different areas of sustainability from other presentations given. He visited the Stellenbosch Technology Centre and the company Polyoak and learnt a lot about manufacturing processes and management. 

The most significant outcome / impact of this activity for Guillermo was to promote his research, networking, learn from other researchers' work and from the visits.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58a4235a9994a6.91179081</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.gcsm.eu/SouthAfrica/index.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Showcasing the best of the City across all sectors with specific events on STEM, how brexit will affect science and technological transfer and also food sustainability. attended as delegate James Huscroft.</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0FFE9A0A-581B-46D5-8F3E-3AD0D072F238</gtr:id><gtr:impact>CIM members attended visit to the research organisation, which sparked questions and discussions afterwards, and increased interest related subject areas.

Title: Innovative Food Technology for RDM

Abstract:

The need for a shift towards smaller-scale local manufacturing has been highlighted by a range of factors such as changes in transport and labour costs, the availability and access to materials, energy and water; and the need for long-term resilience to market changes. The unique attributes of food products make them particularly suitable for localised, distributed manufacturing as they require considerations for fresh perishable ingredients, stringent storage and health risks associated with inappropriate distribution together with short post-production shelf-life. This project aims to develop an assessment framework based on 'product attributes versus market conditions', to highlight those food applications in which distributed manufacturing is economically feasible, environmentally beneficial, as well as having potential to support local economies. In addition a number of 'Distributed and Localised Food Manufacture' implementation models, tailored to specific characteristics of various food products categories, will be developed. These implementation models will form the foundations for a simulation-based decision support tool to allow 'what-if' scenario planning to assess their feasibility and viability. The expected outcome from the research will facilitate the provision of customised/personalised food products in support of dietary requirements, creation of more agile and shorter supply chains, minimisation of the environmental impact and the cost associated with food transportation.

Intact oil bodies can be extracted from oleaginous seeds and the sustainable processing of oilseeds can yield added value ingredients for the food industry. Projects at the Centre are examining the process of oil extraction and purification from oleaginous seeds. Understanding how extraction conditions relate to the quality of oleosomes will allow us to explore the functionality of these naturally emulsified structures for food applications.
A fundamental understanding of the food microstructure, such as foams and emulsions, will enable the design of stable food structures using more sustainable processes. At the Centre, we are using novel techniques to examine foam microstructures, particularly to understand foam drainage to improve foam storage. 
Emulsions are present in a large variety of food products, however many conventional processes require high levels of energy. Confined Impinging Jet Reactors (CIJR) is an innovative technology being developed at the centre. An advantage of this processing technology is the reduced energy required to achieve emulsification. 
Membrane emulsification is another technique that is used to produce emulsions with a narrow droplet-size distribution. The Centre is investigating the use of a rotating membrane to produce highly mono-disperse stable emulsions using food-grade particles.
The food sector needs to take into consideration its environmental impact in manufacturing and must not continue producing at the expense of the environment. 
An approach to reducing environmental impact is for manufacturers to consider the product design and process of manufacturing as a way of developing resilient supply chains. At the Centre we have generated a taxonomy that allows for resilience, whilst taking into account the shelf life and natural variability of materials and product. The Centre is partnering with industry to validate these measures for factory implementation. 
Another way to address environmental impact is to categorise and examine the factors contributing to food waste from production to end-product use. These are some of the projects that are being explored at the Centre to aid the reduction and improved utilisation of food waste. A significant cost to the food manufacturing sector is the large volumes of effluent generated. Our researchers have developed a non-invasive sensor which provides feedback on effluent to optimise treatment of water.
The changing consumer behaviours and development of new business operating models is indicating that more adaptable manufacturing is required in the future.
At the Centre, we are exploring the feasibility of food production in relation to distribution chains and food materials and manufacturing processes for distributed manufacturing.
Distributed manufacturing enables production of food to be closer to the point of use. Consumers can finish a product quickly before consuming to the same quality that would have otherwise been completed by the manufacturer. Through distributed manufacturing, the food waste generated is also reduced with extended product shelf life and increased storage stability.
Researchers at the Centre are developing a set of metrics to highlight areas where distributed and localised manufacturing may provide economic, environmental and social benefits. 
To improve the shelf life of perishables, a project being explored at the Centre specifically focuses on tomato structure. Cell wall remodeling normally occurs during the process of tomato fruit softening and by modifying cell wall genes expression during ripening the texture and therefore shelf life of the fruit may be altered. 
Other projects have focused on formulation and processing techniques that are relevant to the food sector. The team is developing new food formulations that can be dried for prolonged shelf life and rehydrated when required to achieve desirable organoleptic properties. 
Additive manufacturing of food can offer the food and drink industry a number of competitive advantages, including: Customisation, Structures with visual appeal, On-demand production, Utilisation of novel materials and Geometric complexity.
The Centre is exploring different methods of using edible materials for additive manufacturing. Our researchers are exploring Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) to process food grade biopolymers to create edible filaments. The properties of particular food grade materials are being explored to ascertain whether they are suitable as a printing medium. In addition, the research is exploring how different materials react throughout the printing process and if their properties are affected after the process.
Other research at the Centre has focused on using natural materials relevant to the food industry and Binder Jetting to create 3D printed materials with feature sizes of less than 100 &amp;micro;m. This produces structures with unique and interesting topographies. 
Combining a need to reduce food waste and to impact on a 'Circular Economy' for the food system strategies are required to provide sustainable solutions in getting more out of what nature provides. 
The Centre aims to challenge traditional food production by finding more efficient and effective uses of ingredients and food materials. 

To align with changing consumer lifestyles, the Centre is also exploring ways to meet demands to produce novel products for healthier diets using natural ingredients. Research at the Centre examines alternative sources to achieve traditional structures.
Some of our projects has been exploring food grade materials, such as protein-pectin complexes, bees wax and lignin-rich particles, derived from food waste, are able to form stable emulsions and foams. 
Projects utilising insect and plant-based proteins have proven to be sustainable, nutritious filler ingredients, to provide added functionality to food microstructure. The Centre is currently investigating potential replacements of undesirable solid fats in food products, such as cakes and pastries. Research projects are exploring the functionalities of a range of food hydrocolloids towards the design of healthier foods.
There is a considerable interest in improved delivery and controlled release of actives including tastants, minerals, vitamins, and probiotics. Our researchers are exploring processes to effectively deliver key nutrients for triggered release in the gastrointestinal tract. To improve delivery of such sensitive components, researchers are assessing the processing parameters of specific drying methods and their effects on the integrity of the encapsulated nutrient. In addition, biopolymer complexes have been examined and has demonstrated promising encapsulating potentials.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We have an industry members list of ~70 and are in dialogue with them about uptake of findings.
