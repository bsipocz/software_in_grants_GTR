&lt;/ol></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will benefit all stakeholders of the practice of HRM in organisations across all sectors in the UK and Hong Kong by better understanding the current activities HR practitioners are engaged in and what levels of influence they are able to yield within organisations. Stakeholders of HRM practice are: 

*the HR professional bodies
*HR practitioners
*students studying for professional membership
*other organisational stakeholders, including:
 -employers
 -other functional areas of management
 -employees
 -employee representatives (unions)

The status, activities and influence of HR practitioners is important as it has an impact on how people are managed and treated at work. It is widely recognised that all organisations that employ people perform HR activities, so the professional conduct of HR is important. This project will provide information on what HR practitioners are doing and what influence they have within organisations. It will also gain an insight into what agendas these practitioners are pursuing and the extent to which they are aligned to the most recent strategic direction being pursued by the professional bodies, as well as to founding professional principles which state the benefits for individual members (in terms of enhanced personal development), organisations (in terms of enhanced organisational performance) and society as a whole (in terms of the promotion of sustainable, progressive and ethical practices). These objectives are, themselves, closely aligned to the three strategic priorities of the ESRC.

While the stakeholders identified will benefit in different ways, the dissemination of findings from the project will enable enlightened debate among all of these on the future role of HR, the homogeneity of HR across countries and sectors, and the variety of workplace experiences of HR practitioners. One major contribution of the study will be its contribution to the development of professional HR practice in China, especially within the context of the Closer Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) between Hong Kong and China.

The professional bodies themselves will benefit most in terms of gaining an insight into how closely aligned the aspirations and values that they have for their members match their members' actual experiences and values. They, along with their members, could also benefit from the creation of a diagnostic tool - based upon the questionnaire survey used at stage 3 of the project - to assess membership profile against the membership standards. The methodological implications of this element of the study could also prove to be beneficial to other managerial professions keen to learn about the status of their members, while gaining further insights into HR's collaboration with other organisational actors.

Facilitation of greater bi-lateral understanding between the two institutes - which already have made steps to collaborate on employment relations and union management training - will also be a natural outcome of the study which will add a further dimension to extant &amp;quot;Next Generation HR&amp;quot; research.

The project should provide some benefit to any of the estimated 350,000 individual HR practitioners in the UK (LFS, 2007), in terms of a greater reflection upon their own career development in relation to the profession as a whole and where they may stand in relation to their broader career aspirations. Outputs of the project - where individual HR practitioners could benefit - include submissions to the CIPD conference and to HR practitioner-oriented publications (People Management, HR magazine).

Students of HRM - particularly those undertaking courses leading to professional qualifications - will gain both by learning about the role and diversity of HR standards in an East and West context and through the practical implications of the research such as improvements to academic course content, structure and application.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-21</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>76742</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD)</gtr:description><gtr:id>4591099A-D83A-4065-BAC9-7F2BA8A0F3D7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Formal presentation of provisional findings from HR practitioner survey to CIPD senior managers 17 April 2014.

The talk &amp;quot;Whiter the HR profession&amp;quot; provoked questions at the end, plus further questions after the event. The slides for the presentation were requested and now lodged with MIRS on their website.

Unprompted comments received after the event via email and via LinkedIn. One comment as follows:

I was at the meeting at Man Met last night 
 
Without appearing to grovel I enjoyed every minute. Mainly because the result of the survey confirmed every view I have had for years but I have always felt a lone voice surrounded by a far younger and different demography. I am a HR Employment Relations Consultant and Employment Law Advisor with advanced years disclosing my experience.
 
Lots of information delivered well. Your best message probably did not sink into the many students. Adapt your studies accordingly and do a bit of the hard work on the legal side. But that may be another cry in the wilderness.
 
After the creeping - the request. Is it possible to have a copy of your power point slides? I am getting the survey report but the slides would be fantastic.
 
Whatever the result - thank you, good luck in the future &amp;amp; GB</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>562f52ec3c5449.48230529</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.mirs.org.uk/meetings.php</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>UK Director's briefing of the survey findings was given to (predominantly) London-based HR leaders.</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A38E16F0-81A4-491E-8891-0F793FBA5730</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Sparked questions and discussion and potential participation at next stage.

Findings of the project have been presented to a number of practitioner and joint academic/practitioner audiences. The short term implications of these interventions are likely to limited. However, the implications of influencing thinking within - in particular - the professional bodies in the UK and in Hong Kong are likely to be longer term. The potential impacts on these bodies would be in the following:

*change to content of HR professional standards
*change to use in HR professional standards
*change to interpretation of HR professional behaviours

So far, influence on these issues has been tacit. Findings presented to practitioner audiences has highlighted the following issues for professional practice:

*the role of dealing with organisational conflict as a key resource-dependency issue at organisational level may be under-recognised within professional bodies at national level

*some core skills gaps remain a problem for practitioners - notably quantitative skills 

*the gender profile of the profession remains stubbornly imbalanced at senior levels

*the ethics dimension of HRM needs stronger support in desired knowledge standard

*comparatively, professional standards structuring demarcates into knowledge and behaviour profiles.

The configuration of international HRM dimension of the professional standards documentation differs between two major institutes. 

For both institutes, more content on ethics and integrity needs to be included in knowledge standard to make it consistent with behaviour standard. 

From the survey, the level of activity, in terms of the knowledge application of HR practitioners, is broadly in line with the parameters of the 'professional maps' provided by the respective professional bodies in Hong Kong and the UK. So greater expertise and discretion is deployed by those in more senior positions and those holding more senior professional membership status. There is, though, a 'bulge' of those holding a 'specialist' role seeming to be using more of their HR-specific skills and knowledge compared to both those in more junior 'transactional' roles (as might be expected) but also those in more strategic positions. 

Exploratory factor analysis of survey participants behaviour profiles provokes a strategic versus administration divide. The profession appears to be demarcated along these lines. 

Multiple regression analysis of survey respondents reveals that professional membership status is more predictive of knowledge profiling than behavior profiling where years HR experience and seniority play a greater role. 

Case study evidence suggests that some key attributes of what constitute 'professionalism' in HRM is not entirely in line with popular discourses from the profession itself. Proactive elements such as organisational development, while desirable, are not as valued as the knowledge and skills depended upon for issues of regulatory compliance and procedural justice within organisations. This has been consistent, with some important caveats, between Hong Kong and the UK, though stronger in the UK. Related to this is the role of ethical gatekeeper among more senior practitioners.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>To inform the professional bodies the levels of knowledge, skills and behaviour attributes, along all the professional standards categories, of existing practitioners.
