For the first time researchers can obtain large amounts of population data free of charge (so-called &amp;quot;open data&amp;quot;) thanks to government websites such as data.gov.uk. When these data are combined with the computing power to perform complex calculations it creates an unprecedented opportunity for social science researchers. We are now in an era of big data and this is fundamentally changing the research environment for investigations across social science.The purpose of this project is to develop some of the new perspectives required to adapt to these changes in the practice of data modeling and synthesis.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>These new perspectives include the need to account for the increased uncertainty in data provenance and less thorough metadata, as the data provision philosophy has shifted away from careful collection and dissemination to an emphasis on expediency. Researchers increasingly have to temper gains in data volume against losses in data quality when they embark on a study. Extra caution is also required when combining datasets, especially if they contain geographic information, as it is not always case that the spatial scales are compatible.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The proposed project will develop a web-based tool to help social scientists minimise or eradicate these issues by enabling the synthesis, mining and visualisation of open datasets in a more informed way. It will also use the newly combined data to undertake more complex analyses of population processes using supercomputers to gain unprecedented insights into social phenomena.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>1.1 THE ESRC
Influencing Behaviour and Informing Interventions: The project is about linkage and synthesis across a range of datasets from administrative, commercial and volunteered sources. The challenge associated with this is nontrivial and if successfully overcome it will have important impacts on the interaction of data between seemingly disparate sources. Additionally, the range of international partners selected in this project reflect expertise that will be important to UK social sciences. It is hoped that the outcomes from this project can help to inform future ESRC data strategy through the incorporation and development of the ADT findings at the start of the project through to the integration of datasets with the ESRC Data Service at the end. 
A Vibrant and Fair Society: The largest impact this project will have is the better use of data in the social sciences. By utilising new technologies, a number of high-impact data visualisations are envisaged which, will raise wider public awareness of society's inequalities. Wider outreach is detailed in the proposal, but much of it will be motivated by the development of a vibrant and fair society. 
1.2 ACADEMIC PARTNERS (UNIVERSITY OF ZURICH AND UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS)
I have expressed an interest in presenting my research at the departmental seminars at each of the universities I intend to visit to inspire further collaborations with world leading researchers. The ambition to co-author peer reviewed publications will also provide a lasting outcome from the relationship that, it is hoped will extend beyond the duration of the project. In addition collaborators will be able to utilise some of the carefully prepared datasets assembled thus expanding the applications and relevance of their own research. My work with the University of Illinois will, for example, help to build a compelling case for greater involvement of the social sciences in US cyberinfrastructure projects and this, in turn, will contribute to the case for continued funding of the host department, whilst my work with Zurich could link to a broader proposal to the European Science Foundation.
1.3 INDUSTRY
If investment in open data, especially from government sources, is to be sustained and justified there need to be tangible benefits beyond academic research. Through partnering with ESRI (UK) this project will help inform the company about both the possible value of open data (something they already have an awareness of) and best practice to unlock its potential. In addition I have agreed a series of industry workshops with the Open Data Institute (ODI) to showcase the data and tools created and compiled over the course of this project.
1.4 SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH
The ambition to publish not only provides a quantifiable method of demonstrating research output, it will also offer focus to the range of collaborations I plan to pursue. Work with the University of Illinois will yield a paper on the value of supercomputing to social science, with the University of Zurich a paper on using visual analytics to gauge the quality of open data in geography and with my academic mentor a wide ranging paper on flows in population data. I will aim for highly cited international and interdisciplinary journals and believe that the strength of the work I plan to undertake, combined with the interest in the topic, will facilitate this. 
1.5 POLICY
The proposed policy document will go some way to ensuring the promises of open data are realised by offering clear guidance and examples of best practice. The document itself is not meant to replace or override existing larger scale initiatives (such as the ADT); it merely seeks to contribute to the growing body of literature from the perspective of GIScience to better inform constructive access to open data.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>243145</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>London: Aspects of Change presentation</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DF10D83D-6A7E-4A08-86AD-F591DA32064B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation and panel as part of UCL's London: Aspects of Change event.

It is used throughout the public, private and charity sectors for data insights as well as by schools and universities as an educational resource. The website attracted over 100,000 users in its first 3 months of operation thanks to media coverage by the following outlets:
Guardian Online
Guardian Cities
City AM
Metro
Flowingdata.com

In the UK, outputs from my research are used widely to communicate complex social issues to their stakeholders and to inform policy. In addition, a key output - the Datashine.org.uk website - has been commended by the Royal Statistical Society in its &amp;quot;Data Manifesto&amp;quot; as an exemplary use of data to inform policy. Those using the research include:

2. Homelessness Link
3. London First
4. Blackpool Council
5. The Greater London Authority
6. The Airports Commission
7. MySociety

The above listed uses are specific examples of a wide and growing user base for the Datashine platform.

In addition to societal impact (detailed elsewhere on ResearchFish), it has led to new knowledge and enabled the PI to develop many of the skills required to become a &amp;quot;future research leader&amp;quot;. Thanks to BODMAs research there is now a greater understanding of the challenges and potential for the use of spatially-referenced open datasets in social science research. 

The project has provided the basis for new ways of representing geographical data - in particular how best to show different levels of uncertainty as well as multivariate data. As a result it has been foundational in the work of the ESRC Consumer Data Research Centre. There have also been a number of high profile collaborations with the likes of Nike and National Records of Scotland. This work has involved the use of innovative mapping and visualisation platforms developed as part of the BODMAS project. In addition, the PI has been called upon to provide advice to the governments of Taiwan and Japan on how best to maximise the value of open datasets in their respective countries.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The BODMAS project has developed a network of researchers interested in the use of the analysis and visualisation of open datasets in the social sciences.

The latest Open Data developments, covering policy, research and commercial applications will be addressed at the Summit.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5511553a7e6008.37615374</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in advisory committee</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.gov.uk/government/world-location-news/uk-open-data-mission-visits-taiwan</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>DataShine Listed by Bristol City Government as a good census visualisation tool</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B36A3C3C-4A4D-495C-9280-6272443B99A2</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d852e56df321.12652858</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.bristol.gov.uk/statistics-census-information/census-2011</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>National Records of Scotland: Report on non-EEA migrants to Scotland (cited)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>09CEE473-E434-4EF3-A529-DE60BE2A2022</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d86bda4a3a66.67232801</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://scotlandscensus.gov.uk/documents/analytical_reports/Migration_Matters_Scotland_Census2011_Statistical_Report.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Office for National Statistics Website Link for DataShine</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EF34F7D4-5AFE-4894-A972-F5D9BFAF131B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>55115904a6a648.56918984</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/analysis/external-links-to-census-analyses/index.html</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Most downloaded National Centre for Research Methods ePrint</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B7BE3BC1-4BD5-4B31-8D73-D00A89308118</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>55115b11c1bc01.38966140</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://eprints.ncrm.ac.uk/3295/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Meeting with Japanese Government CIO and National Strategy Office of ICT, to demonstrate our data visualisations</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A6773B6E-703E-423C-A4A0-296DD7BD0502</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d84d6b727058.03393422</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>London First - Opportunity Areas Report</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F7E9B804-A83C-4AA7-A059-FDFD15F5F14C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>55116654c80d08.05370546</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Cited as great resource by the Scottish Association of Geography Teachers (SAGTeach)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F22A60C6-B43A-4562-9CC2-46185A623725</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d5dd49e6ed71.44385302</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://twitter.com/SAGTeach/status/704429392349503488</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>DataShine Scotland maps the Census aggregated statistics - most &amp;quot;Quick Statistics&amp;quot; and some &amp;quot;Key Statistics&amp;quot; published by NRS for Scotland.
