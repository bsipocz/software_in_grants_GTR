These crops draw carbon from the atmosphere into their biomass and the soil during growth, so when they are utilised for energy generation, some or all of the resulting emissions have already been sequestered. Bioenergy offers the dual benefit of reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, whilst providing energy security through both direct electricity generation and liquid biofuels. As renewable energy targets increase, and interest in negative emissions technology (such as Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS)) increases, pressure on the land increases. Large amounts of land would need to be converted to meet these targets (approximately 7% total global land area, about the size of the USA, by 2050), resulting in potential negative environmental impacts, as well as potential competition for land with food. 

One option, which could alleviate this pressure on the land, is 'vertical farming'. Vertical farming allows crops to be grown in a vertical formation, for example in stacked crates, fitting much more crop per land area than is currently practiced. Vertical farming is attracting an increasing amount of attention for reducing the amount of land occupied by crops. At present, this method is only being applied to food crops, and little is known about its suitability for 2G bioenergy crops. This Fellowship will be the first research to assess the feasibility of vertical farming for 2G bioenergy. 

I will assess the current practice of vertical farming and design a bespoke system for 2G bioenergy crops, in collaboration with horticultural scientist from the University of California Davis and with engineers from the University of Southampton. Using techno-economic modelling, I will estimate the cost and environmental impact of using vertical farming bioenergy compared to traditional bioenergy cultivation. I will also review the how the Ecosystem Services from traditionally cultivated 2G bioenergy may be affected by cultivation using vertical farming. In consultation with Drax, the UKs largest bioenergy electricity producer, I will identify how vertical farming may impact their commercial operations. Using spatial modelling, I will identify where in the UK vertical farming bioenergy can be deployed, and the feasibility of deploying it with the negative emissions technology Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS). I will consider possible future land use in the UK, thinking beyond historical land management, to consider radical land use alternatives. Given contrasting geography, climate and political priorities, current and future land use is considerably different in the USA. I will work with scientists at the University of California Davis to ascertain how vertical farming bioenergy could be deployed in the USA. Finally, in consultation with the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), I will outline the policy innovations and regulatory environment necessary to facilitate the dissemination of vertical farming bioenergy, to maximise economic, social and environmental outcomes.

This research is the early stages of development and therefore falls within the Industrial Strategy's aim to invest in science, research and innovation. Should the technology prove viable, vertical farming bioenergy has the potential to deliver clean energy, improve security of supply and enhance the supply chain through reduced reliance on imports. There is the potential for inward investment in this innovative technology, and opportunities for export due to increased yields per unit land area. If coupled with BECCS, vertical farming bioenergy will promote local growth through training and jobs for local communities. This Fellowship will be the first step in translating world-class research into lucrative commercial outcomes.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>365527</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/R013314/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5B25B6A3-B218-4F11-8A9D-661236DF455C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agri-environmental science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>17F21DBC-4946-4262-AD07-9914F6EA12F7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Bioengineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>825466D8-66F3-4ABB-A62C-357225C4B154</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Terrest. &amp; freshwater environ.</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>794345CD-A1D5-4984-ADDD-088BCF41822F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agricultural systems</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>68D4AB6A-88C3-4368-8A94-2DADEEF21FF5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Bioenergy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E94BED75-343A-47C8-BEA1-E1E927732B34</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Land - Atmosphere Interactions</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
