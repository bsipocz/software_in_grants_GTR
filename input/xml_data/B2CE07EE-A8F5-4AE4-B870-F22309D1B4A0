All such circuits have been in III-V technology while over 98% of microelectronic sales are silicon devices. Previous work at Cambridge has demonstrated III-V type performance from Si/SiGe RTDs. This proposal is to develop and demonstrate basic circuits using Si/SiGe RTDs combined with strained-Si MOSFETs, a key step required if such technology is to make the leap to production. One application will be investigated as a demonstrator, that of tunnelling static random access memory (TSRAM). The TSRAM has the ability to be integrated with future CMOS microprocessors using strained-Si technology, hence the inclusion in the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) of RTD technology. In particular the TSRAM potentially offers 7 orders of magnitude improvement in CMOS SRAM standby power dissipation, now one of the most important parameters in the future scaling of CMOS microprocessors. We also propose to develop existing outreach teaching resources on Moore's law, scaling and post Moore devices to encourage children into science and the U.K. semiconductor industry linked to the proposed research.The work we propose is also aligned with the EPSRC Signposted Grand Challenges in Silicon Technology as set out by the U.K. EPSRC Silicon Futures network (GR/T07879). This particular proposal to some degree straddles all the Technology Grand Challenges but the change of device architecture to RTDs with ~2 nm critical dimensions is most strongly aligned to the G1: Novel Devices and Processes Using Silicon Based Technology. This proposal will develop and validate quantum device models of RTDs (G2.2) and use numerous characterisation techniques at the nm scale (G3). The RTD technology is using SiGe and so we are addressing G4: New Materials Systems for Silicon Based Technologies. As standby power dissipation is also reduced by 7 orders of magnitude compared to SRAM, this is also aligned with the G7 Eco-silicon Grand Challenge and the many potential applications for a successful technology especially with DAC and ADC circuits has strong associations with the G6 Silicon for Life Grand Challenge.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>118400</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>14th IEEE conference  International Conference on Nanotechnology (2014)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>90DDD714-6561-4330-9F81-5299608048A9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The talk generated useful discussions and interest from other researchers wanting to use the technique we developed

Other finding on tunnelling per se has been award to myself and Professor Mo Missous in Manchester with the result that we have, after
25 years of trying we have at last got a manufacturable process for growing the tunnel barriers and we are working to refine the device processing. Of itself this will lead to a major expansion of the capability of electronics over the 250-650GHz range which has been poorly served until now. A major 4-university consortium is bidding for a programme grant led from Manchester, with many supporting companies who are specifying their needs and providing over &amp;pound;1.5 of indirect support.
Dr Dingli Zuo refined his software development skills in the project and he has been recruited by Microsoft as a software system designer. All but one of my students have left for 'real world' appointments after graduating.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>881AD06F-CE90-4834-A123-B6AFDA05C25B</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d962d01fc579.80262194</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Electronics</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>I refer to the Cambridge-specific contribution to this project. We developed a simulation tool that allowed us to incorporate a range of key parameters for the values of the detailed current-voltage characteristics of the elements of a TSRAM cell, and from this infer the yield and reproducibility of TSRAM cells due to imperfections in the growth or processing of devices. The results was a clear set of tolerance rules for growth and processing, that would imply reaching a satisfactory yield in a manufacturing process.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This work helped MJK, working with Prof Mo Missous in Manchester, to drive forward a project, funded by a Royal Society Mercer award that has shown that the high yields in processed devices can be achieved, and commercialisation if simple tunnel devices is under way.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>DFDF1F82-3924-4AD8-BAB1-EC831C0F9C3E</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d9646b66f620.08637680</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Electronics,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>FE865D54-2B4B-4EC8-8012-A3696D885A12</gtr:id><gtr:title>Estimating and enhancing the yield of tunneling SRAM cells by simulation</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e1400f2d75c3a6b4917e60189499003a"><gtr:id>e1400f2d75c3a6b4917e60189499003a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Zuo D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-4577-1755-0</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>56e15f7d4c74a8.34617159</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B541F566-DD41-4FB6-8AEF-FBAB5865B2A0</gtr:id><gtr:title>Yield-driven design of tunnelling SRAM cells</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Electronics Letters</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e1400f2d75c3a6b4917e60189499003a"><gtr:id>e1400f2d75c3a6b4917e60189499003a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Zuo D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545b9228ef3a21.34150341</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>194251AF-E121-4184-B212-4C9CC22141F6</gtr:id><gtr:title>Estimating and enhancing the tolerance and yield for tunneling SRAM cells by simulation</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e1400f2d75c3a6b4917e60189499003a"><gtr:id>e1400f2d75c3a6b4917e60189499003a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Zuo D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-4244-7863-7</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>56e15ff99c4f51.70582990</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/G039089/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
