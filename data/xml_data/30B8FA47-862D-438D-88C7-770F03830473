At present, 5 programmes have been selected planned for the UK DRI at Imperial College London and with scientific and operational leadership provided by its associate director, Professor Paul Matthews. The project at Imperial College London will involve refurbishment of a floor in the new Michael Uren with space for 64+ researchers. An interim solution at the Burlington Danes facility at Hammersmith campus is being used before completion of the final location at the Michael Uren, ready for eventual occupancy by September 2019.

The approach of the institute as a whole, of which the UK DRI at Imperial College London forms a core part, is to amplify and enhance, not replace, current dementia research efforts in the UK. The UK DRI will help to cement the UK?s world-leading position by supplying vital new funding for research, coupled to promoting innovate approaches and forging much closer collaboration and integration of on-going UK research efforts. 

There is a gap in our knowledge of how the healthy brain functions and what leads to its degeneration. The UK DRI will fill this crucial gap that exists at the start of the dementia research journey. It will study the healthy brain and neurodegeneration in order to build new knowledge and understanding that will lead to new treatments. It will also proactively connect to existing clinical and population-level dementia initiatives ? for example as being undertaken by the MRC Dementias Platform UK and through the NIHR TRC-D ? to catalyse a unique national and strategic approach to confronting the dementia challenge.

In particular, the present research at the UK DRI at Imperial College London plans to look at the innovation theme, including: Individual variation in dementia within populations; Metabolic factors, microbiome and role of sleep; Glial-neuronal interactions; Novel bioelectronics technologies to modulate neurons and glia in sleep, neuroprotection and cognition Funding to these science programmes is provided separately.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>5300000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MC_PC_17114</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
