Engagement, inspiration and active learning are high priorities for museums and galleries, but methods for evaluating them often lack a sense of the richness of participants' experience. New approaches for evaluation of engagement are needed. In particular, more can be done to leverage the profound rethinking of place and space that has come along with digital incursions into our day-to-day lives. The problem to be addressed in this research is that the significance of 'place' - imagined and real - is not being built upon to inform the evaluation of engagement with cultural heritage. A theoretical perspective drawing on mobilities theory, which focuses on tracing trajectories, networks, and the movement of people and objects, will be used to reimagine arts evaluation. 

This project will develop, test and assess 'artcasting', a new digital and mobile form of evaluation of arts-based engagement, in the context of ARTIST ROOMS On Tour (AROT). ARTIST ROOMS is a collection of more than 725 works of international contemporary art acquired in 2008 by National Galleries of Scotland and Tate. It is being shared throughout the UK in a programme of exhibitions organised in collaboration with local galleries of all sizes. AROT aims to ensure the collection engages new, young audiences, and this will be mirrored in this project by a focus on young people (ages 13-25).

Artcasting involves the visitor in selecting an image of an artwork from a ROOM, and digitally 'casting' it outward to another location, where it can be received on mobile devices in the future (see visual evidence). The artwork will be linked with a significant place in the mind of the visitor, evoking memories and emotions, and supporting lasting learning. In addition, through brief stories visitors record about their choice of location, artcasting shows how the impact of an exhibition may be extended imaginatively and literally through space and time. Artcasting simultaneously encourages visitors to make connections and reflect on what they have experienced, and captures those connections for sharing, analysis and evaluation. In this way, it challenges dominant approaches that separate engagement from evaluation. 

The objectives of the project are to understand how mobilities approaches can enrich arts evaluation; to design, develop and pilot the artcasting platform; to generate a new approach to evaluation that can be built upon in the future; and to influence ARTIST ROOMS evaluation practice.

These objectives will be met through a three-stage research process involving qualitative methods and a design-based approach to generating, piloting and evaluating artcasting prototypes. Methods will include interviews, workshops with young visitors, iterative design of the artcasting application, in-gallery observations, and analysis of usage data and user-generated content shared by artcasting users.

This project is interdisciplinary, involving researchers from Digital Education and Design Informatics at the University of Edinburgh, and drawing in expertise from the National Galleries of Scotland and Tate, associate galleries and young people. It will contribute to scholarly and practical understanding of cultural heritage evaluation of learning and engagement.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The following groups and organisations will benefit from this research within the project funding period (2015-16): 

- The network of sixty-six associate galleries across the UK which have hosted ARTIST ROOMS exhibitions, and galleries which subsequently join the network. 

- The National Galleries of Scotland and Tate, joint hosts of ARTIST ROOMS.

- Cultural heritage educators, such as those represented by the 'engage' network.

These groups will be invited to attend workshops, participate in regular Twitter chats, and engage with the project team via the web site and blog. The project's steering group includes representatives from each group, and will ensure that emerging opportunities to engage with the wider groups are taken up. The key anticipated impact of this project is an influence on evaluation practice amongst these groups, leading to a greater enthusiasm for the possibilities of evaluation, and a new mobilities-based framework with which to explore those possibilities, and ultimately to more digital innovations like artcasting.

Researchers in the fields of arts evaluation, museum and gallery learning, and digital education (see academic beneficiaries) will be able to engage with and benefit from the project from the outset, with the publicly available and continually updated web site, and regular events such as the Twitter chats open to all interested participants. The project's dissemination strategy aims to ensure that these three fields are targeted via conference presentations and peer-reviewed publications. 

Software developers and programmers will engage with the project through the open hack event, and this will extend the reach of the project's activities and findings to the technology sector. The artcasting application will be preserved and shared, benefiting other developers and researchers interested in this type of intervention.

In the longer term, the project will be of use to funding bodies, policymakers and cultural heritage organisational leadership involved in making decisions about evaluation practice in museums and galleries, by providing robust, well-theorised evidence of the impact of innovation on evaluation in the context of a major national exhibition. 

Finally, evaluation approaches which build on this research will positively impact upon the experience of museum and gallery users, as galleries learn more about what engages and inspires audiences. Ultimately, the project aims to enrich cultural heritage engagement and learning for members of the public.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>149541</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>An illustration of the artcasting processes at the Bowes Museum, created by illustrator Mitch Miller in partnership with the artcasting research team.</gtr:description><gtr:id>E5F235FF-4B7B-447A-9432-B6EEC31BACF8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Artcasting dialectogram, created by the artist Mitch Miller, has provided the research team with an engaging and accessible method of describing and sharing research findings, and has been used in online and face-to-face settings (for example the Common Ground event in York in 2016) to form the basis of a richer understanding of the project and its contributions.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56b8b78ba0a268.21246282</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Artcasting dialectogram</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artwork</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://datashare.is.ed.ac.uk/handle/10283/2192</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Edinburgh Art Festival</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:description>Artcasting at the Edinburgh Art Festival</gtr:description><gtr:id>62CAC1EC-FEDF-4A1E-8B16-2A7669643625</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A pilot version of Artcasting which was tested with a small number of Festival participants.

Speaking on behalf of NGS, one of the partners noted how the key project finding that evaluation and engagement could be more closely integrated, and how digital tools can be part of this, has become part of the conversation at strategic levels in the organisation. These conversations around evaluation strategy will continue as NGS develops its new branding, and identifies target audiences.

We have explored new avenues for the artcasting concept, including our pilot work with the Edinburgh Art Festival on using artcasting to explore the 2016 Festival theme of monuments; and working with five partners to develop a follow-on project (under review) to engage and understand new cultural heritage audiences.

The Artcasting concept and findings continue to be widely shared and discussed: in spring 2016, we conducted workshops about re-imagining evaluation with staff at two ARTIST ROOMS associate galleries (Harris Museum in Preston; Ferens Gallery in Hull), and hosted a one-day event on the topic of Cultural Heritage, Digital Engagement and Visitor Experience, bringing together participants from 21 cultural organisations and 9 universities. We delivered an invited Artcasting seminar to the Australian National Maritime Museum in Sydney (September 2016), and will be presenting about the work to a delegation from Nanjing Museum in China in March 2017. We undertook a wide range of public engagement activities during and after the project period, including twitter chats with the UK's Digital Learning Network and Australia's Museum Education Oz group; drop-in sessions in both pilot locations with members of the public, and presentations at museum and gallery events in London, Edinburgh, Glasgow and the Museums and the Web professional conference in Los Angeles. Participant feedback from one of our public engagement events captures a strong sense of the value of this project in fostering engagement with art and helping museums and galleries understand visitor engagement and experience: &amp;quot;I don't know what people in the arts do when they attend to an exhibition like this, but I think that many people just see, think, feel, but do not share their feelings, thoughts nor imaginations with anyone. What you are doing here is providing ways for people to express themselves, to share with others their experience of attending to an exhibition&amp;quot; (artcasting @ explorathon participant, September 2015).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>AD2D02B1-7858-47A9-987F-1AF44806192A</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56dee004e86b80.03488076</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Two research questions informed the project: 1) How does offering visitors a way to align their impressions of the ROOM with specific places help them articulate their engagement with the work? 2) How can a mobilities approach which asks visitors to make connections between art and place constitute meaningful evaluation practice?

In responding to these questions, the project team found that:
- Artcasting demonstrates the complexity of holding different understandings of value together, but also the richness of potential outcomes when evaluation and engagement are approached in theoretically imaginative ways - in this case through the lens of mobilities theory. There is a continuing need for new theoretical and applied approaches in this area, and for theoretically informed critiques of evaluation to be part of conversations in academia and in interdisciplinary work in cultural heritage settings.
- Developing a conceptual connection between evaluation and mobilities is generative. The measurement of value in the context of exhibitions tends to focus on individual experience, development, or well-being, grounded in understandings of the human subject interacting with external objects and places. Mobilities theory provides an alternative theoretical framework that shifts the site of analysis away from the psychology of exhibition visitors, or the development of audiences, and towards a richer understanding of the complex relations between the humans, technologies and spaces involved. Artcasting generated an innovative approach through which galleries might engage the public in the capture of both qualitative and quantitative metrics.
- Artcasting invites a rethinking of the ideal of co-production in cultural heritage settings. It is a form of public interpretation of the artwork, and visitors are creating new and varied encounters with art in new places and times - the gallery guest becoming the host of a new exhibition. Ultimately, these types of digital and mobile interventions challenge the stability of relationships of co-production. 
- The development and piloting of the Artcasting app and the discussions and debates around it formed a methodological approach consistent with the concept of 'speculative method' (Lury &amp;amp; Wakeford 2012) and 'cultural probe' (Gaver et al. 1999), generative approaches which engage as well as investigate, and which help envision and create futures - in the case of Artcasting, around arts evaluation. Significant insights and understandings of forms of value will continue to be unlocked as the app operates in the public domain and with new users and partnerships.
- Engagement with mobilities theory can have significant consequences for design practice. Engagement with mobilities theory steered the Artcasting app towards a design that emphasised the movement and trajectory of artworks, time as well as space, and the importance of the 're-encounter' beyond the gallery; and challenged more traditional understandings of what is possible and desirable in evaluation.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Some key implications for practice from the project concern: 1) the value of asking new questions and taking inventive approaches to research collaborations between academic and cultural heritage organisations; 2) the complexity of app development for in-gallery use in terms of access, flexible implementation, and partnerships; 3) the need for cultural heritage organisations to reflect on their evaluation agenda; and to consider how evaluation practice can take better account of the value of dialogue; 4) how Artcasting offers a new approach to arts based evaluation derived from visitors' imaginative encounters with art, and demonstrates that visitors can engage creatively with exhibitions in ways that provide rich insights for reflection and practice.

Beyond the cultural heritage sector, there are possibilities for Artcasting, too. In March 2016, we presented Artcasting at Codebase (an Edinburgh-based technology incubator), and spoke to developers and other attendees about alternative models for Artcasting. Through a series of conversations with members of tech start-ups, we highlighted the technical principles of the application, and used its current manifestation as an instance of use within the cultural sector. The conversations led to a series of speculations about how the technology could be applied to other areas, for example: 1) capturing geographic perspectives from television or radio audiences; 2) Artcasting as a socio-technical habit associated to many forms social media, geographically associating content alongside liking, retweeting, reposting or sharing; 3) mapping as a form of commenting (for example, in TripAdvisor whilst comments are often about a place, rarely is there a chance to point to another place on a map); 4) maps and places as 'streams' of content (as Pinterest, Tumblr and Instagram are popular streams of images collected from disparate sources but curated under one theme or identity) - for example tagging music playlists with places that are associated with individual pieces of music; 5) Artcasting as a method of capturing an entire event, with the time and space of artcasts having a particular signature, and potentially offering a unique way of capturing audience data for any event (for example, Glastonbury, the Royal Highland Show); 6) use of Artcasting in shops and chains to promote products and opportunities to loyal customers, working with customers to find appropriate places and times to receive offers.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>50494582-3A78-4CE4-A4D5-44F38D621A1D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56c20ee3e95990.90881921</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www.artcastingproject.net/project-outline/end-of-project-report/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>Mobile application for gallery visitors to engage with concepts of place and movement in relation to artworks.</gtr:description><gtr:id>0F97000B-7F7A-4942-AD86-E5480993C204</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The development of the artcasting app allowed us to generate evaluation data in a novel way and to explore methods of analysing and visualising this for the benefit of museum and gallery partners.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>565dc1282abe50.81211991</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Artcasting mobile application</gtr:title><gtr:type>Webtool/Application</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://github.com/BarkerCreations/Artcasting</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BC97881C-3823-474C-B05D-240663B1630A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Cultural Heritage Communities: Technologies and Challenges</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6bca95c50139991d8d9ff6a06a4e2480"><gtr:id>6bca95c50139991d8d9ff6a06a4e2480</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ross, J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56d02d52bbd5b8.83271120</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8439E9DE-5036-4647-91CB-ECFCC63CB060</gtr:id><gtr:title>Speculative method in digital education research</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Learning, Media and Technology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b90fcb86f8ff0ef88ec4421190f7ff22"><gtr:id>b90fcb86f8ff0ef88ec4421190f7ff22</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ross J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>585d50fb7bab92.52356427</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/M008177/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp;
