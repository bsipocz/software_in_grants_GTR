The work of young interpreters is very common but highly undervalued and unrecognised (Antonini, 2010). Child language brokers (CLBs) interpret or translate between family members/peers and officials (usually adults) who do not speak the home language. They are referred to as language brokers because the role often requires them to act as negotiators or intermediaries of cultural values, norms and knowledge, and positions them across different spaces of belonging. In other words, they literally &amp;quot;Translate Cultures&amp;quot;. The aim of this project is to provide new understandings of how cultural knowledge and identities of belonging are narrated by the child language brokers.

Findings from the PIs previous work have indicated that child language brokers feel a great deal of pride in interpreting for family and peers but do not feel recognised, valued or fully understood outside of this immediate sphere of experience. This project will render their work visible in two novel ways: by researching how cultural knowledge and identities are mediated by language brokering and by producing a documentary film and web exhibition to enhance awareness of the valuable contribution made by young language brokers. 

It will do this by using interdisciplinary methodologies combining digital film, ethnographic observations, voice recorded diaries, written diaries and art work e.g. self-portraiture. These combined methodologies have never been used in research with child language brokers and will provide unchartered insight into brokers' identities of belonging and contributors of cultural knowledge. As previously mentioned, a key output will be a documentary film that will bring together a set of non-linear arts activities in a summarising format that speaks to enhancing the awareness of a largely invisible group of young people. The film content will be led by the young people but is likely to include audio/video from the observational ethnography (with respondent's permission), video of a series of arts event activities with commentary about those activities by the young people themselves. Event activities include, but not exclusively so, script writing, suitcase method, and 'self in space' portraiture. Finally, these materials will be co-creatively curated with some of the participating young people into a web exhibition. This in itself is a part of the narrative journey.

The project draws on a range of expertise including the Young Interpreter Network and Routes into Language, who will assist in recruiting respondents. Alan Fentiman (film maker and web designer) has extensive experience working with vulnerable young people through film. Claire Robins runs arts workshops with young people and curates participatory museum exhibitions. Advisory group expertise includes specialist knowledge of children's identities, ethnography, child language brokering and bilingualism (Oxford Brookes University, Open University, University College London, IOE), participatory arts and museum studies (Media, Culture and Communication, IOE), and policy advice (Language Centre Cambridge/Speak to the Future). There will be three full team meetings and two network meetings that will involve the research team, interpreter/language specialists, policy advisors, film/photography makers, and some more 'mature' young interpreters. There will a web exhibition launch and conference event involving the young people, their parents, academics, language networks and policy advisors. We will ask a range of professional networks to show the film and web exhibition on their online sites/TV networks.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will raise awareness of child language brokers and in turn encourage the valuing of language use and bilingualism within society. In light of current lack of information, this project has the potential to influence key institutions like schools and healthcare, local authorities and their attention to multiple language use in policy and practice, and community organisations and groups. Children have been translating for family and friends throughout history, but perhaps because children have sometimes been overlooked in some areas of research, or maybe because of the stigma and intolerance associated with being a migrant to a new country, these young people have been largely ignored in academic, policy, education, and the arts. Despite language being a central feature of the literate arts, children as language brokers have not been part of artistic endeavours. Findings and outputs will bring this very important area of study into new arenas. 

Children who language broker for their parents have reported feeling isolated, stressed, depressed and sometimes judged or 'spotlight' by others when carrying out their brokering. Carrying out this research gives value to young people for the work they do, strengthens their sense of positive identity, and alleviates stress by showing that they are valued, visible, and important. This project will optimise the connections with policy advisors (via Bernardette Holmes), language networks (YIN &amp;amp; RiL), schools/colleges (TeachersTV/Teachers Media), health sector networks (HealthSector TV) and using social media to promote activities. 

The Young Interpreter Network (YIN) will also disseminate to its partner schools/colleges and organisations. We can build on the success of YINs Guardian Public Service Award to enhance the awareness of language broker activities through the documentary film and web exhibition. This includes taking these outputs to other local authorities and raising awarenss around the country. Writing for the Times Educational Supplement and Guardian Education will broaden the coverage to both a wide range of professionals, academics and lay people. We will disseminate via key Twitter feeds and other social media (e.g. @TCRU1973; @YIscheme, @Routesintolanguage, @AHRCpress and so on). We will use outcomes to contribute to the existing package of guidance developed by YIN to help train young interpreters and the PI (Crafter), who developed guidance from a previous project for using language brokers in schools.
 
The project will develop knowledge and outputs that will enhance the activities of Routes into Language (RiL) whose widening participation activities are crucial for promoting language use, giving value to young people's activities, cultural awareness days and ambassadorial programmes. Routes into Language is a regional consortia covering the whole of England and Wales. We will disseminate via their web pages, at individual events, via Twitter and social media. The PI will give talks at events such as the ambassadors progression presentation, career days and cultural awareness days. 

The web exhibition, reports, presentations and academic publications will highlight the vital role that child language brokers play across many spaces and contexts. We know these young people's activities are largely invisible in the public consciousness and institutional settings. These research activities and the ensuing outputs will make those who do this activity feel recognised and valued.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-12-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>159987</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>During our project the young people engaged in a drawing workshop was led by a cultural psychologist with a background in using art for family therapy.

Afterwards they were asked to write down the story that described their drawing. The group then put their drawings together, deciding themselves what order the collection should follow, which facilitated a group discussion about how their stories and experiences were similar or different.

In this school the workshop took place in the school library and attracted pupils, teachers, Senior Leadership and a local network of English as an Additional Language coordinators. The exhibition was attended by the pupils who took part in the research and pupils in the wider school community. 

The exhibition has generated some changes within the schools that we worked in: 
1) The English teacher in one of the schools has asked to show the film and some of the artifacts from the exhibition to her classes in order to have a lesson around identity with them. 
2) The SENCO team of teachers in one of the schools are keen to work further with the artist and do a similar art workshop with children with special educational needs. They felt that the workshops and the exhibition really highlighted the work of CLBs and wanted to do the same for children with SEN. 

The young people's engagement in the workshops:
Many of the workshops took place in the young people's own or they went to considerable measures (travelling distances or taking time out from their studies) to be part of the project. We were both surprised and deeply heartened by the commitment and level of enthusiasm that they engaged in the workshops. 

The exhibition outputs:
Although the exhibitions brought the work of the young people to the wider school community it was very satisfying seeing the pride of the young people whose outputs were shown

School responses to the exhibition:
We had very positive feedback from Senior Leadership team who in many instances were understanding the role of their own young translators in school for the first time. We also had positive feedback from EAL coordinators from other schools

The success of the art workshops, meant that we wanted to take the exhibition to a wider audience, so we applied for a small amount of funding to take part in the Bloomsbury Festival. We were successful and this took take place on October 22nd 2016. 

Lastly, we were invited to take part in an international workshop based at UCL on 'convivial tools for research'. Here we will presented a paper on using arts based methods in research (based on our experiences using funding from beacon bursary). This workshop allowed us to foster new academic links as well as produce an article in an edited journal. It would not have been possible to do this without the help of the bursary.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ab27f4731258.62620784</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ucl.ac.uk/ioe/news-events/news-pub/august-2016/tcru-exhibition-many-voices-many-languages-being-a-young-translator</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Exhibition in school</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D2B8B07C-EA91-43DD-B9E7-574AC19FB7F6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This exhibitions took place on the 14th in a school in South London and involved showing all elements of the outputs from arts-based workshops with the child language brokers.

The exhibition was attended by the pupils who took part in the research and pupils in the wider school community. 

We evaluated the success of the exhibition in two ways:

Participants wrote their comments on a large cloth
We received verbal and email feedback from teachers. 

For example, one EAL teacher wrote to us and said:

&amp;quot;Thank you so much for everything. I am not sure how will you (Sarah and Humera) measure the success of it, but for the feedback I am having in the corridors, it was great! Some teachers are even talking about the need to open up a space for a more active dialogue and exchange. I was impressed also but all the work I haven't seen ,I can't wait to hear the radio show or see more illustrations, they were so revealing. You must feel terribly proud. Thank you so much for letting me be a part of it.&amp;quot;

Another said: 

&amp;quot;Today I got a buzz because I felt so good about the exhibition. It was a great end of a very demanding year. 
Thank you for organising all this and for all of your hard work to make this happen.&amp;quot;

Following the completion of the hands workshop the same teacher also emailed us and said:

&amp;quot;Dear Sarah and Humera,

today the workshop went really well and everybody has almost finished their hands. We are really happy with the results. Pia has done a great job and the girls were really proud and happy. There was a magical atmosphere and I hope that we can keep the momentum.

This gave me inspirations for future projects, because it was great to see how everybody was growing in being able to express themselves under the guidance and care of Pia.

Thank you again for allowing us to be part of your great project. It has been a real journey of revelation for me and for the girls and for the department.&amp;quot;

A selection of comments written on the giant feedback wall/cloth. Some directly address the exhibition whilst others speak to the content. They come from a mixture of teachers, EAL coordinators and pupils:

&amp;quot;I loved learning about your translators and watching the film&amp;quot; (Pupil)
&amp;quot;Fantastic work! Very impressive! You should all be proud. A Thomas, All Saints School&amp;quot; (EAL coordinator)
&amp;quot;I've loved looking at the different hands. I didn't realise the range of language spoken at [name of the school], and the amount of people that are young translators for families and friends&amp;quot; (pupil)

With young people who act as language brokers we ran three arts-based workshops and delivered two exhibitions in the respective schools where the workshops took place and one exhibition as part of the Bloomsbury Festival. 

The art workshops:
One art workshop took place at a girls school in Clapham and was led by a freelance artist/educator, Pia Jaime. Inspired by sculptures called Ex-Votos, the girls who took part in the workshop made plastercast hands to act as symbolic portraits of their identity as young translators. She worked with the young people to produce sculptures, using rubber gloves as plaster casts, which the students appropriated using images, words and carving techniques.

Another art workshop was run by Evangelia Prokopiou and took place in a school in Dagenham. Evangelia is a cultural psychologist with a therapeutic background, so this workshop used drawing to examine a specific moment or emotion related to translating and interpreting. The young people's drawing, text and narratives about the situations were drawn together into an online book. The online book was designed by Kremena Dimitrova. 

The Radio magazine show workshop:
Part of the film shown at the exhibitions is 'voiced' by our young people who took part in the Radio magazine workshop facilitated by Eastside Educational Trust. Led by Michael Vidon, the workshop provided themes around which the young people explored 'language' such as family, age, personal space, and boundaries. The young people developed their own podcasts in groups, each detailing issues relating to their young translating and identity that are important to them. This workshop took place at the Bloomsbury Theatre here at UCL. Young people from both schools came together for this workshop. 

The Exhibitions:
The exhibitions took place in July 2016 (school) and October 2016 (Bloomsbury Festival). The exhibitions involved showing all elements of the outputs from the workshops discussed above. In one school the workshop took place in the school library and in the other school it took place under a marquee tent in the playground. The young people, the wider school community and parents were invited to attend. The Bloomsbury Festival exhibition was in the Art Museum in UCL.

We collated qualitative responses from teachers, pupils and parents who attended the exhibitions. We received verbal and email feedback from teachers. 

For example, one EAL teacher wrote to us and said:

&amp;quot;Thank you so much for everything. I am not sure how will you (Sarah and Humera) measure the success of it, but for the feedback I am having in the corridors, it was great! Some teachers are even talking about the need to open up a space for a more active dialogue and exchange. I was impressed also but all the work I haven't seen ,I can't wait to hear the radio show or see more illustrations, they were so revealing. You must feel terribly proud. Thank you so much for letting me be a part of it.&amp;quot;

Another said: 

&amp;quot;Today I got a buzz because I felt so good about the exhibition. It was a great end of a very demanding year. 
Thank you for organising all this and for all of your hard work to make this happen.&amp;quot;

Following the completion of the hands workshop the same teacher also emailed us and said:

&amp;quot;Dear Sarah and Humera,

today the workshop went really well and everybody has almost finished their hands. We are really happy with the results. Pia has done a great job and the girls were really proud and happy. There was a magical atmosphere and I hope that we can keep the momentum.

This gave me inspirations for future projects, because it was great to see how everybody was growing in being able to express themselves under the guidance and care of Pia.

Thank you again for allowing us to be part of your great project. It has been a real journey of revelation for me and for the girls and for the department.&amp;quot;

A selection of comments written on the giant feedback wall/cloth. Some directly address the exhibition whilst others speak to the content. They come from a mixture of teachers, EAL coordinators and pupils:

&amp;quot;I loved learning about your translators and watching the film&amp;quot; (Pupil)
&amp;quot;Fantastic work! Very impressive! You should all be proud. A Thomas, All Saints School&amp;quot; (EAL coordinator)
&amp;quot;I've loved looking at the different hands. I didn't realise the range of language spoken at La Retraite, and the amount of people that are young translators for families and friends&amp;quot; (pupil) 
&amp;quot;This exhibition is inspirational and shows how important languages are to communication&amp;quot; (pupil)
&amp;quot;I had a fund experience when I joined this workshop. I learned that you have to be yourself in front of everyone&amp;quot; [her mother visited the exhibition and wrote] &amp;quot;I enjoyed being in this exhibition and I am a happy and proud mother&amp;quot;

The young people's engagement in the workshops:
Many of the workshops took place in the young people's own or they went to considerable measures (travelling distances or taking time out from their studies) to be part of the project. We were both surprised and deeply heartened by the commitment and level of enthusiasm that they engaged in the workshops. 

The exhibition has generated some changes within the schools that we worked in: 
1) The English teacher in one of the schools has asked to show the film and some of the artifacts from the exhibition to her classes in order to have a lesson around identity with them. 
2) The SENCO team of teachers in one of the schools are keen to work further with the artist and do a similar art workshop with children with special educational needs. They felt that the workshops and the exhibition really highlighted the work of CLBs and wanted to do the same for children with SEN.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>803D3DF4-E763-4AF1-8767-1FA754476606</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56dc0875ba7228.94054769</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project utilised a combination of social science research methods and arts-based methods to collect data about child language brokers' experiences of mediating cultural knowledge and identity belonging across contexts. 

Vignette interviews
The vignette interview is the primary data collection technique which foregrounds our project. Vignettes are short stories or scenarios about a fictional character experiencing a phenomenon in context (Crafter et al. 2015). Four vignettes were all adapted from real experiences of language brokers found in the literature. All four vignettes involve some kind of different situation which the language broker must negotiate or manage through their language brokering. In two of the scenarios the character is attempting to language broker different forms of cultural knowledge. 

Thirty young people took part in this element of the study and the interviews produced a rich level of data. There are a range of useful thematic findings but most pertinent to the aims and objectives of this project was a focus on how these young people managed conflict. In some cases young people described being an Active Broker, either changing the nature of conversations, managing the language used by both parties or managing the emotional space. The sometimes described themselves as a Neutral Broker, which was much more akin to professional translating, whereby they saw themselves only as their parents mouthpiece. At other times they were Conflict Avoidance and would entirely withdraw or remove themselves from the situation. 

The data from our arts-based outputs are still being analysed. We undertook drawing workshops, sculpture workshops, drama role-play and a radio magazine podcast day. We are keen to analyse the narratives, discussions and stories produced during these sessions. 

The final report is still being written but will be put on the website when it is complete.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our data about young people's experiences of language brokering in sensitive or tricky situations can be put to use informing adults about how to manage the brokering situation. Many of our young people described being placed in sensitive situations and discussed the role that adults played. 

Additionally, relationships with family members, particularly parents, featured strongly in our data. This work can make a contribution to academic work on family care practices and parent-child relationships following migration. 

We do feel that this study makes a new and positive contribution to the field of child language brokering in general.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>16088AD9-3188-4FD2-A5F9-1864EEF78629</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dc08b87bfa31.27920755</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://languagebrokeringidentities.com</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E295667E-20A5-485D-9028-7BDDBDED4A50</gtr:id><gtr:title>Child language brokering in cultural contact zones: Young people's experiences of critical moments.</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/beb251d4f49b2229294971f5f874cd2b"><gtr:id>beb251d4f49b2229294971f5f874cd2b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Crafter S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58ab2d3b32c6a8.00393663</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>66E9D4AC-3FB9-4107-B949-602F0A7AD00B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Child language brokering: Spaces of belonging and mediators of cultural knowledge.</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/beb251d4f49b2229294971f5f874cd2b"><gtr:id>beb251d4f49b2229294971f5f874cd2b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Crafter S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58ab324d6a1ef3.49127770</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E28104DF-3651-4D9D-9445-7196B618EDFB</gtr:id><gtr:title>Child Language Brokering in Superdiverse Settings: Contact zones and cultural mediation.</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/beb251d4f49b2229294971f5f874cd2b"><gtr:id>beb251d4f49b2229294971f5f874cd2b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Crafter S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58ab31dbd24670.64568587</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/M003744/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E457FFDE-A4C1-4907-AE12-A394D95A3AE5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cognitive Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>62F4842F-55F4-41C6-A77A-572005E91429</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Community Art inc A &amp; H</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ABBA5192-0B16-4BC8-8B3F-3A48625872F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0BD15AF-D726-4525-A824-5C01385833D3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ethnography &amp; Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
