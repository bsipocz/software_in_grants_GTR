I utilise new technologies and integrate new media artworks into the public domain as part of the ongoing research into the visualisation of cityspace. In essence I am researching data as a medium for creativity and how meaningful experiences of our cities may result.\n\nI was a NESTA Dreamtime Fellow from February 2004/5. During that time, I focused on new technologies and their relationship to urban space. As a consequence, for this Fellowship in the Creative and Performing Arts, I now aim to research new technologies, sensors, motes, display technologies and interactive architectures. The proposal, 'The Emergent City' incorporates investigations inot movements of people, the pollution in the air, the vibrations and sounds of city spaces. The proposed research also focuses on the micro-incidents of change in the weather, traffic noise variations and people flow. The archives of this data will be controlled via bespoke online interfaces that can re-form and re-contextualise experiences in real time, to make emergent artworks.\n\nBy investigating these data structures I aim to create new metaphors relevant to the experience of the city. The patterns we make, the visual and imaginative interpretations we give to real world events, are already being networked into retrievable data structures that can be re-imagined and sourced for information. These patterns disclose new ways of seeing the world. An example might be to monitor noise levels, and to develop artworks based on the results. The value of gathering and re-presenting this data in artistic form, and then analysing its impact and influence, lies in making meaning accessible to a wider audience.\n\nI aim to set up a wireless sensor network to visualise cities, as environments full of data. Once these data spaces are created they can help us understand the fundamentals of our outside environment. I have outlined two prototypes experiments to begin with in order to test the credibility of this project's concepts. The first prototype will be made for a building, and the second for the space around the building (ie, the environment or city space). I will gather assets and make narratives for creating understanding. Translating the minutae into something we understand or at least into something we can experience.\n\nInstead o adopting narrative threads from the media, I am interested in the currency that exists already in the city space. I am focused on the wider picture of city experiences which are being played out in real time. This sort of experience of multi nodes, and multi threaded spaces, demands a refined gathering of data, a sensitive accumulation which can then lead to some kind of modelling and visualisation [audible and visual (mis)-representation] of the social network as it exists and is impacted upon.\n\nI am interested in thinking through , making and then offering some new media solutions for development and experimentation in this domain. I am at a stage where I am looking to deploy a wireless sensor network both for indoor and outdoor use incorporating this technology.\n\nIn summary, I would sum up my aim as the intention of creating a visual art work informed by critical analysis and data-cities.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-06-05</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-06-06</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>222602</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/D502233/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8BB67751-1AD5-4EE8-9104-089D5F236DDB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Digital Arts HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A8CCE2FA-9D1B-4880-9BD3-C4C078F9CD7F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Fine Art HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>02EB1D72-607A-4467-BF3A-A60E567738E9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Time-Based Media HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
