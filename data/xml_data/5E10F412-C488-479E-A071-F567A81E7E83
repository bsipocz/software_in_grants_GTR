The research is specifically concerned with post-war approaches to the past that bring disparate histories of violence into relation with one another and, in so doing, illuminate the dynamic structure of collective memory. Despite the memory boom of the 1990s and the attendant rise of trauma theory in the past decades, there remains a tendency to consider traumatic events - and the Holocaust in particular - as singular, incomparable and unrepresentable. The radical singularity of the Holocaust remains something of a critical doxa, even though the Nazi genocide continues to generate hermeneutic models that have illuminated other histories, such as the Algerian war or the genocide in Rwanda. Thus, although thinkers such as Hannah Arendt, Aim&amp;eacute; C&amp;eacute;saire and Frantz Fanon forged links between the Nazi genocide and colonialism in the immediate aftermath of World War II, scholars in French and Francophone Studies have, until recently, rarely addressed the historical, representational and commemorative connections between the Holocaust and other legacies of racialised violence. This is, in part, due to the taboo on invidious comparisons between the Holocaust and other genocides, but also because entrenched disciplinary boundaries between national histories, literatures, and fields (such as the compartmentalisation of Holocaust Studies and Postcolonial Studies, or French and Francophone Studies) have discouraged such research programmes.\n\nThis research seeks to move beyond reified structures of discipline and field in order to reopen the question of cultural memory in a transnational age. Without relativising the singularity of diverse histories of violence, the research probes the points of contact between the memories and lacies of genocide, colonialism and slavery in a world defined both by decolonisation and the aftermath of the Holocaust. The research thus aims to contribute to the emergence of a pluralised conception of history and memory, one that investigates the points of contact between distinct legacies of historical trauma, and in so doing, illuminates the layered structure and unpredictable energy of collective memory.\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Outside the academic community, the research is of particular interest to minority ethnic groups concerned with the fraught relationship between race, memory and identity and its effect on inter-community relations. The research seeks to challenge essentialist accounts of race, memory and identity and the damaging separation, competition and conflict between groups that such accounts often (if unconsciously) promote. I will therefore:\n\na) organise a round-table discussion at the University of Leeds involving academics and members of local communities (Jewish, Muslim and others) to discuss the findings of the research with the specific intention of reframing entrenched views;\n\nb) publicise the findings of the research in the Jewish community itself through talks and non-academic articles;\n\nc) plan for a network of like-minded researchers whose brief will include dissemination of findings in different communities and public events around memory and identity. \n\n\n\n\n\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>45181</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Influenced researchers and students in thinking about questions of cultural memory in relation to moments of extreme violence.</gtr:description><gtr:id>168C6286-65CB-46A9-9CDC-CFB0684E99AC</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545b5c6ccf3505.84913276</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Cultural memories relating to the Holocaust and colonialism are interconnected.
