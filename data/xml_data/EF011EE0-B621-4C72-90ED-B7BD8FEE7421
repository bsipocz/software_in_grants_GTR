Large numbers of people participate regularly in some form of spiritual practice, and particularly significant are those practices named as 'spiritualities of life' (e.g. yoga, meditation, t'ai chi and forms of massage). These practices are distinguished from formalised religious systems by the idea of 'right' conduct that they entail. In religious practice, individuals assess their conduct with reference to ethical codes or external rules formulated by the religion, whereas in spiritualities of life an inward gaze means that conduct is determined in relation to individual feelings, emotions and bodily states. This means that multiple spiritualities are being formed through individual and context specific practices, and it is these multiple spiritualities that this research addresses. \n\nThis sector has become one of the most contested areas of life, often dismissed as self-indulgent, irrational or even dangerous by the media, researchers and key religious figures such as the Pope. The limited research existing into spiritualities of life has often tended to caricature the spiritual sector as non-authentic, exploitative or without meaning. With only a few exceptions to this, there has been little research that interrogates what these spiritualities of life mean to those individuals that engage with it, and what experiences people draw from participation in these practices. While the growing numbers of participants in spiritualities of life suggests that they are filling some kind of individual and social need, little in-depth research has been undertaken to find out what that need is, how it is related to everyday lives of participants, and how it differs with different dimensions of social difference (in particular gender and socio-economic difference).\n\nUsing Brighton - a city known for its holistic milieu - as a case study, the research will address this gap by looking in detail at how ordinary people negotiate the spiritual in their everyday lives, and use the spiritual as a means of coping with their family and work commitments. This case study approach will allow interrogation of spiritualities of life as practices that are embedded within, rather than separate from, the context of ongoing everyday lives. The research will ask whether the spiritual is an individually experienced and understood dimension of life, dependent on context and situation, or if there are commonalities of experience held between people. The research will use diaries to understand how people negotiate and locate the spiritual within their working and family lives, offering support for, or contradicting these.\n\nThe project will use qualitative methods to achieve this fine-grained analysis. Specifically, in-depth interviews will be conducted with teachers and pupils of practices that are classed as spiritualities of life (e.g. yoga, t'ai chi, meditation), a diary-based study will locate the spiritual alongside everyday work and life, and ethnographic research which will interrogate the formal and less formal spaces of spiritual practice. The outputs from the project include a data archive on the experiences of the spiritual in everyday context that will be beneficial for future research into spiritualities across the social sciences, research papers in academic peer reviewed journals, and presentations at appropriate conferences. Final reports on the project's findings will be written and disseminated to local communities and organisations concerned with urban welfare and social justice, and also to practitioner communities. These reports will suggest some of the benefits and costs of spiritualities of life in the urban context, and will draw out some examples of how the experiences and meanings arising from spiritual practices can be usefully used to reshape the urban towards wellbeing, greater equality and social justice.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Beneficiaries:\nIt is possible to foresee wider economic and societal impacts arising from this research around quality of life, and best practice in the areas of spiritual practices. The research will allow a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between the spiritual and urban life, with the potential of changing ways of thinking and acting. There are two main groups for whom the research will have impacts:\n\n1) Practitioner communities - This research is concerned with the tangible effects of spiritualities of life on everyday urban lives. At present, while there is much anecdotal or experiential evidence, there is little formalised or written documentation of this. In providing this, the research will allow the practitioner community to relate better to the needs of the people it serves. It will also contribute to the debates currently ongoing about practitioner identities and ethical teaching codes. The research will draw out some of the costs and benefits of the current methods of teaching spiritualities of life, and will develop some examples of good practice in relation to these.\n\n2) Communities concerned with urban welfare - Spiritualities of life are increasingly being used by actors such community groups, charities, and businesses, to provide ways to decrease stress, increase wellbeing, and develop social capital. This research traces how spiritual practices are being used within the community, and are coming to shape public and private urban lives and spaces. It will create an evidence base that will help these organisations understand the way in which spiritual practices relate to ideas of wellbeing, equality and social justice. The evidence will help direct the use of such practices, and might also be mobilised to gain funding for further community projects. The research also has the potential to impact positively on quality of life and health in the urban context. It will illuminate aspects of 'good living' in urban spaces and times, and suggest elements of spiritual practice that might be integrated more generally into the urban everyday. \n\nDissemination:\nThe research will draw on existing links with the practitioner community, and will develop new links with local government and NGOs. The impact of the research will be delivered throughout the period of the grant. Communication and engagement with both sets of beneficiaries will work through the development of informal feedback on the ground, and the more formal production of an end of project report (distributed in physical and electronic formats). These reports will be distributed to local organisations in Brighton who are known to be concerned with such issues, and through snowballing, will be distributed on a national scale. Council departments (concerned with culture, sport, health and wellbeing) will also be targeting on a national level (here, existing links with, for example, Edinburgh city council, will be utilised). Given that the spiritual milieu in Brighton is relatively well established, the research will also speak more widely to other urban areas in which the spiritual is less well established.\n\nIn addition, these research links will provide lasting impacts, providing potential for future research into the relationship between religion and society in the case of spiritualities of life, and meaning that the findings of the research may reverberate through policy and practice (in both sets of actors) over the coming years. The research will also develop the career of the named RA in particular, adding value to funding provided by research councils for masters, PhD and postdoctoral training, and equipping them with valuable research skills that will help to build a lasting research career. \n\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>78440</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>New Spiritualities Under Debate Workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4B77FBD4-F2BC-4AA4-9CA3-044DB591AD8B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In part at the instigation of one of the leading contributors to current debates around this theme, the project team organised a small workshop specifically on the theme of 'New Spiritualities', inviting a select group of cross-disciplinary scholars (c.15) who are expert in this domain of religious/spiritual studies. This event, held in May 2011, was a great success, judging by the quality of the short presentations and lengthy discussions, as well as from the feedback that we have received from delegates. It included a presentation on our own project rationale and findings.

The workshop was audio-recorded, and converted into a series of audio-casts hosted on the AHRC 'Religion and Society' website: Note that our project was funded under the auspices of the AHRC-ESRC 'Religion and Society' programme convened by Professor Linda Woodhead, who participated at the workshop. The workshop has allowed an 'up-scaling' of our project findings and their prompts to thinking from those present to a potentially much larger audience.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545398ac84e651.38260643</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academic audiences (collaborators, peers etc.)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.religionandsociety.org.uk/publications/podcasts/show/new_spiritualities_podcast_where_now_for_new_spiritualities</gtr:url><gtr:year>2011</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>New Spiritualities Website</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>54A87585-CA84-4D64-9394-BE3FCD93D1E8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The project team created a dedicated website, 'The everyday urban spiritual' project website.

This project explores the intimacies of 'the everyday urban spiritual', disclosing how the so-called 'new-spiritual' practices of yoga/meditation can become meaningfully integrated into the grain of routine lives. Many implications follow for practitioners as citizens and workers, but arguably too for the broader life of the city both as individual stories are 'scaled up' (our research participants are just the tip of an iceberg) and given the immanent embodied critique that these stories hold for the standard dynamics of contemporary ('fast') capitalism. The character of our interpretative evidence, dependent on rich detail, is such that it cannot readily be encapsulated here; but we highlight the following findings. 
 
AIM 1: Spiritual space-times 
*The city is pockmarked with sites of new-spiritual practices, formal and informal, and criss-crossed by the daily routines of many individuals for whom such sites - regularly accessed and/or (momentarily) created - clearly matter hugely, as a source of spiritual questing (but not direction: see below), physical and mental well-being, social networking, community-making and even improved resources for coping with workplace challenges. 
*Such practices can hence be 'fitted in' to the fabric of urban life, but they also 'leak out' from the specific sites where they are expressly pursued, arguably gaining a (potential) significance far beyond their apparent provenance (even within individual lives). 
*The urban context is integral to practices such as yoga/meditation, enabling them to occur (through a density of networks, friendships, facilities, opportunities) but sometimes also blocking their sustainability (a product of busyness, competitiveness and costs). 
*Carving out appropriate sites/moments of the requisite 'slowness', 'stillness' and 'focus' for the effective practice of yoga/meditation - set-apart from the maelstrom of fast-paced, multi-tasking urban life, even in a more provincial setting like Brighton - can be done, but is far from easy. 
*There are serious obstacles to both breaking older habits of living - often entailing self-destructive patterns of thought (too busy, abstracted, multi-orientated), comportment ('holding ourselves all wrong') and behaviour (too fast, materialist, careless) - and establishing new, healthier, ones with a sustained yogic/meditative component. 
*The particular sites of practice - whether a designated class, a home space or an outdoor space, the latter two being momentarily adapted or appropriated for the purpose; whether occupied individually or shared with others - can make a decisive difference to the experience (and effects/affects) of the practices undertaken. 
 
AIM 2: spiritual identities 
*Yoga/meditation are often taken up during moments of transition or crisis, such as personal/family illness, bereavement and changing lifeworlds and ambitions, and for many the practices offer a niche where both mainstream religion and Western healthcare fail. 
*The experience and take-up of yoga/meditation is deeply connected with other aspects of an individual's identity and biography - primarily mental and physical health, gender and employment status - but we must be hesitant about caricaturing exactly who are these new-spiritual practitioners. 
*The spiritual biographies of individuals who practice yoga/meditation are complex and the relationship with key religions (primarily Christianity) multi-faceted: individuals tend to conceive their practices here as integral to, complementary with or wholly separate from - at times even contesting - their chosen spiritual or religious path. 
 
AIM 3: spiritual authority 
*'Students' and teachers of yoga/meditation alike display a healthy scepticism towards gurus/spiritual leaders, broadening their critique into scepticism towards authority of any kind (religious, institutional, political). The preferred understanding of 'teacher' is as a well-respected guide and facilitator.

'NEW SPIRITUALITIES' 
While Heelas's (esp.2008) disputed claims about 'new spiritualities' were present as a context for the original application, they have ended up being more central to the content of our research, so much so that we are now in the process of: (i) developing a theoretically-inflected geographical critique of the Heelas 'new spiritualities' thesis, refracted in particular through the epochal Kendal study (Heelas &amp;amp; Woodward, 2005), wherein the spatial focus on one specific (to an extent counter-culturally identified) urban centre, Kendal, neatly parallels our own focus on Brighton and Hove; and (ii) deploying a wealth of our own empirical findings about the spiritual beliefs, imperatives and reasonings of our participants to demonstrate certain validities within Heelas's claims; hence marking the research in contradistinction to that of Carrette and King (2005), and many others who denounce the seeming 'pick 'n' mix' (individualistic, consumerist) approach taken by 'new-spiritual practitioners'. Of course, in practice our position ends up being more nuanced than these statements might imply, not least because of a Foucauldian perspective which is necessarily critical of the practices concerned as just another twist in the ratchet of 'technologies of the self'. In any event, we are definitely arriving at a more sustained engagement with sociologies of religion/spirituality than we perhaps anticipated, at the same time as digging deeper for inspiration in our own disciplinary (geographical) treatments of religion, spirituality and (post-)secularisation.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We acknowledge that our project has been principally orientated towards the academic community, but it certainly does have a potential importance outside of academia. Through the poster display at Brighton Jubilee Library and also versions of the final report tailored for our collaborating 'new-spiritual' organisations, we have disseminated our findings/conclusions to a wider audience. Our research is potentially of value, then, in speaking back to these organisations about the lives, experiences, attitudes, hopes and fears of yoga/meditation practitioners in the city, as well as revealing useful information about how these practitioners 'fit' classes/sessions into their busy daily schedules - possibly suggesting ways of improving the availability of 'services'.

Our research also discloses how much the likes of yoga/meditation are valued by practitioners as sources of physical and mental well-being, offering empirical evidence to confirm the appropriateness of moves to bring such practices more fully into alignment with national health strategies (for instance, by continuing to introduce 'mindfulness' into mental health therapies and broader terrains of counselling). Conversely, there are warnings here about cutting-back on such practices in public sector provision if they are seen as 'soft options' with scant concrete data on 'effectiveness', given that they are clearly seen as a vital alternative where more conventional biomedical and psychological treatments appear to be failing. A further practical lesson, which ought to be more fully heeded by companies, politicians, even urban planners/designers, is that efforts should be made to create dedicated times and spaces for yogic, meditative and related activities, as 'oases' of calm - but also energising and rejuvenation - within the maelstrom of busy urban daily routines. Arguably, there is a lesson here about how we should be recalibrating the pace, multi-facets and sensory overload of the contemporary urban realm, so as to allow time-space for 'new-spiritual practices' to breathe. 
 
There are strong messages emerging from the research that the advocates/managers of formal religions, especially but not exclusively Christianity, should arguably be less dismissive about an assumed fickle approach to spirituality pursued by practitioners such as our participant, Our research reveals that there appears to be much that is genuine in the questing for alternatives to secular individualism/materialism, hence arguably signifying less a hollowing out of the UK's spiritual commitments, more their diversification, recombination, even hybridisation. True, challenges are being waved at adherence to the simplicities of authoritarian spiritual direction, with salutary lessons for those who cling to older certainties, perhaps even denouncing the kinds of practices under study here as 'devilry'; but, at the same time, practitioners may still be finding meaning and inner strength (replete with major inner-self transformations) from the established religions, which they do not necessarily see as antithetical to their favoured practices. Moreover, these practitioners do not always see that incommensurability of different strains of religion/spirituality that is often taken-for-granted in wider public discourse (and even, for that matter, in the sociologies of religion/spirituality); and we reckon that our own geographical perspective, with its inherent openness to 'differences' played out and re-assembled across the spaces of the city, is helpful in permitting an openness to this rejection of incommensurability as lived (if rarely articulated as such).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>2A16C25B-498C-418D-99C7-C520AFA40AB6</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54635fcdb99e25.15857343</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Environment,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://spiritualitiesresearch.wordpress.com/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Time-geography, popular in the 1970s and 1980s, has largely fallen out of favour within the academic discipline of geography, or at least within those more critical and cultural quarters hesitant about certain 'technical' (measuring, mapping, 'geovisualising') ways that time-geography has since been recast in the likes of urban and regional analysis. Even so, in the last few years and encouraged by the 'practice turn' in human geography, there has been some re-interest in its method (for example, Latham 2003, 2004; Thrift 2006). At its most basic level, time geography pivots on the apparently banal notion that, for humans to exist and act in the world, they must move through time and across space (Philo et al 1991). Rather than mere containers for social action, time and space are central to what people do, or are unable to do, in their daily life (and hence longer-run life-course). Much time-geography concerns the structural and biological factors that constrain individuals from doing certain things, including: physical constraints (one cannot inhabit two places at the same time, humans need to eat and sleep), coupling constraints (individuals are required to come together at certain times and in certain spaces, such as through work or school), and authority constraints (rules and regulations limiting access to certain spaces). Nonetheless, also integral to time-geography is an alertness to the relative openess of the future: to the possibilities opened up rather than closed down by what individuals are enabled to access during their time-space journeying - sometimes through chance encounters, other times through intended meetings and activities - with all manner of often unpredictable consequences for what one knows, understands, believes, intuits and feels.
 
In the first instance, we felt that a simplified version of a time-space diary might assist us in gathering some basic data on the activities of individuals on the days that they practised yoga or meditation. By covering aspects such as where they practised, what times they practised, how often they practised and for how long, we could arrive at a picture of how people 'fit' yogic or meditative practices into their (busy) everyday schedules. A key problem with time-geography remains, which is that it neatly packaged individuals into largely disembodied, rational and autonomous subjects, choosing their activities within the limits of certain constraints (their space-time budgets, social structures, transport costs: Rose 1993). Ironically, then, for a method which centers space, the actual effects of occupying space on individuals' subjectivities or of individuals' subjectivities on the fashioning of space still remain relatively unexplored. For us, rather than see space and time as mere resources, and hence quantifiable into space-time budgets, we wanted to consider the effects that yoga and meditation hold for how individuals' inhabit space-time (where inhabitation indexes an expanded, phenomenological sense of 'dwelling'). For example, we were interested in the extent to which the practices - for both bodily and mental well-being; for being able to cope and even to excel in the world - may have resonances throughout an individuals' day and across a multitude of other sites and activities. We felt that such a spatialisation could play a crucial role in dismantling the a prioris found in much intellectual work in the sociologies and geographies of religion and spirituality - such as the (spatial) division between scared and profane, religious and secular, and authentic and inauthentic.
 
To achieve this outcome required a little adaption, and to some extent simplification, of the time-space diary method, which was achieved in three ways. First, by offering a column in the diary for reflection, we broadened the focus to allow for the emotional aspects of new spiritualities to be considered (see Figure 2). Second, we instructed the diarist that the diary template which we had provided was indeed only loosely formatted, presenting our diarists with different examples of how the diary may be completed. Some of these examples focussed on accurately recording what happened in each time segment; others offered greater reflection on individuals' thoughts and feelings during the day, having them cut across different time-frames. In so doing, we sought to incorporate the possibility for differing temporalities of new spiritual practices, ones which moved beyond the linear time-space paths and bounded time-space budgets found in earlier time geography diagrams. Third, and to follow from an earlier point, diaries, like in-depth interviews, are constructed rewritings or re-tellings of the social world. Rather than see this as a hindrance to research, however, we wanted to harness its potential; and so, along with analysing the reflected meanings that individuals had about yoga, meditation and their daily life, we were also interested in the gaps, hesitancies, incoherencies and contradictions that may appear through the diary format and in the subsequent interview. Such an attunement, we felt, would potentially question research on religion and spirituality that presupposes fixed (in time and space) and fully coherent (perfectly transparent and knowable) religious or spiritual identities and experiences. 

The time-space diary template contained a column for diarists to reflect on key activities during their day; a column to indicate location; and a column to reflect on practices of yoga or meditation (such as how it fitted into their day, whether it impacted on their day, and whether they enjoyed it). We asked individuals to complete five entries for days when they practised yoga or meditation, or both, which they could do so in paper or electronic format (we provided an electronic version on a memory stick) or, if they wished, using a format of their own choice (for example, a blog entry). We additionally asked individuals to furnish some basic background information about themselves, as detailed or vague as they preferred, and also to offer some initial self-assessment regarding aspects of their lives that they considered germane to their own yogic or meditative practise. Intriguingly, some offered remarkable reflections on the history of their own spiritual questing, their relationship (often conflicted) with established religions and versions of divinity, and their personal circumstances in terms of health, employment, partners and the like. These materials were then invaluable for shaping the follow-up interviews, offering the interviewer (Cadman) a variety of entry-points for inquiring into the diverse contexts - within a biography, of places lived and visited, of past religious-spiritual experiences and learning, and so forth - clearly playing through into an individual's current 'situation'. The interviewer ensured that she was familiar with said materials, but also with the details of an interviewee's time-space diary, thereby facilitating the asking of questions designed to 'get in-depth' with the nuances of an individual's practices within the processural dynamics of their routine time-space movements - the warp and weft of how they inhabited the city and its constituent places (neighbourhoods, parks, seafronts, shops, caf&amp;eacute;s, health centres, yoga studios, meditation centres, and so on). As such, the method was indeed the diary plus interview, the ideal being that the two would work creatively and informatively off one another.</gtr:description><gtr:id>81B9757E-A9D9-4C7A-8C70-C66915D04694</gtr:id><gtr:impact>There seemed to be a lot of interest in this method when presented at meetings of the AHRC 'Religion and Society' programme, and we have been asked to provide a chapter on our method for a forthcoming volume on Methods in Religious Research, edited by Linda Woodhead (the Programme Director): see publication details elsewhere.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54636543f1d8a3.18183830</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Time-space diaries for research on 'new spiritualities' or related subject-matters</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F0DDB886-5939-4025-BF53-EC83B5623C11</gtr:id><gtr:title>Changing the habits of a lifetime?
