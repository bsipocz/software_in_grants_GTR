The answers to the individual questions are treated as indicators of latent (unobserved) constructs such as respondents' skills, beliefs, attitudes or state of health. Often the interest is on how the aforementioned constructs are related to each other and to covariates also measured in the surveys. The results of data analysis are often used by policy makers, educators and economists and are of interest to the general public. 

There is a well-established modelling framework called latent variable modelling (LVM), or structural equation modelling (SEM), for the analysis of such social data. However, the standard statistical methods for estimation and inference in LVM and SEM are often not computationally feasible for large problems. This has led to the use of ad hoc approaches, but even these have computational limitations under certain conditions. As a feasible alternative, the project proposes the use of pairwise likelihood (PL) because it is computationally practical, shows good statistical properties and there is a sound theoretical background to support it. 

There are three main methodological objectives of the project. The first is to study the performance of PL under realistic conditions, i.e. whether accurate and reliable results are obtained when the model size and complexity and the data type match those encountered in real applications. The performance of PL will also be compared with the existing approaches using both simulated data and the PIAAC (Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies) and ESS (European Social Survey) data. The second goal is to develop, within the SEM and PL framework, methodology for assessing the goodness-of-fit of a hypothesized model and for selecting among competing models. The proposed methods will be compared with their counterparts developed under the existing approaches. The third objective is to extend the models to handle non-ignorable item nonresponse within the SEM and PL framework. Omitting cases with item non-response can affect the reliability and validity of data analysis and subsequently the conclusions. All methodological advances will be general enough to cover the cases of both continuous and categorical (ordinal, binary, and ranking) data.

Variables from the PIAAC and ESS survey data will be analysed using the proposed methods to demonstrate their potential and to answer the main research questions posed by researchers who designed these surveys. These include cross-national comparisons of adult skills (PIAAC) and public trust in criminal justice and criteria for immigrants to enter a country (ESS). 

The overarching aim is to keep a good balance between statistical theory and practice. For this, any methodological development will be &amp;quot;translated&amp;quot; to practical statistical tools readily available to researchers and practitioners to facilitate the analysis of their own data. The proposed techniques and tools will be accessible through the free open source R package lavaan. Online manuals and tutorials will explain when and how the proposed approaches can be used. These will give computing instructions and illustrative examples of data analysis, as well as discussing the interpretation of the results. 

The methodological and substantive findings of the project will be disseminated through academic publications and presentations at seminars and international conferences. The exact means within these communication channels will be carefully selected in order to reach statisticians, social researchers from both academic and non-academic environments, and practitioners such as educators, psychometricians, policy makers.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Social scientists who conduct quantitative research and anyone who employs latent variable modelling (LVM) or structural equation modelling (SEM) are the main beneficiaries of the project. This group includes both academic and non-academic (public, private and voluntary sector) researchers. In particular, non-academic researchers often lack access to state-of-the-art techniques in LVM and SEM, especially when data are of a categorical nature. They will be provided with new easily-accessible statistical tools for the analysis of survey data, including data from cross-national surveys. These tools will be implemented in free software R. Online documentation and tutorials will aim to train any potential user to apply the new methods effectively and interpret the results correctly. The use of the proposed pairwise likelihood (PL) estimation will enable them to fit more complex models to any type of data without losing accuracy and efficiency compared to the existing methods. Researchers will also be given tools for testing the fit of the models, selecting among models, and treating item non-response as part of the general model framework. Moreover, substantial knowledge will be added to the field of analysis of ranking data which is under-researched. Hence, research building on the outputs of the project is facilitated and the project has the potential to influence professional practice. The benefit, in turn, will be an improvement in the quality of the information produced by quantitative researchers.

Policy makers, educators and in general consumers of research who draw on analyses of PIAAC (Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies) and ESS (European Social Survey) data will be another group of &amp;quot;users&amp;quot; of the project's outputs. The project aims to analyze the aforementioned data to answer fundamental research questions which were set when these surveys were designed. As stated on the OECD website, the evidence from PIAAC data &amp;quot;will help countries better understand how education and training systems can nurture these skills. Educators, policy makers and labour economists will use this information to develop economic, education and social policies.&amp;quot; Regarding the ESS, data on &amp;quot;Trust in criminal justice&amp;quot; and on criteria for entry of immigrants to a country will be analyzed. The analysis of trust in criminal justice will extend previous analyses which are either of a simple descriptive nature or are restricted to only a subset of the data. The results of the analysis will inform evaluation of criminal justice policies and policies to foster public compliance with the law. The second ESS study, on immigration, will be conducted in a different way to conventional analyses. The data will be treated as ranking data instead of ordinal in order to avoid the limitations of the latter and reveal more information about the subject. Therefore, researchers will be aware of different types of data analysis. Overall, the project will contribute to evidence-based policy making and may influence public policies.

The collaboration with ETS will help to develop a better understanding of the needs of organizations that are involved in educational assessment. Educational assessment is widely used to evaluate and measure skills, knowledge and effects of training. It is also used by companies and the public sector for recruitment. The methodology used for designing and calibrating the tests is LVM. Fast and reliable estimation and testing methods are therefore very much in demand.

Users of R software, especially those who use the psychometrics packages, will also benefit from the intended software output. This group grows constantly and rapidly and is very diverse in its composition. It includes academics at all levels of seniority, package developers, researchers in non-academic organizations, statisticians at all levels of expertise, and students of all fields who are taught quantitative methods of research.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>189447</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Ghent</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Belgium, Kingdom of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Data Analysis</gtr:department><gtr:description>Collaboration with Prof Rosseel to implement PL method in lavaan</gtr:description><gtr:id>CD849395-7725-4EC6-9ECF-922DE26AAC96</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This collaboration helped me to study the performance of PLRT in realistic models and conditions through a simulation study.

The test of nested models that has been developed helps practitioners to choose among competing models. These tests have been tested in real-application conditions and they work well; they are used to assess models fitted to data from European Social Survey (Round 5) on &amp;quot;Trust in the Police and Courts&amp;quot;. The proposed tests are extensions to certain well-established standard test statistics, hence they are easy to use and interpret. Another key finding is that the pairwise likelihood versions of AIC and PL-BIC model selection criteria work well in real-application conditions. These criteria also inform the task of choosing among competing models.

Pairwise likelihood estimation is extended to the case of missing data, i.e. the method is appropriately adapted so that all data at hand can be used to estimate a hypothesized model; in other words even cases with missing values for variables that are meant to be measured are included in the estimation process. Such an approach enhances the stability of estimation, decreases uncertainty of inference, and can decrease bias. Five different adaptations of PL have developed and studied in real-application conditions to conclude that the &amp;quot;naive&amp;quot;, less sophisticated, and more practical ones (complete-pairs PL and available-case PL) work very well with respect to statistical criteria (i.e. standardised bias of estimates, root mean square error of estimates, coverage rate of the 95% confidence interval, and bias of standard errors). The &amp;quot;naive&amp;quot; PL estimators are competitive to a well-established estimation method (multiple imputation diagonally weighted least squares - MIDWLS) with respect to the statistical criteria with the further advantage that they do not require any further assumptions than the standard ones about the model of the data at hand. On contrary, MIDWLS makes assumptions on what the missing values could be by incorporating a predictive model. This renders the results sensitive to potential misspecifications of the predictive model. Moreover, it is straightforward to extend the fit statistics for assessing models to the case of the &amp;quot;naive&amp;quot; PL estimators for missing data while it is not the case with MIDWLS. The proposed methodology is used to analyse OECD data from the Survey of Adult skills (known as PIAAC data).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The aforementioned tests, model selection criteria, estimation methods incorporating data with missing values are available to public through the open source software R and the R package lavaan. Hence, anyone who analyzes ordinal variables using structural equation models can use the proposed estimation and inference tools. Moreover, having access to the code enables researchers to adapt the test to other modelling frameworks of interest. The proposed methodology has been used to analyse data from European Social Survey and OECD data encouraging the practitioners to adopt the new methodology.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8465E787-5126-4800-AB5B-612FB7D963DC</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56ddcb151ba369.10930369</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Structural equation models with ordinal variables are used mainly in Behavioral Sciences to measure attitudes, beliefs, skills, status (e.g. social, health, etc.), and any other concept of similar type.
