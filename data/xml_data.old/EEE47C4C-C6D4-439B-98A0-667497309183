modelling towards personalized treatment of the injured brain.</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/K041207/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The brain, more than any other organ in the body, requires a constant supply of blood in order to maintain its function. When blood pressure drops, small arteries dilate to restore flow levels, and when pressure rises, they constrict to protect the most delicate blood vessels and avoid bleeding in the brain. This control system can however become impaired for example following stroke, head trauma, in dementia or following premature birth and this has been associated with worse outcomes for the patient. Failure of the control system also has important implications for the management of patient's blood pressure: changes in blood pressure could be dangerous without the protection of this 'autoregulatory' system.
This project aims to improve methods for measuring cerebral autoregulation and to gain a deeper understanding of the complex relationship between blood pressure and blood flow in healthy individuals and patients following stroke. While much work has been done in this field, experimental and technical challenges in assessing the control function has so far led to only limited benefit to patients. The control system is highly complex and, typical of such biological systems, there are multiple complementary physiological mechanisms working in parallel. There are indications that even in healthy individuals there are differences in the manner and the extent to which they control the flow. Impairment may also affect different mechanisms to a varying extent in different individuals. This has important implications for grading an individual's autoregulation, as the conventional approach, based on a single number to quantifying the strength of autoregulation, is likely to be inadequate. 
This project sets out in a new direction for the field, by focussing on the diversity of ways in which brain blood flow may operate in different individuals, rather than studying average group behaviour, which has so far been the predominant approach. It also breaks new ground methodologically by integrating the study of blood flow control with that of blood pressure control, based on the complementary roles these have in ensuring that the brain receives sufficient blood.
We will thus investigate a sample of healthy volunteers in detail. We will repeatedly record blood pressure and flow, heart-rate and carbon dioxide levels during spontaneous fluctuations at rest, and during challenges in a range of protocols (periodic squatting, raising the upper body of volunteers, applying random pressure changes to a cuff around the thighs, breathing air with 5% CO2). Using advanced data analysis methods (signal processing and mathematical modelling), some of which will be developed and optimized as part of this project, we will quantify the simultaneous control of blood pressure and flow and aim to identify characteristic differences between individuals and sub-groups. 
Building on the differences observed in the healthy subjects, we will also study a group of patients during the first days and weeks after they have suffered a stroke. We aim to quantify the impairments in blood flow and blood pressure control, with a view to improving understanding of the evolution of this condition, and how this might impact the management of their blood pressure in the acute and chronic phase. Correct functioning of these control systems is thought to be key in making effective clinical decisions, but currently there are no clear guidelines due to a lack of understanding of the impairments in each individual patient and also the methods for their measurement.
The overarching aim of this multicentre and multidisciplinary project is thus to lay the foundations for a personalized approach to managing blood pressure control after stroke, based on characterising individuals' blood pressure and flow control, and thus to protect patients' brains from further damage.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-03-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>321710</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Santiago, Chile</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Chile, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Santiago Collaboration</gtr:description><gtr:id>2B9FAB56-7B73-4701-9BF4-4D00542CFE9B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This is a multidisciplinary collaboration between Stroke physicians, Biomedical Scientists, experts in mathematics, physics and computer modelling.

A new Research Associate has been appointed. They have continued to meet the objectives of the project, including:
1. REC and Trust approvals for the Leicester component of the project related to Stroke patients and healthy controls.
2. Website development.
3. Database development.
4. Investigator meetings to ensure uniformity in study protocol, and data collection and analysis.
5. Healthy volunteer and patient recruitment.
6. Generation of scientific outputs from the database (recorded in the publications section).

A full report on the project progress in Leicester, Oxford and Southampton will be provided by Professor David Simpson for the Lead Institution, University of Southampton.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The brain, more than any other organ in the body, requires a constant supply of blood in order to maintain its function. When blood pressure drops, small arteries increase in size to restore flow levels, and when pressure rises, they narrow to protect the most delicate blood vessels and avoid bleeding and swelling in the brain. Failure of this control system (called cerebral autoregulation) following brain injury can lead to worse outcomes, and also influence the management of changes in blood pressure. This project aims to improve methods for measuring cerebral autoregulation and to gain a deeper understanding of the complex relationship between blood pressure and blood flow in healthy individuals as well as in patients following stroke. 

We are actively recruiting all patients providing consent (or legal representative consent), as soon as possible after stroke onset, undertaking six assessments of blood pressure, heart rate, and brain blood flow in total. These assessments will be taken at rest, and in response to movement of the arm and during breathing a 5% concentration of carbon dioxide (the body's waste gas). Up to 5 of these assessments will be in the acute stroke phase, up to 72 hours from stroke onset (at 9, 12, 24 and 48 hours, depending on how soon after stroke you were admitted). The last two assessments will carried out in the subacute phase (within 2 weeks) and in the chronic phase (at 3 months after your stroke). 

By recruiting all patients, i.e. having very few reasons to exclude patients, we aim to quantify all impairments in blood flow and blood pressure control using advanced data analysis methods, with a view to improving understanding of how this might impact on the management of an individual patient's blood pressure in the acute and chronic phases following stroke. In turn, this will impact on the future treatment of this common clinical problem in acute stroke.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>43E7BA1D-433D-4CBB-A787-0159D51B2E42</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545a182d08abb8.25067915</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>We have a longstanding research interest in cerebral haemodynamics in health and disease, including stroke, in Leicester.
