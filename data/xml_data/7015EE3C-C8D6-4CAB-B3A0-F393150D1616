By 1914 its establishment was 240,000 men and women, representing just under one third of the entire UK civil service, distributed nationwide in c. 24,000 offices. Although a diffuse network of activities, the Post Office operated a common national wage structure and conditions of service, superannuation system, and over time, a competitive appointment process. It was also the first part of the public sector to have its own Medical Officer, dating from 1855, and to subject its employees to medical examination on appointment to and on discharge from duty. As a centralised bureaucracy subject to both Treasury and (on occasion) Home Office control, the Post Office maintained remarkably full and comprehensive records of its personnel. Yet these employment records have never been used systematically to investigate some recurrent problems of Victorian political and social history on which they might throw a clearer light. Firstly, as a continuous and expanding organisation across the late 18th and19th centuries the Post Office is a unique case-study for measuring government growth, or what has conventionally been called the 'revolution in government', whereby an older aristocratic system of amateur and nepotistic departmental management gave way to 'modern' civil service procedures based on expertise, some time around the decades following the Northcote-Trevelyan report of 1853. Secondly, the Post Office establishment is a significantly large sample of 19th century men and women whose personal data relating to health, income and savings might generate new quantitative and qualitative information about the standards of living in Victorian Britain. The two PhDs for which funding is sought in this project will look at the employment culture of the Victorian Post Office in two specific areas: first, the shift from patronage to competitive examination in the appointment of staff between the 1830s and the 1880s; and secondly, standards of health and welfare, and conditions of pay and service, enjoyed by Post Office employees across the 19th century, but with particular emphasis on the decades after 1855. The first project will use the large run of material in POST 1 (Treasury correspondence) and POST 57 (Staff recruitment) to examine how post office appointments were made in the period before the introduction of competitive examination. Appointment by more disinterested means had certainly become the norm by the 1890s, but how and when is not clear. Historians have investigated similar shifts from favour to merit in other parts of Victorian government, notably, the Admiralty, the Army and the Church of England, but the Post Office has not been subjected to the same questions, and since as an institution it reached further into ordinary society and most localities, the findings could be very revealing. The second PhD will use the series of employment records at POST 58-66 to study the social and economic conditions of the Victorian Post Office workforce, looking particularly at the wages, hours and health of employees, as well as the distinctive pension system of the organisation. If it proves possible to create meaningful longitudinal datasets based on the medical records of the Post Office employees, the PhD will take on a more quantitative nature, adding a new case-study to the expanding research on fitness, nutrition, morbidity and standards of living during industrialisation provided by similar data from criminal and military records, and from the records of friendly societies. If the Post Office personnel data is not robust enough for such a study, then this project will look more generally and descriptively at the welfare state in miniature suggested by the evolution over the second half of the 19th century of the P</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project will be primarily aimed at academic users and at the visitors and research groups associated with the BPMA. At the IHR there will be an end of project colloquium on 'The Victorian Post Office', with a possible edited volume as a result. Both students will be encouraged to give papers on their work at IHR seminars and elsewhere, including the annual Economic History Society conference, and to submit articles based on their research to relevant peer-reviewed journals, such as the Historical Journal, Historical Research, Parliamentary History, and the Economic History Review. They will also be expected to give talks about the project to non-specialist audiences, as guided by the BPMA. Under the Project Partner details a full list of exhibition activities related to the project are also described.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-02-05</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-01-04</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>120500</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I025018/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
