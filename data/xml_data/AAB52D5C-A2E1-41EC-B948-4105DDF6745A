The aim of the proposed work is to determine the feasibility of using a NERC-developed instrument (ApRES) to aid the management of water resources in arid and semi-arid regions by allowing water-table depths to be monitored without recourse to boreholes. The challenge has both technical and societal aspects.

The Autonomous phase-sensitive Radio Echo Sounder (ApRES) was jointly developed by the British Antarctic Survey and University College London to monitor the changing thickness of the floating portion of the Antarctic Ice Sheet. Lightweight, robust and relatively inexpensive, ApRES was designed to be deployed on an ice sheet for a year or more, withstanding the harsh conditions of the Antarctic winter.

The problem of detecting the changing depth of the base of an ice sheet is essentially the same as that of detecting the depth of the water table in an otherwise dry environment. ApRES can therefore potentially be used as relatively inexpensive (compared with boreholes) method for monitoring the depth of the water table, providing a tool to assist in the management of water abstraction.

Our choice of country for this study is Morocco. Morocco boasts a useful range of soil types, climatic conditions, and water table depths. Its many boreholes provide the necessary ground truth by offering an independent measure of the depth of the water table.

A short pilot study was undertaken in Morocco in March 2017, funded through a NERC ODA Innovation pump-prime grant, and locally facilitated by the partners on the present proposal. The results were promising. Several sites were visited, with varying water table depths, primarily to find a suitable location for a multi-hour deployment. The instrument was able to detect the water table at most of the sites and was able to monitor its changing depth over a 6-hour (overnight) trial.

The promising results from the pilot now prompts the next step - a comprehensive study in Morocco, alongside our Moroccan partners, to determine more precisely the envelope of capability of the instrument, and to reduce impediments to its use in monitoring groundwater depth: ease of use, robustness, cost. In the proposed study visits to different field sites in Morocco will allow the utility of ApRES to be assessed for a range of soil types, soil moisture contents, water table depths, local conditions (urban/rural) and seasons (wet/dry). The instrument and antennas will be scrutinised to see where costs can be reduced and what hardening will be needed to deal with the non-polar conditions. Finally, the data-processing steps will be rationalised such that a non-expert could carry them out.

The societal aspect of the challenge, how to ensure uptake of any new technique, will be addressed in two ways. An independently resourced, but parallel study that we have instigated (to be delivered by Development i-Teams in October and November 2017) will investigate how having the ability to monitor the discharge and recharge of aquifers in real time can be used to improve the sustainability of groundwater exploitation in water-scarce regions. Second, our project partners in Morocco will prepare an implementation pathways document to define how the technology could be rolled out in Morocco. Should the project that we are proposing here confirm the technical feasibility of using ApRES for ground water monitoring in arid regions, the outcomes of the i-Teams study and the implementation pathways report will put us in a strong position to take the project forward to the next level of application, both within Morocco and beyond.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who might benefit from this project?

The ultimate beneficiaries of the project are water users such as communities, farmers and industries suffering as a result of groundwater management that is hindered by not knowing the day-to-day state of the groundwater levels. One of the principal technical difficulties faced by water basin managers, whether they are government agencies or farm cooperatives, is that groundwater is a resource that is essentially invisible, and that the negative effects of over-abstraction often become obvious only when wells run dry. The water users will benefit when implementation of our ApRES groundwater monitoring will lead to water management decisions that will protect the long-term sustainability of this precious resource. Maintaining this resource will also benefit wildlife and ecosystems, which in turn will have economic benefits through e.g. encouraging tourism industry. The beneficiaries will in the first instance be located in Morocco, where our field work will take place and where we would expect adoption to occur first. We will also put mechanism in place that pave the way for adaptation/adoption of the technology in other (semi)arid DAC-listed countries, targeting first African countries with Climate Innovation Centres (Kenya, Ethiopia, Ghana, South Africa), who are linked to our Project Partner Morocco Climate Innovation Centre.

The more direct beneficiaries will be water basin managers in Morocco, as a result of the engagement catalysed by our Moroccan Project Partners.

How might they benefit from this project?

The project is proving and refining a technique for groundwater level monitoring, where none exists today, short of by drilling boreholes. The project is also a study of how to implement the technique, both in Morocco and beyond. It will not in itself create a network of monitoring stations, but it will point out how technical and societal impediments to such a network can be addressed. The project will hence pave the way, both in terms of technology development, and implementation plan for the technology once proven, for water managers to gain visibility of the previously hidden status of groundwater levels. This will aid evidence-based decision making to protect groundwater resources from over-exploitation and achieve long-term sustainability.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>102408</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/R009589/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6E910789-6B8D-4B73-B5B0-F3156942B558</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Geosciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6BF947B0-8E6E-48DB-AB68-7130938F2DF2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Instrument. sensor &amp; detectors</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EDE0586F-810A-4956-BC26-74CA0D6759F6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Hydrogeology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>189E1F60-BF95-405D-A6F0-62BBD78E2DD5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Survey &amp; Monitoring</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
