&lt;p>It will investigate the number and tonnage of English ships in service, the size and social composition of maritime communities (ship masters and seafarers), and the distribution of available vessels and manpower by region and port; and it will seek to establish how and why the merchant fleet changed over time, in response to forces associated with the Hundred Years War, successive visitations of the Black Death and trade competition. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>Foundational for the compilation of statistics, and of considerable interest in its own right, will be the piecing together of career profiles for both ship masters and individual ships, the latter casting light for the first time on the working lives of sea-going vessels. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>The most important sources for the project are the voluminous and finely detailed records that document the privately-owned ships that were requisitioned by the crown in wartime, principally to transport armies and supplies and to patrol the seas. These 'naval' data will be computerised and combined with compatible material from trade and taxation records.&lt;br />&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-10-03</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-04-04</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>77069</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>A voyage into the unknown : can we really know the size of the English merchant fleet in the fourteenth century?

The majority of these voyages concern English vessels. Adding these newly collected data to what had already been assembled brings the overall total of documented 'voyages' to 16,000, undertaken by nearly 6,600 ships and about 5,600 shipmasters. These should be regarded as interim findings, subject to change as new evidence is uncovered and as the core dataset is correlated with other sources to flesh out the working lives and circumstances of ships and masters.

Our findings concerning the geographical distribution and overall size of the merchant fleet are also necessarily provisional. That as many as 200 English coastal and estuarine communities provided vessels and crews for the king's fleets at least once during this period has permitted us to examine regional shipping patterns and to compare and contextualise ports of all sizes. For those ports that were regularly called upon to contribute ships and men, the naval records provide an unrivalled guide to maritime resources.

Estimates of the size of the merchant fleet depend upon interpretation of 'snap shots' of surviving data from periods of intense and well-documented naval activity. Thus, during the years 1338 to 1342 we find evidence of 866 ships (from 97 ports) in the naval records, which grows to 1,009 when vessels visible only in the commercial sphere are added. Assessment of evidence 'internal' to this sample, combined with an allowance for vessels involved in coastal trade and fishing, suggests that the pre-Black Death merchant fleet consisted of about 3,000 to 4,000 ships. Concentrations of data from 1359 and the 1370s indicate that the population collapse caused by recurrent plague outbreaks was not accompanied by significant shrinkage in shipping capacity or maritime manpower.

About a quarter of our 5,600 identified shipmasters can be associated with two or more documented voyages. By matching these career data with other sources, including taxpayer lists, we have begun to explore the socio-economic world of the shipmaster. So much had been anticipated. Altogether more surprising is the potential revealed for prosopographical investigation of the ordinary mariner. We have discovered dozens of crew lists in the naval records, including about forty from the 1370s and '80s: lists of mariners that can be compared with the poll tax returns of 1377-81 and other records of local provenance. Regarding crew sizes and mariner demography: our initial working hypothesis, that ships used as army transports had commercial-level crews, has been confirmed. This has important implications for our understanding of the size and composition of England's maritime workforce, as does what we now know of the supplemented, armed crews on ships assigned a fighting role. Comparison of crew and muster lists has revealed considerable flexibility, with men serving interchangeably as mariners or shipboard fighting men.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>1. Exploitation of the data assembled during the term of the project: a database ('Shipping, mariners and ports in fourteenth-century England') has been deposited in the UK Data Service: http://discover.ukdataservice.ac.uk/catalogue/?sn=850665&amp;amp;type=Data%20catalogue

The database provides details of over 10,000 'voyages' undertaken by English ships and crews during the period 1320-1400. Where possible, the following categories of information for each voyage have been collected and entered into the database: ship's home port; ship name; ship type and tonnage; ship master's name; crew size: numbers of each category of personnel and overall total; date(s) of the voyage; source reference. Additional fields, intended as refinements and aids to analysis, have been created (i) to identify and locate the ships' home ports; (ii) to standardise ship names and masters' surnames (the latter to make the reconstruction of their careers easier); and (iii) to classify the voyages according to the broad categories of sources material used and the nature of the voyage itself. There are 28 fields in the database.

The contribution to research (by amateur local and regional historians, as well as university-based professionals) that this database can make is not yet measurable, but its potential will be immediately evident.


2. Consultation of the project team's publications will provide access not only to the detailed findings of the project, but also the methologies that have been developed, which could have wider application. For example, the project's first published article, 'The mariner in fourteenth-century England (in Fourteenth Century England, VII, ed. W.M. Ormrod) proposes a quantitative and prosopographical approach to the study of the shipboard community, the approach being reliant on combined use of naval and commercial taxation records, and the matching of these 'voyage records' with socio-economic evidence (particularly lists of taxpayers) at local level. The extent and characteristics of aggregated national-level data are discussed, and the potential of these sources and methodologies for the investigation of shipmasters is demonstrated through specific case studies concerning Hull and King's Lynn, and the ports of Dorset and the Colne estuary in Essex.

Future publications will examine the sources and methodologies required for the quantitative investigation of the fourteenth-century English merchant fleet, with quantitative findings relating to numbers and tonnage of ships, the size of the mariner workforce, the national distribution of shipping and manpower, and change and continuities over time.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>BE736BB4-816B-4FA3-ACA7-76FA053C379A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-5231245593.383205b2f2bb08</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>A database of voyages undertaken by English shipping and seamen during an eighty-year period (1320-1400), drawing on (i) naval and transportation fleet records (1361-1400) and (ii) commercial taxation records (1320-1400) held by the National Archives, British Library and Devon Record Office.

Each record in the database relates to a single 'voyage' by a single ship, such a 'voyage' being defined as the appearance of a ship in a source that either (i) documents a period of naval service or trading activity, or (ii) records the existence of the vessel at a specific moment in time (e.g. on a ship list drawn up for administrative purposes). There are 10,289 records in the database.
