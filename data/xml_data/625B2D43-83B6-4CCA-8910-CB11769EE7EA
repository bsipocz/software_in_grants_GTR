What do we remember about the books we have read (as a child, on the tube, on holiday), and why? Reading is often experienced as a private activity, which takes place in silence, on one's own. Yet reading groups have grown immensely in popularity over the past two decades, bringing reading experiences into the public domain. In what ways do we share our memories of reading?

This project is interested in both individual and collective memories of reading fiction. It will firstly set up an oral history archive of interviews with members of local reading groups, to explore memories as described in individual life stories. In doing so, the project will provide a new kind of resource - differing from the numerous interviews carried out with authors, from oral history interviews (for the 'Authors' Lives' archive at the British Library) to radio and other interviews by journalists, literary critics, fans and other readers. By turning to readers themselves, the project will make available new material enabling insights into memories of fiction and life stories. How are memories of books associated with particular experiences and emotions? How do readers make use of fiction in their life stories?

One thing that is interesting about reading groups is that they turn written text into group talk, turning back the clock from literacy to orality, from the act of the individual reading to talking, from the solitary experience to the social. Scholars of book history often note how reading became an increasingly private activity over the course of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, due in part to the rise in literacy, but book groups interestingly highlight the social potential of reading. Thus the project is concerned not only with individual memories but also with how memories of fiction are exchanged with others. After working with individual interviewees, the project researchers will thus work in the reading groups. Having identified clusters of books recalled across a number of interviews, these books, and memories of them, will then be discussed in groups. We are interested in how these shared memories compare to individual recollections. In what ways can group talk change how we remember fiction?

The project will challenge assumptions that reading is merely a private, personal activity. It will consider how reading and storying the self may be related, establishing how individual memories can be shared and related to a wider social and historical context. 

The project's findings will be of interest not only to individual academics but to reading groups themselves. We will disseminate the research through academic publications and also through public talks, a learning resource and website. As well as providing access to the interviews, the website will provide information and other material including the learning resource, which will outline our methodology for other reading groups to take up and develop, and a forum through which these groups can respond and feed back into the project. The project will thereby provide a hub of activity to foster wider discussions and ongoing reflection about how we remember fiction.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project's activities will most immediately benefit members of local reading groups. By interviewing readers in the process of research the project involves these members in the project from the outset. Through this process we expect to stimulate interest in the project and to encourage readers to reflect in new ways on their reading experiences and memories. By then further encouraging reflection through the reading group discussions, and through the public talks in libraries, we expect to enhance social exchange and encourage book group members - and wider audiences - to reflect on their memories of reading and on its social potential.

The availability of the archive not only at the University of Roehampton but also Wandsworth library will allow participants to readily access their own materials while also being open to the wider public. To encourage wider interest in the project we plan to publicise it in local media and beyond. As well as the reading group discussions, and the library talks, the seminar series and parts of the conference will also be open to the public and podcasts made available. Publicity is not simply for the purpose of disseminating our research, however, but also to encourage participation. By providing a learning resource through the project website, to enable other reading groups to take up (and potentially develop) our methodology and to feed back into the website, we will both broaden out beyond the local district to reading groups nationally and internationally, and also further contribute to a two-way process of exchange between researchers and readers.

For library users and the wider community, we expect the project's activities to generate interest in reading groups, possibly increasing membership and stimulating new groups, but also to change their character by introducing the question of memory. The benefits of reading groups to many participants are increasingly well established. The Reading Agency claims, for example, that reading group membership supports learning, promotes cultural understanding, and equalizes access to cultural activity (see http://readingagency.org.uk/about/Programme_for_reading_groups.pdf). 

Our research can also be of benefit to libraries, which are often key to the formation and support of reading groups, by enabling libraries to better understand their users and how they engage with reading in social as well as individual contexts. In particular, in the current climate of threat to public libraries, we want our work to highlight and valorize them as unique public/private spaces for affording social exchange and shared experiences (of memories, especially, but not exclusively, for our purposes). This aspect of the project will therefore be highlighted through the website and publicity, and our findings made available to libraries and related agencies for their own use in potentially supporting their case against cuts. 

The current threats to libraries increase the urgency of this bid. We need to carry out this project now as these could be the dying moments of library-based reading groups. In the Wandsworth district alone, there is at least one group that can no longer meet in the library due to closures. Such groups may go on meeting, but in each others' houses. The social spaces of social exchange are changing, if not disappearing, and the affects need to be understood. The internet provides new channels for readers and groups or communities to form (eg. electronic book clubs and blogs). By inviting contributions back into the project (as mentioned above and in Pathways to Impact), the project website may help to understand and even to mitigate the loss of libraries for some, by providing an alternative space as a hub of activity for social exchange and discussion.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-06-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>297531</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Wandsworth Heritage Service</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Libraries</gtr:description><gtr:id>1CC3BAB8-EACD-40F4-BAEC-BAE16B417650</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Interviews and reading group discussions.

We have also now organised public talks and discussions with Wandsworth librarians, drawing on the Memories of Fiction interviews, to contribute to the Wandsworth Heritage Festival (at Balham and Putney libraries) this coming May and June (2017). 

We are also offering our findings to Wandsworth and other library organisations, in part to enhance understandings of library users, and to increase interest and participation in reading groups.

She presented early findings from the Memories of Fiction group oral history interviews, in a talk entitled, 'Remembering Fiction and Making Identities: What can Book Groups Tell Us about Group and Individual Memory?'. The content of the talk was innovative. There is little research on conducting oral histories with groups. What does exist is confined mainly to sociology and linguistics and so does not draw on oral history theory and methodology. Several questions were posed at the end of the paper, and anecdotal evidence demonstrated that oral historians are keen to learn interviewing theory and method for working with groups.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bd7c547b8c69.59743992</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>2016 TECHNE AHRC Doctoral Training Partnership Annual Conference</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7BC23EC1-3C98-488B-ADFA-F7209748536A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I was invited to present on the Keynote Panel at the TECHNE AHRC Doctoral Training Partnership Annual Conference on 'Memory and Perception' drawing on the group interview work in the Memories of Fiction project.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c543e377f695.93408290</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://memoryandperception.com/documents/programme.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talk to Secondary School Pupils (Ibstock Place), 'The Importance of Reading for Pleasure</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F182FE9F-6F74-4DBE-A40C-C1457660768F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Amy Tooth Murphy was invited to be a guest speaker at an assembly of Senior 10 students at Ibstock Place School, where she spoke on the importance of reading for pleasure.

There is clear crossover with this community of academics with the work of the Memories of Fiction project. However, the MoF team are not Book Historians per se, and so we were keen to use the opportunity to network within this sub-field, and to gather responses to our research that could enhance our analysis going forward for publication. The paper was well received by the audience. Questions from the floor highlighted that the audience were not experts in oral history. This, therefore, enabled us to expose new audiences to our research.

Most participants were from the university but the series was publicised and open to all; others came from further afield (e.g. Bronwen Thomas from Bournemouth). Comments include that of 'doctor d' who writes that he will use Towheed's podcast in a class called Reading in/as Revolution. S/he writes, 'This is a welcome addition to my resources, and will enrich my students' learning experiences.'</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>586659ce757356.15114727</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://memoriesoffiction.org/2015/05/07/listen-now-podcast-by-dr-shafquat-towheed-evidence-from-the-uk-reading-experience-database/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015,2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Oral history interviews and reading group discussions</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>71BA2253-8192-42CA-9CE3-E94B130BCC40</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The project researchers first met up with six library based reading groups in the Wandsworth borough (5-15 members attended each session), to introduce the project and invite group members to take part. They then went on to carry out nearly 50 interviews with 25 group members (two interviews each). The primary purpose was to gather material for the archive including memories of reading experiences, but this process also engaged people from the outset and the interviews sparked questions and discussion and interest in the project. At the end of interviews, participants were asked how they found the process of being interviewed. Many testified to enjoying it, finding it interesting, gaining new insights about themselves and other benefits. Participants have reported satisfaction from finding that previously forgotten but formative reading experiences have come back to them, and from finding out more about themselves. For example, one participant described being interviewed as a 'revelation' as she hadn't realised that reading was so prominent and important in her life. She now newly conceives of herself as a 'reader'. The interviews will provide the main source for analysis in future publications deriving from, and hopefully beyond, the Memories of Fiction project. Following the individual interviews, Amy Tooth Murphy and Graham Smith have carried out five reading group discussions. Again participants have described finding these interesting and they have also facilitated new communications between the group members. As well as providing material for analysis, these discussions have continued to generate interest in the project on which we plan to build for the next stage of the project: public talks.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ac1ffccf6cb8.22065393</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.roehampton.ac.uk/research-centres/memories-of-fiction/archive/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014,2015,2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seminar: Australian Readers Remember</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>15306730-D1F9-4996-8A60-9B0D7076D877</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Martyn Lyons gave a talk entitled 'The Australian Readers Remember project in retrospect, or why we (still) need an oral history of reading', at the seminar series jointly run by the Oral History Society and the Institute of Historical Research. These talks are free and open to all. 15-20 people attended, including community and HE-based oral historians, academics and postgraduates. The talk stimulated lively discussion amongst all those who attended. The talk was also an opportunity to introduce the Memories of Fiction project, and many of the participants asked for more information about the project in the discussion and chats over drinks afterwards. A podcast of the talk is available.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>586649056bfe51.52576185</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://memoriesoffiction.org/2014/09/11/memories-of-fiction-out-and-about-a-busy-start-to-september/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>OHS Conference: 'Beyond Text in the Digital Age?

Oral History, Images, and the Written Word', and was organised by Amy Tooth Murphy, Shelley Trower, and Sarah Pyke among others from Roehampton and the Oral History Society. The project helped to inform the conference theme and thus had some input into the direction of the OHS, which in turn provided broad context for the Memories of Fiction project. A strand through the conference included panels on oral histories of reading. The Reading Sheffield project among others helped to affirm that written texts are by no means redundant in the digital age; written and spoken words continue to be intertwined in multiple ways. The conference will help to inform the project, in particular Trower's monograph currently entitled Oral History and the Written Word (proposal with OUP), and we have approached some of the speakers about possible inclusion in an edited collection or special issue (under discussion). Parts of the conference were open to the public and a podcast is available (see link below).

As always, this year's conference was attended by a wide range of delegates including community-based oral historians as well as academics. 140 delegates attended from many countries across Europe and beyond. Parts were also open to the general public. It generated multiple tweets and retweets, and a report (available below) which further helped to disseminate the conference.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5866ca3251efa2.98388531</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ohs.org.uk/beyond-text-in-the-digital-age-conference-report/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>It is still early stages but we can sketch out three ways in which this project is so far beginning to have an impact beyond the academic sphere:

1) Participants seem to benefit from and express satisfaction in taking part in the interviews and discussions (see oral history interviews in 'Engagement' section). This mode of impact will develop in the next stages of the project when we conduct the public discussions.

2) The project has provided some direction for oral historians especially in the UK, through the Oral History Society. The Society supports oral historians working on community projects as well as in academic spheres. As all three members of the project team are also Trustees of the Society, our work on the project has informed our involvement in the Society's activities and events in various ways as outlined in sections of this form, including through our participation in oral history seminar series, workshops and the forthcoming Advanced Oral History Spring School (May 2017). The conference theme also raised issues, questions and discussions about the form of oral history as spoken/written words. 

3) The project's findings are already of interest to diverse groups: as well as the academic interest in our project (among book historians, for example, at the conference and other events listed), is the interest expressed by librarians and in a broader public sphere. This interest can be illustrated so far by the invitation from the Chartered Institute for Librarians and Public Information Professionals to write a piece for their magazine; the invitation from Wandsworth Heritage Service to present alongside librarians at the Wandsworth Heritage Festival; the invitation from The Big Issue editor to write a piece (deadline 20 March 2017). 

We will be building on these and other forms of impact over the coming year. A main area of focus will be on supporting the case for libraries and potentially to contribute to policy. We have so far been in touch with various groups with this aim, including the Reading Agency and the Libraries All Party Parliamentary Group with whom we hope to build a relationship.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>7FA4BD01-19E3-4E42-ACCE-F320ED1221BD</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>58c70af0c7f749.69463634</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Project interviews and interview summaries are available online where interviewees gave permission.
