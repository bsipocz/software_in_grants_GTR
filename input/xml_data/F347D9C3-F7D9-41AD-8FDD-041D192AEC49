policy makers and other members of the public with the fascination of Chemistry and Materials Science. One of the most important
aspects of this is to stress the cutting-edge relevance of these sciences to the world ? expressing their excitement but also their
importance in finding solutions to many of the life-improving challenges faced by the world today. It is often easy for people to
dismiss Chemistry as ?solved?, whereas the truth is far different ? Chemistry, often in combination with Engineering, Biology,
Medicine, Physics and others, is exciting, dynamic and evolving. Metaphorically and literally, this is what our Molecular Odyssey will
seek to show. By using the non-conventional method of molecular movies, created through the use of STFC-funded facilities, as
well as beautiful imagery and physical models to encourage hands-on interaction, we aim to capture the imagination and ?convert
the unconverted?, as well as engaging those who already have an interest, by showing that Chemistry is more than ?just stinks and
bangs!?
We can show how molecules react, how structures assemble and how chemical and biological processes occur through the use of
these visualisation techniques. We will demonstrate both fast and slow processes involving units ranging in size from one molecule
to a macroscopic array of atoms or molecules. In all these processes we will illustrate the importance of synchrotron radiation, of
neutron diffraction and of laser spectroscopy in helping us to ?see? the processes as they occur ? without these facilities, now
available on the RAL site, it would not be possible to make the molecular movies that illustrate our fantastic science!
The impact of our project is to show all levels of society the beauty and fascination of the molecular world, which is every bit as
diverse and dynamic as stupractical terms we hope this will result in an increased transition of young people from GCSE to A-level Chemistry, onwards and
upwards into degree-level subjects such as Chemistry, Biochemistry and Materials Science, thereby strengthening the science base
of the UK.
Working through our STEM Ambassador, we are engaging with A-Level teachers to keep them up-to-date with current research
science, helping cascade our impact outwards to their students. The effectiveness of this engagement will be greatly enhanced
through the materials we will develop as part of The Molecular Odyssey project.
Our programme also involves graduate students and early-career researchers, so will give these young people the opportunity to
enhance their presentation and communication skills, again adding to the talent pool of the UK.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-04-26</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-27</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>3500</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/J50015X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
