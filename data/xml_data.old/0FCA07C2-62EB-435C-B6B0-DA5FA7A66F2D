In contrast, morality and religion teach us to be honest. Surprisingly little is known about how people actually behave in this dilemma of economic incentives and moral values. This lack of knowledge is partly due to the difficulty of identifying whether a specific individual lies.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project will investigate how people report their private information from a different angle: by analysing reporting patterns in a group of people. This is sufficient to answer many important questions, eg regarding which circumstances reduce lying, the impact of socio-economic variables, or the relationship of honesty with other moral values that people might hold.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The aim of the project is to develop an empirically validated theory which explains the current experimental data on reporting behaviour and delivers novel predictions on how institutions can encourage truth-telling. This project will combine economic theory with laboratory experiments and representative experiments, ie experiments using a representative sample of the population, outside the laboratory.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Although the main focus of this project is to further our understanding of preferences and thus to advance economic theory, the results of the project will also be interesting for many parties outside academia. 

Tax authorities and social security bodies are interested in how to identify people who misreport their income or eligibility and at the same time would like to reduce such misreporting. This research could inform both endeavours. Moreover, the representative experiment could indicate which groups of the population are most likely to evade taxes. The model might even point to effective alternatives to auditing, in the spirit of 'nudging'. The cabinet office has set up a 'Behavioural Insights Team' to use psychology and behavioural economics to inform interventions. In this spirit, HMRC is currently testing different ways to formulate letters to chase late tax payers and first results indicate that an extra &amp;pound;160m could be collected with appropriately formulated letters. There might exist similarly easy ways to reduce tax evasion. Results of this study, especially project 5, could also inform policies that try to induce truth-telling by naming and shaming.

Private firms could also be interested in my research. The current financial crisis was triggered by a housing boom in the USA, which in turn was fuelled by mortgages given to households whose income was too low to qualify for normal mortgages. Many of these sub-prime mortgages were issued as &amp;quot;low-documentation&amp;quot; mortgages, involving only unconfirmed claims about own income. Banks and mortgage-lenders have a strong interest in better understanding which kinds of person are more likely to overstate their income in such mortgage applications and how to design the applications to reduce such over-reporting. Similar problems arise for other types of debt, e.g., via credit cards. Furthermore, insurance companies have to decide which claims might be fraudulent; understanding how people report private informationis essential to do this. They also have to identify which groups of their clients are most likely to commit insurance fraud to adapt contracts (see project 3).

Within firm, efficient information transmission is crucial for the success of any business. Understanding why people misreport is a prerequisite to design environments that increase the reliability of this information transmission. The screening of job seekers is another potential application. More generally, every hidden-information principal-agent problem involves the reporting of private information; labour contracts can shape these settings to some extent. How such contracts should be designed when agents have a preference for truth-telling is so far not understood.

On average, people forgo 78% of the potential (monetary) gains from lying. At least for an economics audience, this is very surprising. The size and robustness of the effect suggest that policy interventions that rely on voluntary truth-telling by some participants could be very successful. They could be easier or cheaper to implement and they could achieve outcomes that are impossible to achieve if incentive compatibility is required. 

I have started the process of getting policy makers to think about how they could use these insights to improve the efficiency of public services. In particular, I have presented and discussed these results at the National Audit Office, the Competition and Market Authority and Oxera, an economic consultancy which, for example, works for the Financial Conduct Authority.

This project does not only target users in government but also aims to change the public perception of honesty and morality in general. Recently, the honesty of highly visible groups of people, including politicians, bankers and athletes, has been doubted. These doubts have led to widespread cynicism about western democracy and market economies in general. But how representative are these scandals for the level of honesty of &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; people? We provide the first reliable, quantitative evidence that normal people are quite honest and that the right regulatory environment could be able to get the above-named groups to show similar levels of honesty. I have already presented the results of the project to lay audiences and am working together with the ESRC and the University of Oxford on a press release to disseminate these results to a national and global audience.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>67050FED-6B53-42B6-BB03-EA571046604A</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56e052e4c7cf58.71507438</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The central objective of this research is to better understand how people report their private information. Many situations of everyday life involve one person having private information and telling another person or institution about it. Examples range from job interviews to tax declarations. For decades, economists have studied such situations from a theoretical viewpoint, always assuming that people say whatever lies in their immediate interest - which is mostly not the truth.
With Anke Becker and Armin Falk, I have provided the strongest evidence so far that this assumption is not correct. We call a representative sample of the German population on the phone at home and ask them to flip a coin and to tell us the outcome. If they report tails, we send them 15 euros. If they report heads, they get nothing. The economic rationale is clear: all participants should report tails regardless of their true coin flip. We find that about half of participants report tails (actually even slightly less). On average people tell the truth, exactly the opposite of the usual economic assumption. The paper has been published in the Journal of Public Economics.
In the next step, I collected data of more than 60 coin-flip experiments which are fast becoming popular across psychology, sociology and economics. With Daniele Nosenzo and Collin Raymond, I show that truth-telling is widespread and can consistently be found in all 30 countries surveyed. On average, people take only about a third of the money they can get by lying maximally. We then look at different explanations that have been suggested for this behaviour. Lying could be perceived as bad per-se and thus involve a &amp;quot;lying cost&amp;quot;. Or people might want to appear as honest and thus refrain from lying maximally. We formalize these ideas and test them in new experiments. We show that no single model can explain the observed behaviour. Lying is multi-faceted and driven by several motives at the same time. 
But where do such &amp;quot;preferences for truth-telling&amp;quot; come from? I address this question in two ways. First, I analyse other behaviours of honest people. In an experiment with Daniele Nosenzo, I find that subjects who are more likely to be honest tend to give more to charity, are more likely to return a favour (positive reciprocity) and to trust others. Honesty is not correlated with the likelihood to take revenge (negative reciprocity). This suggest that a common trait drives honesty, trust and altruism. 
Secondly, I investigate how the peer group during adolescence affects honesty and other economic preferences. Since friends are usually not allocated randomly, this is a tricky question to answer. I have started an ambitious project which is still on-going with Toke Fosgaard and Lars Hansen. Leveraging this ESRC grant, we have obtained an additional &amp;pound;150,000 grant from the Carlsberg Foundation. We make use of a natural experiment in which more than 5000 refugee children and their families were allocated randomly to towns in Denmark. We are contacting these (now grown-up) children to measure their preferences and can thus identify the impact of their randomly allocated peer group.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>I have widely disseminated the research related to this grant by presenting it more than 40 times - to academics in seminars and conferences, to potential users (e.g., the National Audit Office and the Competition and Markets Authority), and to the wider public (e.g., during the Live Friday events at the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford). As a consequence, our paper in the Journal of Public Economics has already been cited more than 50 times.
By clarifying which motives underpin truth-telling and lying, we have paved the way for new measures to reduce lying for the use by, e.g., tax authorities or insurance companies. We have shown that direct lying costs are important, as well as concerns about reputation and beliefs about what others do. Additionally, curtailing the possibility to lie for some has positive knock-on effects on the behaviour of others. Our research thus offers a toolbox of different mechanisms to reduce lying.
While we have identified several conditions that any model of lying behaviour has to fulfil, we are sure other researchers across the social sciences will find additional conditions. Our theoretical framework has laid the foundation for others to extend and to build a more complete model of how people report private information.
Finally, the large meta-study data set that we have collected is a unique resource for other researchers to test new hypotheses without the need to run new experiments, thus maximizing the impact of our research.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D4ED9EC1-73EC-49CE-BFA2-D4252A9F9EAE</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5682e9b6654a62.50798930</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Presentation to Oxera Consulting LLP</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A8D8E574-A1FC-47D1-B229-78C1D0BFFB77</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>57ee4e58c648a4.67144285</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Summer course for Chinese professors</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Asia</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>ADC2E06C-AE99-4A75-A9FF-581FCC3D4156</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5672a8a37ec186.74161406</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.oxcep.com/?q=seminar#section1</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Presentation to National Audit Office</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7ADDC9CE-48D5-4C63-9BDC-4458877D1A8F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5458c888047579.41567712</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Presentation to Competition and Market Authorities</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>36D15B03-E08C-4191-A57D-2E40075B01C3</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5672a50128cd03.52088160</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4375EA7A-CCA2-49AF-B2AF-FA7397CE6772</gtr:id><gtr:title>Representative evidence on lying costs</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Public Economics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d40982c17e40db9cc106d2d6a85ca9b6"><gtr:id>d40982c17e40db9cc106d2d6a85ca9b6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Abeler J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>542dc40f7b20d4.81919188</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>376AC041-0EF0-476A-853B-537E72CEA164</gtr:id><gtr:title>Preferences for Truth-Telling</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/cabdb99c40ec45501d4a04beace4ef9a"><gtr:id>cabdb99c40ec45501d4a04beace4ef9a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>J Abeler</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>57ee4d27182ab1.99766693</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/K001558/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
