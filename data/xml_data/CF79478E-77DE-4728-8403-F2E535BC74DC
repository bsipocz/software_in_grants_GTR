Thousands of others were transported to Bermuda and Gibraltar as an interim destination, before also being sent on at a later stage of their sentences to the Australian colonies. Despite Charles Bateson's recognition in his book The Convict Ships (1959) that the 'history of the conveyance of those prisoners is absorbingly interesting, full of the rich drama of human suffering and human endeavour', strikingly little scholarly attention has been paid either to the organisation of the ships prior to departure or to convict and other experiences of the voyages themselves. Indeed, half a century after it was first published, Bateson's work remains the sole scholarly monograph on the subject. This gap stands in sharp contrast not only with the increasingly substantial literature on the experiences of transported convicts after their disembarkation in the colonies but also with the rapidly developing secondary literatures on the voyages of other contemporaneous groups including free emigrants, indentured servants and slaves and with the now burgeoning interest in histories of the sea. This research project seeks to fill this gap: its aim is to write an experiential history of the convict ship. Convict ships were designed and experienced as sites of coercion and constraint. Yet they were also sites of mobility and of the crossing and expansion of boundaries: geographical, physical, mental, emotional, cultural, social and more. Convicts were prisoners, but they were also travellers. They were constrained and confined, but in ways that made them move. This project explores three central aspects of those movements: the multiple spaces and places through which convicts travelled; the attempts to render convicts into the ocean-going subjects of ship-board regimes designed to effect their mental and corporeal transformations; and the subjective, emotional and relational journeys that convicts, their families and friendship networks had necessarily to make.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The main beneficiaries of the research beyond the academic community will include: the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich; genealogists and family historians; and members of the public, particularly in Britain and Australia, with interests in the histories of empire, the sea, migration and convict transportation to the colonies. \n\nThe project has been partly developed in collaboration with the National Maritime Museum at Greenwich. Some materials will be made available via the National Maritime Museum's website, and through its blog and podcasting facilities and will hopefully also feed into their new major gallery on voyagers, planned for 2012. A space for small, temporary exhibitions will also be made available at the NMM from 2012 as a result of their gallery reorganisation and I will be submitting a proposal to use this space. I will work closely with the National Maritime Museum to develop these outputs. Public lectures will be given at other venues including the Victoria &amp;amp; Albert Museum. The project is linked to a blog (http://convictvoyaging.blogspot.com/) and will also include a website. The website will make transcripts of a range of the key archival deployed in the book publicly available for groups including: interested readers of the book; educationalists; genealogists and family historians. By engaging with histories of coerced migration from Britain and Ireland to other parts of the world, the project seeks to deliver an important historical context to ongoing current public debates and sentiments about coerced and other forms of migration from other countries and regions to the British Isles. It also asks its audiences to consider the many emotional, personal, social and cultural challenges, as well as the numerous opportunities, which migration brings. The project therefore brings an historical dimension to bear upon our understandings of the multiple challenges as well as benefits of living in our global, transnational and increasingly mobile world. \n\nI have a well-established public engagement record in public engagement, having worked closely with a range of Australian based institutions and projects over a number of years, with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and also the BBC. As the Department of Historical Studies' Public Engagement coordinator, I have a close working relationship with the University of Bristol's Centre for Public Engagement and I will draw on this relationship to help inform and shape and also ensure delivery of the impact outputs of this project. \n\n\n\n\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>44206</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I003282/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DCE73056-5E3D-4976-B573-234E5FF4D633</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic &amp; Social History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
