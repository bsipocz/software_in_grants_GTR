Using virtual worlds and on-line social networking technologies as historical research tools.</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/I025735/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This project involves the reconstruction of the experiences of a Norwegian peasant, the fictitious (but historically informed) Ola Nordmann, leaving his home near Voss in Western Norway in the 1880s and setting off on the long journey to a new life in the Midwest of the United States. We will be using the extensive historical materials available in the British Library in London and in Norwegian archives to create a virtual world in which he leaves his home, travels to the port of Bergen and from there to Liverpool via Hull and a train journey across England. He then travels by steamship to New York, where our story ends. The purpose of the project is to investigate whether a virtual world can recreate a historical experience more effectively for a non-academic audience than traditional written versions of history and whether it can inspire informants to engage with historical research and provide personal and local information to inform that historical account. From our privileged positions the experience of leaving the safety (and also the hardships) of rural Norway and making such a momentous journey is hard for us to imagine or to get close to, and it doesn't come across very forcefully via the received documentation of that experience. This project animates history through the character of Ola Nordmann, with whom the public can interact and on whose experiences they can comment as he travels. The comments of contributors will be used to enhance and develop this virtual world over during the 8-month central phase of the project. We also seek in particular to generate more information about the England stage of the journey, which has been less intensively studied, initially by means of our contacts at the seamen's churches in Hull and Liverpool and subsequently through the Ola Nordmann project. This England stage will be a particular focus in the virtual world. \n\nWe hope that the project will be informative and entertaining for a large community of potential beneficiaries. Between the 1820s and the 1920s more than 800,000 Norwegians left for the promised land, which means that there are millions of American citizens today of Norwegian descent. Second Life, one of the most widely known examples of a virtual world, has 18 million registered users, and so we are hoping to engage with a lot of individuals with an interest in both the project's content and its design. The project also aims to make a serious contribution to historical research methodology by trialling the use of on-line social networks as a tool for carrying out oral history and for engaging with informants. The project design also allows the team to investigate the relationship between historical record and collective memory and to evaluate how the actual historical experiences of the migrants have been distorted and redefined as the memory of them has been passed down through the generations.\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who might benefit from this research?\n\nThe principal beneficiaries are likely to be members of the public with a vested interest in the subject matter, either because of family connections or a connection with the places visited in the virtual world. It is expected that the social network will generate new and/or previously unavailable insights into the migration process which could enhance the self-knowledge of millions of Norwegian and US citizens with a background touched by its drama.\n\nSecond Life has 18 million registered users, indicating a substantial community of computer users whose quality of life is enhanced by interaction with virtual worlds. We expect that they will benefit from this project by being able to engage with history in a virtual context and at the same time learn about something they may previously not have known about.\n\nThis project represents a new application for virtual world technology of potential use to commercial companies creating and using virtual worlds for other purposes. The HRI has established partnerships with serious games companies, and it is expected that the serious games industry in particular will benefit from the experience of the Ola Nordmann Goes West project.\n\nThe speculative nature of this proposal means that formal engagement with policy-makers will only be appropriate as results are gathered and evaluated at the end of the project. However, large-scale migration is one of the most pressing political challenges of our own day, and politicians at various levels could benefit from increased understanding of the long-term impacts of it, and the PI and HRI will actively pursue this beyond the project period. \n\nHow might they benefit from this research?\n\nThose with a vested interest in the subject matter will learn more about their own history, not only from potentially new information and material becoming available but by the opportunity to engage socially with others with similar cultural references. We anticipate that like-minded people will 'meet' through Ola Nordmann and be enriched by that experience. It is also expected that the body of knowledge about Norwegian emigration will be nuanced and personalised by the humanisation of the data (Ola Nordmann will himself be a (virtual) person and real people will interact around him). It may be that those who have been unable to engage with their family history via traditional documentary means will find a way into it via a possibly more familiar interface (computer worlds and on-line networking).\n\nThe virtual world and serious games industry may benefit from our experiences by gaining a better understanding of the reliability and usefulness of user-posted content.\n\nWhile the virtual world will close to new contributions from the public after month fourteen in order to allow the project team to evaluate it and present findings at conferences and in journals, the collected information and materials will remain accessible via the internet for at least seven more years and will provide valuable materials for museums and galleries, particularly in Scandinavia and the American Mid-West (where the majority of Scandinavian migrants settled). There are several established museums of Norwegian emigration (e.g. The Norwegian Emigrant Museum near Hamar, Norway and the Vesterheim Norwegian-American Museum in Decorah, Iowa).\n\nExperience on the project will provide the RA with new research skills. To quote the HRI's Digital Worlds mission statement, 'arts and humanities research brings a unique perspective on the problems which face the knowledge economy thanks to the methodologies which are inherent within its subjects'.

We discovered that there is an appetite for this way of allowing users to engage with historical events and we also found that historical associations as well as individuals in Norway, the UK and the USA responded enthusiastically to the possibility of being able to share in this history. We discovered various practical challenges which will need to be overcome if this sort of technology is going to be a really valuable addition to the historian's toolkit. Traditional virtual world software is clunky and makes considerable demands on its users, especially during the early stages. We suggest that more recent WebCT technology, which allows access to the virtual world direct from a web browser and without having to download and install software may be the way forward.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Any other projects which seek to reanimate history, especially where a journey or other movement in space is a key feature, could well explore this technology further.
