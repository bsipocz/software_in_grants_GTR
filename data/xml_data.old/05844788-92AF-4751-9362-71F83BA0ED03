We have previously demonstrated that in rats with a complete spinal cord transection epidural electrical stimulation of segments below the level of lesion can induce stepping. In combination with daily rehabilitation stepping ability can be re-trained to become indistinguishable from non-injured animals. We have also recently observed that rehabilitation leads to increased amounts of molecules (chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans) known to be inhibitory to axonal growth and synaptic plasticity. Here, we propose to investigate whether removal of such inhibitory molecules by an enzyme (chondroitinase ABC) will enhance the positive effects of epidural stimulation and rehabilitation on functional recovery. We will use a clinically relevant model of spinal cord injury, drug delivery times and rehabilitation interventions to determine the efficacy of such combination. Recently, epidural stimulation has been demonstrated to be effective in the recovery of standing ability and voluntary movement control in a human patient with a severe cervical injury. In addition, development of chondroitinase ABC is in final pre-clinical development. The combination of these interventions could result in significant functional gains for patients with severe spinal cord injuries.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>We have previously demonstrated that in rats with a complete thoracic spinal cord transection epidural electrical stimulation (ES) of the lumbar spinal cord can restore locomotor function, especially when combined with daily locomotor training. This approach has been successfully applied to a human patient with a severe incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI), who regained independent standing ability and voluntary control of lower limb muscles while under ES. However, this patient did not recover independent walking. Other factors may prevent further functional recovery. Our preliminary observations strongly suggest that rehabilitation upregulates expression of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans in the lumbar spinal cord, especially in perineuronal nets around motoneurones, thereby inhibiting synaptic plasticity and making rehabilitation less effective. It has been shown that treatment with chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) opens a window during which rehabilitation could be dramatically more effective by removing perineuronal nets. We propose to test whether digestion of perineuronal nets by ChABC can enhance the effects of ES and locomotor training in a severe contusion model of SCI. ChABC will be administered via a lentival vector delivered at the time of lesion or 28 days post-lesion. Trained rats will be supported in a quadrupedal position and step for 30 min daily under ES. Motor and sensory behavioural tests will determine the extent of functional recovery. A combination of anatomical, physiological and histological analyses will determine underlying mechanisms. ES is already available to patients, while ChABC is in late preclinical development. Finding out the parameters for combining rehabilitation, ES and ChABC is therefore a precursor to a potentially dramatically successful treatment for human patients.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The immediate beneficiaries of these studies will be people who have suffered a traumatic injury to the spinal cord and potentially any other severe neurological condition which results in loss of motor function in the limbs, such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, etc. The major aim of the proposed interventions is the recovery of sensorimotor function, which ultimately is the final interest of patients and caregivers. Allowing severely disabled people to regain voluntary control of movement can have enormous impact in their health and life in general. Even apparently minor gains in movement can have significant impact in, for example, their ability to transfer and exercise, reducing secondary problems such as bed ulcers, hypotension, etc., and improving quality of life.
Our proposed animal experiments may benefit people with spinal cord injury (SCI) relatively quickly given the fact that epidural stimulation is routinely used in the clinic, for example, for the treatment of chronic pain. Indeed, the results of my own animal experiments (1-3) have lead to the successful application of epidural stimulation in a human patient. A recent experiment has demonstrated the feasibility of applying epidural stimulation to induce motor recovery in a person with severe SCI (4). This patient not only recovered some voluntary movement control over leg muscles, but also regained control over bowel and bladder, and sexual functions. These encouraging results urgently warrant further development and refinement of such intervention. 
The results of the proposed experiments will further inform human interventions about how best to maximize the beneficial effects of applying epidural stimulation for functional recovery. In addition to sharing results in scientific meetings and conferences, we propose an active exchange of information with groups currently applying such techniques in humans, specifically with the Kentucky Spinal Cord Injuries Research Center at the University of Louisville, KY. At the moment, there are no groups in the UK actively applying epidural stimulation for the recovery of motor function in SCI patients. However, we have on-going collaborative work with the Yorkshire Spinal Cord Injuries Centre at Pinderfields Hospital in Wakefield. Implementation and transfer of knowledge with the medical staff (Mr. Wajid Raza and Mr. Firas Jamil, Spinal Cord Injuries consultants) is currently very active and the possibility of initiating human experiments involving epidural stimulation in the UK is also imminent. 
The costs associated with long-term care of people with spinal cord injuries are significant with more severe cases requiring even more funding. Our interventions could result in significant improvement in independence and quality of life for people with SCI, and consequently significantly decreasing the financial burden on UK health systems.
