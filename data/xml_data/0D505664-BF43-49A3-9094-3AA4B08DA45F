In response to an acute infection, the body enhances or reduces the production of a range of proteins. Since all proteins are encoded for by genes, this process is regulated by up or downregulation of the corresponding genes.||To approach the question why some individuals develop severe malaria whereas others dont we collect blood samples from cases with severe forms of malaria and cases with uncomplicated malaria, and compare which genes are up or downregulated. This is done using the so-called microarray technique which allows determining the transcription profile of the whole genome. To identify in which lymphocyte subsets a particular set of genes is differentially up or downregulated, major lymphocyte populations are isolated from whole blood prior for their transcription profile to be tested by microarray technique.||From the results of this study we hope to derive new information of which processes may determine the difference between severe and uncomplicated malaria. This may reveal new targets for therapeutic interventions or vaccines.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Analysis of differential gene expression between mild and severe malaria provides insight into what genes influence the development of complicated disease, a poorly understood process. Microarray technology combined with sophisticated computational analysis tools and confirmatory molecular biology experiments are a powerful method of identifying pathways that determine poor outcome in disease and can thus be targeted for therapy. Preliminary work using microarray analysis in animal models of malaria has identified pathways putatively involved in the development of anemia or cerebral malaria.||Studies of Plasmodium falciparum infection in people have only begun to examine gene expression of parasites, or of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and have not comprehensively examined differential gene expression between severe and mild malaria.||Using samples collected from our well-established platform recruiting children with severe and uncomplicated malaria, the aim of this study is to investigate global transcriptional differences between cases of severe and mild malaria, and to compare gene expression of major leukocyte subpopulations between these groups (CD4+, CD8+, CD14+) that will be isolated using magnetic bead-labelled antibodies. Genome-wide expression microarray analysis will be performed.||The goals of this study are two-fold to identify what genes and pathways are involved in the development of severe malaria and also what leukocyte populations may be responsible for the pathophysiological changes seen in severe disease.||We are currently in the process of optimizing depletion strategies for cell subsets and are exploring ways to improve the yield of high quality mRNA from these cell subsets. It is planned to recruit up to 10 samples of severe disease and 10 samples of uncomplicated disease for this study during the next malaria transmission season.||The arrays will be performed in collaboration with Prof Paul Kayes lab and Dr Naveed Aziz at the University of York.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-04-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>476878</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MC_U190092705</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>03BA7BC9-C251-48FC-8EA9-5F7414A63FEE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Infection</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
