The focus of the proposed research project is extending the use of laser printed transfer systems by exploring the use of new materials, methods and economies within a commercial context. The research will help revitalize the UK ceramics industry and so support regeneration across the UK in locations where ceramics manufacturing is situated.
The UK ceramics industry is suffering from a major recession and faces ongoing competition from East Asia. Digital laser printed ceramic decoration offers a new set of possibilities for revitalizing the UK ceramics industry. Alongside the opportunities for developing new aesthetic and design approaches, the technology holds the potential for increased speeds, scales and economies of production. 
Directly printed digital inkjet technology is now used in the decoration of some flat ceramic tiles. In contrast, ceramic objects such as tableware, figurines and other ornament forms with complex surfaces are still decorated by the older and indirect system known as ceramic transfer printing. Whilst it is possible to use laser printing to produce ceramic transfers, this has remained a marginal technology in the UK, used only for single print or small batch production jobs; the current market model is a bureau-based service. Due to the limited resources and current client base of the bureaux, there has been a lack of investment in developing the process for large-scale manufacturing. 
The proposed project aims to resolve this issue by building a consortium of innovators to explore the potential of this technology in large-scale manufacturing. Staff in the Ceramics and Glass programme at the Royal College of Art have arranged a collaboration with the inventor and patent holder of the laser printed ceramic transfer process, Michael Zimmer of MZTT, and the high-value ceramic manufacturers, Royal Crown Derby.
Professor Martin Smith of the RCA, an expert in combining ceramics and print, will be Principal Investigator for the project. Dr Steve Brown, whose PhD (funded by the AHRC) was focused on potential applications of digital print to complex ceramic objects, will be the primary researcher on the technical side. Dr Peter Oakley, who has previously conducted ethnographic research on the introduction of digital technologies in manufacturing industries, will be the Co-Investigator, undertaking the ethnographic fieldwork and an analysis of the social implications of adopting this technology. The project will be delivered over a period of 24 months, with the RCA researchers working closely with the technical staff in both industrial partners as well as with Royal Crown Derby's marketing staff and network of collectors.
A strong industry-facing dissemination programme, including workshops, exhibitions and a symposium, will showcase the project's technical findings. The intention is to reach industry leaders, creative designers and technical staff with a direct or tangential interest in digital printing applied to ceramics. In addition, a series of academic and public events and outreach activities, coordinated with RCA partners, will provide opportunities to inform academics, educators, graduate students, school pupils and other individuals interested in digital innovation. The planned publications will provide a long-lasting record which will be of use to policymakers whose remit covers the commercialization of digital technologies as well as to academics working on the take-up of new technologies and digital printing.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The main immediate impact beneficiaries will be companies working in the UK's ceramics industry, through the dissemination of the findings and opportunities to view and handle the material evidence produced during the course of the project. Specific dissemination events are being held in order to reach managerial and key technical staff working in these companies. The technical information will also support further innovations incorporating laser printed transfer systems into other commercial contexts, partially through a demonstration of its feasibility, but also in terms of identifying the strategies that need to be deployed in order to overcome barriers to adoption.

The project intends to test the viability of using a digital technology within an industry established in the UK but under strong external pressures. Either outcome - confirmation of its immediate potential or identification of barriers to adoption - will assist strategic development in this sector.
The ethnographic material gathered regarding the manufacturers' and consumers' perspectives on the technology and the products created will support policy development, helping policy-makers working on the adoption of new (and especially digital) technologies, the commercialisation of emerging technologies and the regeneration of the UK's manufacturing base. It will also inform those working on regional regeneration projects where manufacturing or the creative industries are considered part of the regeneration strategy. The project will, therefore, indirectly support not only commercial ceramic manufacturing and the workforce that relies on it for employment, but other related fields of manufacture.

The project will, as part of its structure, be piloting a research methodology that integrates technical innovation with consumer responses towards the products created. It will therefore provide a framework for other similar scaling-up or commercialisation of emerging technology projects that focus on other technological processes. The record of this framework will be captured in a project summary paper and explained in more detail in the written ethnographic outputs; the merits and potential pitfalls of this approach will therefore be available for industrial partners to refer to in future.

The exhibitions and outreach activities presenting the project's technical findings will assist universities, schools and museums to improve their offer by informing key staff: lecturers, curators, teachers and outreach workers of the potential of digital technologies in relation to ceramic manufacturing.
The open graduate student presentation will enable any attending graduate students studying in any institution to gain technical insights into the process and its possible commercial applications.

The schools outreach activities will inform young participants about the opportunities digital manufacturing can offer creative practitioners; it will also demonstrate the extent to which technology and creativity are intertwined in manufacturing practice and so enthuse potential designers and technologists about following either as a career path.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>267150</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A one person exhibition at Marsden Woo Gallery, London, UK that included three major works that made use of some of the early findings of the project</gtr:description><gtr:id>915AFDED-219B-4D1E-8061-7AAD2E62F63F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Marsden Woo is a major gallery specialising in the exhibition and promotion of the Applied Arts in an international context.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bfef4982be65.21356085</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Red and Black with Blue and Yellow</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://researchonline.rca.ac.uk/2738/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>In celebration of MK50; Milton Keynes 50th Birthday, the Arts Centre has invited 50 artists and designers to contribute to the 2017 Plate Fundraiser, an exhibition of the works and a live online auction from Friday 17 March 2017.

The project achieved this by developing new methods and approaches for using the laser printers and demonstrating these by creating tableware collection prototypes that have reached the intended specialist audience. By exploiting previously unregarded capabilities of the printers, the team has also extended the visual language of the process.

The PI and researcher worked to briefs developed through negotiation with the design teams and senior management from the project's industrial partners: Royal Crown Derby and Steelite Ltd, both major UK ceramic manufacturers. Through the results of this direct industrial engagement approach, these partners have become convinced digital laser printing is a viable production method. Having been introduced to DCS, the UK suppliers of the laser printing technology, Royal Crown Derby are now working with them on the development of underglaze printing and are currently negotiating the procurement of equipment.

By observing the industrial partners' perceptions of the technology of digital printing and their reactions to the results of the technology at different stages in the project, the Co-I was able to capture the positive change in attitudes towards digital laser printing over the two years of the project and identify the major sticking points regarding adoption. As well as being disseminated through academic channels, these findings have had an impact on policymaking through the Co-I's advisory activities with government organisations. 

In addition to being shown at planning events within the industrial partners, the collection of prototypes has also been exhibited at public and industry facing events. These include the British Ceramic Biennial in Stoke-on-Trent and Spring Fair at the Birmingham NEC. Through these events and studio tours at the RCA, the researchers have displayed and discussed the findings with designers working within the ceramic industry at other major UK companies.

The exhibition at Spring Fair also provided the opportunity to show the work to the retail sector, who were equally convinced by the results. Due to requests to purchase the prototype collections or commission special items or collections the PI and researcher are in the process of forming a spin out company to meet this demand.

The project has also engaged with the third sector through its relationship with Milton Keynes Arts Centre, a registered charity. The project supported the Arts Centre's major fundraising artist edition plate sales, working with Turner nominees and other established artists. As well as providing a further public platform to showcase the capabilities of the technology, this activity provided an opportunity to engage with an organisation that had previously commissioned printed ceramics from bureaux but had been dissatisfied with the quality of results. The commissions enabled the team to demonstrate how the new process could lead to more collaborative opportunities between artists and ceramic manufacturers that were fully exploiting the aesthetic capacities of digital print technology.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2017</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>BAED6504-4331-4FD7-8AE8-8E0231B576BB</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d9998f5221d0.70845305</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project has proved that digital laser printing has the potential to become a viable surface decorating technology for large-scale commercial ceramic manufacturing. It has demonstrated new aesthetic possibilities as well as confirming the anticipated functional and economic benefits and identifying the current engineering limitations that need to be addressed.

One of the research project's main achievements was to overcome the limitations of the technology's application of colour through innovations in multi-pass printing. By depositing toner over more than one registered pass through the printer, a wider palette of more saturated colour is now achievable through relatively simple and accessible methods. This has extended the technology's potential throughout the whole colour range without having to develop new toner colours in the laboratory. 

The project has also developed a new digitally-based visual language. Whilst digitally printed ceramics have been available through the bureaux model for some 15 years, the aesthetic was based on pre-digital imagery, so the potential of the new visual language has remained largely unexploited. The research has developed a new visual language previously unexploited by the ceramic tableware decoration industry.

Through observations of, and interviews with, staff working in the project partners, the individual participant's relationships with, or reactions to, the new technology were captured. These findings were used to identify specific barriers to the technology's adoption and the most important drivers behind change.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The project findings will be taken forward by the project team for the AHRC Follow on Funding Award: Improved Laser Printing Equipment for Ceramics (ILPEC) AH/P012965/1, which will bring further industry experts into round table discussions focussed on the further use of digital printing technology in the ceramics industry. These include, amongst others - software engineers - printer manufacturers - toner manufacturers - transfer paper manufacturers

The project findings will directly inform a spin off business that members of the research team are in the process of setting up. The spin off will continue to collaborate with key members of the commercial ceramic manufacturing and retail sectors, providing consultation and support, alongside providing a design and production service.

The project findings may also be put to use by any commercial ceramic manufacturers. Due to their engagement as industrial partners in the project: Royal Crown Derby and Steelite International have an advantage in respect to adopting the digital laser printing technology in question.

The ethnographic findings and the associated methodology will be relevant to future studies on the adoption of new digital technologies into manufacturing contexts and will inform policymakers involved with supporting innovation in the manufacturing sector.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>73856A79-966A-40C5-A3DA-8B13DB360DD3</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d999a0aa8455.89217354</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Crafts Council Report: Contributions of Craft to Innovation</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8F63DEF3-EE66-4B11-8D76-9288E7550CCF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The report prompted invitations to present findings to the technology event hosted by the All Parliamentary Group for Design and Innovation, and to brief DCMS officials on the craft economy.
