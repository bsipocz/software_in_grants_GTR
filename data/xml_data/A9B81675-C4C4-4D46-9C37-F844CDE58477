maternal traits and cow efficiency as one of 10 key areas for investment. The project outcomes will impact BLCS in the
following ways
- Increased market share will result in increased demand for Limousin cattle. This will directly impact the society as it will
result in increased registrations as the breeders produce more cattle to meet demand.
- BLCS will also share with SRUC profits from the sale of genotypes and GEBVs to the industry. Estimates of initial turn
over from the sale of fertility and survival GEBVs has been estimated to be &amp;pound;162,000 annually.
- The success of implementing female fertility and calf survival GEBVs will empower the society to address the other key
areas identified in the breeding strategy.
- Increased membership to the society will result from BLCS activities promoting the breed and increasing Limousin

popularity.
Limousin pedigree breeders - As a result of BLCS involvement, Limousin breeders will be impacted positively as result of
this project.
- Breeders will see the greatest benefit from increased market share of the Limousin breed. If popularity increases then
individual breeders will see a greater demand for pedigree bulls. 2014 saw an increase in the number of Limousin bulls
sold, and this increased sales by just under &amp;pound;1 million to a total of &amp;pound;6.5 million in 2014. This is increased revenue that goes
directly to Limousin pedigree breeders.
- The genetic improvement that can be achieved for female fertility and calf survival will also yield significant benefits to the
pedigree Limousin breeders as their cows will calve earlier, have shorter calving intervals and remain productive in the herd
for longer. All te attributes will have a direct financial benefit to breeders.
- The knowledge exchange programme as part of the project will enable breeders to learn more about genomics and the
new breeding tools for improving the fertility and survival of their herds.
Commercial producers - Those commercial producers who use Limousin genetics will also benefit from genetic
improvement for female fertility and calf survival. Like in the pedigree herd, commercial producers will benefit from cows
that calve earlier, have shorter calving intervals and remain productive in the herd for longer. If each Limousin sired cow
produced just 1 more progeny in her life this would result in an extra 496,000 calves available to the industry, or assuming
a 300kg carcass and 84% weaning rate an extra 125,000 tonnes of beef. This level of production is equivalent to 15% of
current production levels. This extra production will directly increase revenue for commercial producers.
Whole industry benefit - The increased production will impact who industry from the abattoirs being better able to source
beef through to the breeders who are able to sell more pedigree bulls. It is expected that improved fertility and survival will
generate profit primarily for producers engaged in beef production, and based on Limousin market penetration (31%) this is
expected to be worth &amp;pound;13.6M over 20 years to the wider beef industry. This increased revenue to the beef sector will also
benefit and impact the rural community as a whole with increased rural employment and wider rural enterprises. Not only
will production of beef increase but improving fertility and survival will reduce greenhouse gas emissions between 537,000
and 578,000 tonnes of CO2e over 20 years. The increased sustainability of the beef industry will have positive impacts on
a national scale.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>82835</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Findings from preliminary data analysis were published in the British Limousin Cattle Society's newsletter, informing industry of the distribution of age at first calf, calving interval, lifespan and calf survival. The raw data and preliminary genomic estimated breeding value (GEBV) results were also presented at Ulster Farmers Union Conference 2016. This information can be used by farmers to identify their position in comparison to other enterprises and improve their economic performance through the production of more fertile cattle and improved animal management. 

To ensure uptake of the new selection tools a number of short videos have been created and published on social media as part of the project. These video clips explain how GEBVs are calculated and how to use them.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>C6F55308-7923-4BA0-8333-1D503EFE52AF</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>589dbb4380c147.75904613</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>An improved set of estimated breeding values (EBVs) for fertility traits have been created from national data and are ready to be published for Limousin cattle in the UK. A new trait, calf survival, has also been created and EBVs are also ready to be published for Limousin cattle in the UK. 

A SNP key for fertility traits has been produced for the production of genimic estimated breeding values (GEBVs). The inclusion of genomics to the breeding values has improved the accuracy and can provide an accurate breeding value from birth which is important for late in life traits such as fertility.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The genomic estimated breeding values can be used by farmers of Limousin cattle in the UK to breed for fertile cows and healthy calves to improve the efficiency and productivity of their enterprise.
