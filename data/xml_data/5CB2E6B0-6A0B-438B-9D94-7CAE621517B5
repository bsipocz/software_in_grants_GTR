&lt;p>Dr Smith?s PhD considered this disjuncture in the field of health inequalities (in Scotland and England) and this post-doctoral project will further explore the connections between research, policy and practice within public health. It will extend the analysis of interviews and policy statements undertaken in Smith?s PhD to pursue the notion that the relationship between research and policy involves the interplay of ideas, rather than the utilisation of research evidence in policy.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This is a simple but important distinction for two reasons. First, as ideas are far more malleable than evidence, their influence on policy depends on a range of factors beyond the quality of the evidence. Second, this approach draws attention to the various ways in which policy influences research (as well as the other way round) and to the central, but often unintended, role of funders within this relationship. In developing this work, Smith will cultivate her typology of ideas (chameleonic, charismatic and institutionalised) to provide a theoretical framework that aims to change the way we think about the complex relationship between research, policy and practice.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>153765</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The politics of ideas : the complex relationship between research and policy in public health</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:id>520F8BFE-6C8F-4A01-8F94-76ABC5385B50</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited seminar</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-2808753329.151082ab7b94c</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The politics of ideas : the complex relationship between research and policy in public health</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:id>C48F7847-0BDB-46DB-8745-B03C4A2E7BDC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited lecture</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-4462845143.3618042ab2b33e</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Money matters : how 'cycles of credit' and resources shape the relationship between research and policy</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:id>40A0ACDF-5D1F-4901-BBD1-06750161BC30</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited seminar</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-5653920774.9570922aad8d82</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Transforming ideas : the complex interplay of health inequalities research and policy in the UK</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:id>80DFA248-33F8-47D6-BF05-E6ABDC510038</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited seminar</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-4451984040.8600722a901810</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The politics of ideas : why it's ideas, not evidence, that influence policy</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:id>9CBEE506-2AA5-4323-8030-49512947BA17</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited seminar</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-1300514425.43092582aecab02</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>One part of this research, a survey to explore health inequalities researchers' perspectives on potential policy proposals to reduce health inequalities in the UK, has informed an NHS Health Scotland report for the Scottish Government, a briefing by the Centre for Health and the Public Interest (a think tank) and an ASH Scotland policy briefing.

This ideational typology (informed by the theories of Max Weber and Bruno Latour) has broader public health relevance including for tobacco control, where the contrasting idea types help explain: (i) the long time-lag between the emergence of evidence about the harms caused by smoking and significant UK policy action to reduce those harms; and (ii) the flurry of policy activity in this area since 1997. There were three significant differences between the interviews undertaken for the PhD (in 2003-2006) and those undertaken during the Post-Doctoral Fellowship (2011-2012): (i) an increase in the levels of pessimism amongst policymakers and researchers about the prospects for reducing health inequalities in the UK (although there was rather more optimism in Scotland compared to the rest of the UK); (ii) a growing number of references to knowledge brokers, knowledge exchange and the research impact agenda (which were largely favourable); and (iii) an increase in the number of health inequalities researchers who identified themselves as public health advocates. The somewhat more optimistic perspective on health inequalities of interviewees based in Scotland appeared to be linked to a belied that policymakers in Scotland were more committed to state intervention to reduce health inequalities and to an equitable society. This requires further exploration in the context of current debates concerning Scottish independence. Whilst knowledge brokers were positively referred to by policymakers, all of the public health knowledge translation organisations identified in the research are small-scale and dependent on short-term funding. The data suggest these organisations are aiding public health knowledge translation to the extent that they are supporting inter-personal relationships and can serve as an accessible point of research contact for people in the policy world. However, the research suggested these organisations were hampered by their uncertain future, limited resources and confusion and uncertainty within the public health community about the best approaches to promoting knowledge translation. There were no examples of structural changes to the relationship between public health research and policy emanating from these organisations. Further research might usefully explore: (i) the longer-term trajectories and impacts of organisations with a remit for public health knowledge translation; and (ii) the impacts of the 'research impact' agenda (e.g. by analysing the REF impact case studies, due to be published in 2014). In the PhD interviews (2003-2006), it was notable that researchers involved in tobacco control were far more comfortable with their relationships to the advocacy and third sector community than health inequalities researchers (who struggled to name any relevant advocacy or third sector organisations). In contrast, in the more recent, Post-Doctoral interviews (2011-2012), most health inequalities researchers identified themselves as public health advocates and reflected that this was a recent change. Most researchers and policymakers also identified at least some relevant advocacy organisations, notably The Equality Trust. This suggests there has been a change in how health inequalities researchers view their role and that further research could usefully examine how different actors perceive public health advocacy and its relationship to academic work and to public health knowledge translation.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings suggest researchers working in public health need to do more to engage with the democratic and political aspects of policymaking in the UK. This could involve public health researchers building stronger relationships with third sector and community organisations, politicians and political movements and journalists and making greater use of social media opportunities. Research exploring these different relationships is also required.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>7201BA53-3E05-42B1-BE1E-ED62483C1A3E</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-9710011863.810953b2f2b68a</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8A67ABEA-2CE7-49FB-BF06-267CB58C109D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Institutional filters: the translation and re-circulation of ideas about health inequalities within policy</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Policy &amp; Politics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8c65241deefa75bc8b856b8d7eaef7cf"><gtr:id>8c65241deefa75bc8b856b8d7eaef7cf</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Smith K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cfacfac43031a8</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>44FDADF1-47AC-4D44-969D-6C6C5EB9B10E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Academic treadmills and the squeeze on intellectual spaces</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4d7d8c083a91e4f0b1516377b2aaca5a"><gtr:id>4d7d8c083a91e4f0b1516377b2aaca5a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Katherine Smith (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>r_6949596765cb3cb85c</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E62C77DE-F968-42EE-B0F1-B744AE5F6A1C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Fools, Facilitators and Flexians: Academic Identities in Marketised Environments</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Higher Education Quarterly</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8c65241deefa75bc8b856b8d7eaef7cf"><gtr:id>8c65241deefa75bc8b856b8d7eaef7cf</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Smith K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cfa4fa41738a44</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7FD417F9-7B0A-4487-ACD2-5ED6FDB971D2</gtr:id><gtr:title>What is known about tobacco industry efforts to influence tobacco tax?
