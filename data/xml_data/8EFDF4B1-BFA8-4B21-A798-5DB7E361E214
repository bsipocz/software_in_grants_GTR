'Dickens and Race', building on the current popular interest in Darwin, race and evolutionary science, will offer new perspectives on Dickens's writing engaging with race, empire and evolution. What did race mean for Dickens? How did he influence cultural perceptions of race? Given Dickens's widespread popularity, this extensive consideration will also offer new insights more generally into Victorian culture and into the historical relationship between conceptions of race and culture while pursuing the key research question, what is the relationship between the exotic, the rational and the scientific in Dickens's work? \n\nThe monograph will trace the interplay between science and the imagination through three key stages in Dickens's thinking about race, 1848, the mid-1850s and Dickens's final years. Underlying the project is the argument that Dickens's views on, and representations of, race were shaped by the twin poles of the development of science and fancy, in the form of travel narratives, the childhood favorites 'Robinson Crusoe' and 'Tales of the Arabian Nights' and the African travel narratives for which the adult Dickens had a particular 'insatiable relish'. However, the intersection of travel narratives with expanding empire produced the most problematic representations of race. The monograph will consider throughout the implication of statements made by Dickens, such as his claim in 'Nurse's Stories' (1860): 'I never was in Robinson Crusoe's Island, yet I frequently return there'. Focusing on what Dickens called 'the attraction of repulsion', this book identifies the footprints of these childhood texts in his work, showing how the exotic remained a site of fancy for Dickens throughout his life.\n\nOrganising the material around three key moments in Dickens's engagement with issues of race offers a full consideration of his changing views. Initially aligning himself with Chambers's view of 'Progressive Development', 1848 is a milestone for Dickens in which he finished 'Dombey and Son', wrote 'The Battle of Life', attended lectures on science, visited a Chinese Junk and an 'American Panorama', and wrote two key Reviews which manifested his interest in both the interrelationship of science and literature as well as the issues of empire and racial difference. The 1850s, which coincided with the lifespan of Dickens's journal 'Household Words', saw Dickens's attitudes to race, racial hierarchy and degeneration harden in response to difficulties in empire, particularly the Indian mutiny of 1857. At the time of his death in 1870, the monograph charts Dickens's response to the increasing cosmopolitanism within London produced as a result of colonial endeavor. Dickens was aware that the individualistic, liberal tendencies underlying contemporary debates regarding cosmopolitanism were threatening the sense of an English national identity. In 1870 Dickens wrote, in 'The Mystery of Edwin Drood', of the return of the Landless twins and their reception as symbolic of a larger issue; the solipsistic nature of English nationalism at the time signified a culture which had lost its life force, unable to renew itself. Dickens probed the real concern located within the heart of the cathedral town, Cloisterham (Rochester), a culture in degeneration. The East End of London seen earlier as a site of a degenerating race of urban poor was now the site of opium dens, fuelled by the illicit trade of empire. Such contact with empire was now seen as degenerative.\n\n'Dickens and Race' will spark interest in the historical understandings of race and the role literature plays as a cultural practice.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>'Dickens and Race' aims to provide a comprehensive consideration of Dickens's engagement with the development of scientific thinking specifically to do with race. The publication of this book during the bicentenary of Charles Dickens's birth will benefit from the heightened global interest in Dickens at the time. The impact of this book will be multi-faceted, directed towards young people from racially diverse backgrounds, the general public, Dickens enthusiasts and UK tourists. Through working in partnership with representatives from the education, library and museum sectors whose work engages with potential beneficiaries beyond academia, the impact of the research undertaken will be maximised. The impact activities will be directed primarily to three main areas: 1) education and careers; 2) open access libraries and 3) the cultural tourist industry, specifically museums. Listed below under these three headings are the immediate impacts produced by the research undertaken accompanied by further possible impacts stimulated by the publication of 'Dickens and Race'.\n\nWorkshops with Educators\nThe impact activity will be a workshop for educators, held just prior to the start of the bicentenary in order to raise awareness and to engage with teaching Dickens in the Twenty-First Century. 'Dickens and Race' will provide an opportunity to address current issues of race and race relations today by engaging with difficult legacies of literature with regards to diversity. In doing so, it will help to emphasise reading as a cultural practice as well as a private pleasurable activity. The outcome of which will be to enhance the confidence of both educators and young people to engage with debates surrounding race and the academy, contributing to their knowledge, to their sense of social cohesion and thus their quality of life. Engaging with issues of race and diversity in literature implies changes to curriculum at school and university levels that will raise new expectations and point to new career aspirations for those from racially diverse backgrounds.\n\nLibraries\nWorking with the British Library on a Bicentennial event to be hosted in their Exhibition Space or as an on-line exhibition will impact on the general public by raising awareness of Dickens's contributions to the historical legacies surrounding the conception of race and science more broadly. This exhibition will provide an inclusive perspective through which to understand Dickens and the Victorians more generally.\n\nWorking with the local public libraries within Wandsworth borough to host an exhibition and talk during Black History month which will engage the general public in an aspect of their cultural heritage, while using literature as a forum for the discussion of contemporary cultural issues.\n\nCultural Industry - Dickens House Museum\nWorking with The Dickens House Museum on an exhibition during Dickens's bicentenary year will provide a dimension to their work which may well draw in new audiences by offering new and relevant perspectives on Dickens. This will have an advantageous economic impact benefitting both the Museum and the local area.\n\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>75544</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Six short educational films on Dickens for the British Council produced as part of a global bicentenary celebration of Dickens.

The Dickens Day was a full day workshop attended largely by secondary school educators and the general public with an interest in Dickens. The day offered a full compliment of presentations on all aspects of Dickens, including a section on Dickens and race which disseminated the findings of my on-going research. The day sought not only to raise awareness of the forthcoming Dickens Bicentenary but to offer new ways of teaching and reading Dickens. The Dickens Day offered a day-long workshop during which those involved in secondary education and the general public were able to participate in a range of activities which included lectures, interactive workshops and a Dickens reading. The aim of the day was both to heighten awareness of the forthcoming Dickens Bicentenary and to introduce new ways of teaching and reading Dickens underpinned by leading research in the area of Dickens studies.

Significantly, these places he has never been are peopled with people whom he has never met, stereotypes of exotic racial difference. However, unlike his attraction to exotic imaginary places, Dickens's attraction to exotic peoples undergoes a significant change largely due to his avid adult engagement with the development of scientific thought which constructed notions of race largely in terms of civilisation and savagery. Dickens and Race argues that Dickens's views on, and representations of, race were shaped by the twin poles of the development of racial science and fancy, in the form of travel narratives, the childhood favourites Robinson Crusoe and Tales of the Arabian Nights and the African travel narratives for which the adult Dickens had a particular 'insatiable relish'. Dickens and Race offers a unique contextualisation of Dickens's fictional engagements with race in relation to his lesser-known journalism, with wider nineteenth-century debates about differences between humans, with issues of empire, and with the race shows of London. In addition to Dickens's journalism Dickens and Race will consider American Notes, Martin Chuzzlelwit, Dombey and Son, 'Perils of Certain English Prisoners, A Tale of Two Cities, Our Mutual Friend and The Mystery of Edwin Drood.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Dickens and Race is of use to those with an interest in: the development of scientific thought, specifically race; Victorian culture and empire; the inter-textuality of fictional and non-ficational writings.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A498B448-17F3-4223-A49D-3DF8473756C1</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544179750e3449.66504353</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/News-and-Events/Features/Pages/Exploring-Dickens-on-Race.aspx</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>CAAAAACC-D1AF-4B72-B18D-033FFF268F6B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Dickens and the Imagined Child</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ce9a70d1de089c836a9306dd6559033b"><gtr:id>ce9a70d1de089c836a9306dd6559033b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Professor Laura Peters</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781472423818</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>544173aaee51d8.72187569</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E4F274A1-9EF9-410F-A0AA-3FCA93E2182E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Dickens and Childhood</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6f322c1ef2fb134278e03d9ab7299509"><gtr:id>6f322c1ef2fb134278e03d9ab7299509</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Peters, Laura</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-4094-3041-4</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>i_36772887333c05e8a8</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>28C2434F-A00D-468E-AA72-5BBC47DA3773</gtr:id><gtr:title>Dickens and Race</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a3e22bad078cc8b3889a690ea8189002"><gtr:id>a3e22bad078cc8b3889a690ea8189002</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Peters</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780719064265</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>i_64970663133bf2e17c</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I001921/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FB301405-099D-44B9-ADA9-75B11FDED8C0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>English Language &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
