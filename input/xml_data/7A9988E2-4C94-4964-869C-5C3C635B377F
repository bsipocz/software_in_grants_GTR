In 2009, for the first time, the use of mobile phones was more prevalent than fixed-line phones across the UK. In 2008 a quarter of mobile subscriptions, or 17.9 million, were to new, high speed, 3G services. In the first quarter of 2009 more than 8 million people in the UK (16% of adults) access the internet on their mobile phones, an increase of 42% on the previous year. This growth has in part been driven by the increasing use of smartphones, which accounted for 16% of all handset sales in the first quarter of 2009, and the increasing use of mobile applications. In the first quarter of 2009 11% of households had a mobile connection but no fixed-line connection, however, and more significantly, 22% of households in socioeconomic group DE are mobile-only. If cultural heritage institutions aim to not only increase visitor numbers but broaden their visitor demographics beyond ABC1 socioeconomic groups then mobile compatible web sites will be a crucial component. This change in online access patterns is equally important for the HEI partners in the project if they are to fulfil their ambition of making the fruits of academic research more accessible to the general public.\n\nIn addition to broadening and increasing access the mobile interface to the 'Mapping Sculpture' database enables in situ research, exploration and discovery. This is a significant paradigm shift in the way all users (academic and non-academic alike), can encounter, explore and interpret the sculpture immediately in front of them: There is a limit to the amount of information that object labels and information boards can contain. Even the most comprehensive exhibition catalogue would struggle to convey the multiple and complex relationships that the Mapping project has discovered. Providing online access can overcome these problems and was one of the key drivers in providing an online, open access database in the original project. However, online access through fixed-line internet connections ties the user to their desk and dislocates the additional information from the object. Wireless internet connection through a laptop is one solution to this problem but is ultimately compromised by the variable availability of Wi-Fi hotspots, the bulk and expense of laptops and their still limited battery life in comparison to mobile phones.\n\nThe 'Mobilising Mapping' project will also enhance the functionality for users through the new mobile interface. The interface will add personalisation functionality enabling users to save information from the database into a personal folder. This enables users to build their own 'virtual collection' of records for later research, study or sharing. This service can combine reference to data on the project website with other online resources by providing the facility to share the record links via users existing research, study, social and networking structures such as delicious.com, Facebook, Digg and iGoogle thus further disseminating the valuable resources of the project.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>*Who will benefit from this research?\n\nThe beneficiaries of 'Mobilising Mapping' will include, but not be limited to, those already identified in 'Mapping Sculpture' (See 'Case for Support: Expected Usage of Digital Outputs, Databases and Resources'.) Public sector agencies such as those responsible for physical environment, planning and conservation; commercial/private/professional sectors including architectural practices, conservation businesses, the art market; the third sector (in particular museums galleries and related charitable organizations); media researchers working on arts programmes and publications; the wider educational sector (schools to FE); local communities and the general public.\n\nSignificantly, the mobile interface has the capacity to reach out to sections of society often considered hard to engage, such as audiences from the under 25s and over 65s and those from lower socio-economic sectors, for all of whom the mobile phone is becoming a ubiquitous means of access to information (see 'Case for Support - Research Context'). \n \n*How will they benefit from this research? \n\nThe mobile interface will be attractive to the users listed above: curators researching, cataloguing and disseminating collections and exhibitions and heritage workers documenting and managing the preservation of buildings and monuments. In the commercial/private sector and professional/practitioner groups (for example, architects, and those concerned with conservation/renovation of buildings and the urban environment) will benefit from the mobility of this research tool and the personalised research portfolio feature. This also applies to media and freelance researchers and to those from the wider education field. The latter will be able to utilise the search mechanisms when on group or individual study visits to augment and enrich aspects of the national curriculum. A broad section of the public interested in local, regional, family history as well as the creative arts can explore specific names, locations, business and the relationships between these. \n\n*What will be done to ensure that they have the opportunity to benefit from this research?\n\nThe Mapping Sculpture website and mobile interface will be actively promoted using social networking tools including Twitter and Facebook. The addition of convenient links to add the Mapping Sculpture site to all of the major social networking sites (including del.icio.us, Digg and iGoogle) will enhance public engagement.\n\nThe new mobile interface will be promoted on the University of Glasgow, V&amp;amp;A and HMI websites. Links with other institutions will be cultivated, with particular emphasis given to leveraging third sector organizations' existing dissemination channels and links with schools, colleges and industry.\n\n'Mobilising Mapping's' third sector partners (the V&amp;amp;A and the HMI) house the largest collections of sculpture relating to the period and geographic range of 'Mapping Sculpture' in the UK. Thus they provide a most effective and cost efficient means of raising awareness of this research amongst its target audience. The mobile interface will be advertised by using appropriate signage in exhibitions that coincide with the launch of 'Mapping Sculpture': Meetings - Materials - Maker' (V&amp;amp;A November 2010 - May 2011) and Mapping the Practices of Sculpture (HMI October 2010-October 2011). (See Impact Plan for further details of object availability and visitor numbers.) \n\nThe launch of the mobile interface will take place at the final 'Mapping Sculpture' conference (18-19 February 2011). This international event open to the general public as well as academic researchers will take place in the Sackler Wing of the V&amp;amp;A.\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-04-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>61462</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>an exhibition of 32 objects from the V&amp;amp;A in the Gilbert Bayes Gallery, Room 111 open to the public free admission</gtr:description><gtr:id>70B3C666-E9FC-4678-BF0B-7373C4F4C6F4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Disseminating the material basis of the projects 'Mapping Sculpture' and 'Mobilising Mapping' to the public through a designated display over a period of 6 months at the V&amp;amp;A</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>m_1458609569a70e5558</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Mapping Sculpture an exhibition of 32 objects at the V&amp;A, in the Gilbert Bayes Gallery, Room 111 which lasted from 12 November 2010 - 15 May 2011.</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2011</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Art UK</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>'Your Sculpture'</gtr:description><gtr:id>9BDA4D69-1776-44DD-8E96-CE27532D7BA8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>There are no formal outputs or outcomes from this collaboration at the development stage.

The rationale behind this development was that it would facilitate in situ engagement, exploration and research and enable users to collate and share their interaction with Mapping Sculpture through personalization features and social networking tools. Additional benefits would come through being able to engage the wider public in an innovative way, particularly new audiences outside academia, for whom mobile phone access is becoming ubiquitous. The latter was a particularly important consideration for the project's museum partners, the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Henry Moore Institute.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Further research needs to be undertaken on the uptake, viability and use of mobile devices for enhanced engagement and understanding within the museum and gallery context.

It documents c.3,500 sculptors, 2,750 related practitioners and 10,000 businesses (e.g. potteries and die-sinkers) adding substantially to the current knowledge base. Contextual entries on: 125 art schools; 120 art societies; 1,300 exhibitions; and 700 other events (e.g. sculpture courses and discussions) throw new light on the growth of art infrastructures and the connections formed by practitioners. Around 15,000 object records reveal the range of the sculptural object and 16,000 addresses for artists and businesses deliver substantial new geographic data. Drawing on the power of MySQL and PHP the Mapping Sculpture database uses state of the art technology to deliver optimal search functionality.</gtr:description><gtr:id>9711FDFE-677D-4D74-ADC5-0A18146854FB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Mapping Sculpture has a substantial international audience. Google Analytics shows that in the 12 months ending 30 September 2014, the site has been visited c.94, 000 times (close to 8,000 visits per month). Around two-thirds of these visitors were based in the UK, with the remaining third visiting from 160 countries around the world. Since the project's official launch in May 2011, over a quarter of a million unique visitors have accessed the site. The scope of visitor figures reflecting the international reach of sculptors and businesses through immigration and overseas activities. 

Over the last decade there has been an explosion of interest globally in local and family history facilitated by sites such as ancestry.com (launched 2002) and popularised by television series like Who Do You Think You Are? (which attracts audiences of over 6 million in the UK alone). The c.2,750 feedback emails received by the project have demonstrated Mapping Sculpture's value and importance for this growing community of historians. 

Feedback received since the database launch in 2011 has amply tested and validated the academic advantages of Mapping Sculpture's methodology. Amongst the scholarly outcomes resulting from information already received are: depth and detail added to numerous practitioner records; many new insights into business histories; and the disambiguation of around a hundred sculptors' identities. This fresh data has supported a range of undergraduate, post-graduate and academic research projects; answered many museum and archival collections enquiries; and provided assistance for heritage workers concerning preservation issues.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-1447155774.987447766d68fba</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>The projects primary output - A free access online database at http://sculpture.gla.ac.uk/ - contains over 50,000 records instead of c.6,000 entries as planned.</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://sculpture.gla.ac.uk/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2009</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2193E098-E6BF-49F9-B018-7A3EC234EFB5</gtr:id><gtr:title>in context: art history in an online environment</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Sculpture Journal</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/776dd613913c228c7e2ea167d73af4a1"><gtr:id>776dd613913c228c7e2ea167d73af4a1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Compton A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>54524516110a37.29946741</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7C3C6CAB-E6B2-48EA-99DB-5786E0CC363C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Reflecting on the technical development of the
