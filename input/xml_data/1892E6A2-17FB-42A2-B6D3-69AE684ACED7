What did Buddhism mean for Cage? And how did his understanding of Buddhist philosophy impact on his poetics and his representation of nature? Although Cage was among the first wave of post-war American artists and intellectuals to be influenced by Zen Buddhism, there is as yet no sustained critical text addressing his Buddhist poetics. &amp;quot;John Cage and Buddhist Ecopoetics&amp;quot; will address this critical gap, and contribute to recent academic and popular interest in Buddhist discourse and green issues.

My primary methodology is &amp;quot;ecocritical&amp;quot; in the sense that it explores the social, intellectual, economic and linguistic framing of nature in contemporary literature. A good example of ecocriticism can be found in J. Scott Bryson's anthology of essays &amp;quot;Ecopoetry: a Critical Introduction&amp;quot; (U of Utah P, 2002). However, Bryson's anthology tends to focus on ecological themes found in historical and contemporary &amp;quot;nature&amp;quot; literature, while downplaying or ignoring the importance of linguistic experimentation and innovative poetic form. In contrast to this thematic approach, my research is consistent with critical essays published in Brenda Iijima's &amp;quot;The Ecolanguage Reader&amp;quot; (Nightboat Books, 2011), a collection which considers how formal devices such as linguistic disjunction, semantic indeterminacy, and unorthodox syntax have become central to contemporary &amp;quot;ecopoetics.&amp;quot; One of the hallmarks of this alternative literary tradition is a tendency to call the primacy of the individual subject into question, and this tendency will be crucial to my discussion of Cage's specifically Buddhist version of ecopoetics. I will demonstrate that Cage's representation of subjectivity stems not only from the context of American experimental poetry, but also from the Buddhist doctrine of interdependence. To this end, the research will examine how Buddhist philosophy and environmentalism overlap and inform Cage's poetics. 

The ecocritical approach insures that the monograph and series of lectures will also add to the popular and scholarly understanding of contemporary environmentalist discourse. The research will consider the historical relationship between environmentalism and the influx of Buddhist Philosophy into the West during the later half of the 20th century, and situate Cage's early writing as a key site for the articulation of Buddhist and environmentalist thought. By focussing on the reception of texts by Cage in relation to other forms of Zen-influenced literature (most notably work written by his contemporaries associated with the Beat movement), I will argue that Cage's work &amp;quot;translates&amp;quot; the tradition of Buddhism to a contemporary Western setting. To what extent did his work provide an innovative form of Buddhist teaching, delivered to a particular social and aesthetic context? 

The research will contribute to Cage studies by addressing the congruence of literary experimentation, the emergence Western Buddhism, and environmentalist discourse that is present in his work. In its consideration of Cage's Buddhist ecopoetics, this research will impact academics and students, as well as members of the general public who are interested in Western Buddhism and green issues.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>John Cage and Buddhist Ecopoetics will provide a comprehensive consideration of Cage's engagement with formally innovative poetry and the development of Western Buddhism, with a special focus on ecological concerns. The publication of this book is timely due to the large degree of professional and social interest in the areas of Buddhism and environmentalism. The year 2012 is also Cage's 100th birthday, and the numerous international events celebrating his writing, art and music that year will increase public interest in his work. The book's impact will be multi-faceted, as it is directed towards scholars working in such diverse areas as literature, music, the visual arts, and religious studies, as well as to readers of contemporary poetry and to the non-specialist reader interested in Buddhism and/or environmentalism. 

Impact activities will be directed primarily to three main areas: 

1. Public Lectures at Prominent Art Galleries
I have been in contact with representatives of the Whitechapel Gallery in London and the Arnolfini Gallery in Bristol, both of whom have agreed to host lectures in 2012. John Cage was a writer, musical composer, and visual artist, and so my lectures will be especially pertinent in this context. Given the subject matter, my lectures may also draw in new audiences to each of these venues, thereby benefitting the galleries by increasing their outreach to the public. 

2. Buddhist Organizations
I will offer public lectures emphasizing the dissemination of Buddhism through poetry, thereby expanding the audience for my research outside of specific academic, literary and artistic contexts. The London Buddhist Society and the Oxford Zen Centre have both agreed to host and publicize public lectures on my research in 2012.

3. Local Community Organizations 
Because my research spans the areas of literary, ecological, and religious studies, I am in a unique position to offer new and relevant perspectives to on-going debates about environmental awareness. To this end, I have agreed to present research to local arts organizations such as the Bruton Arts Festival in Bruton, Somerset and the Kootenay School of Writing, a non-profit, collectively-run writers' organization in Vancouver, Canada. These lectures, which will be held in 2013, will have an advantageous economic impact benefitting both the organizations and the local areas in which they are situated. Another outcome of this activity is to enhance the knowledge and confidence of non-specialist audiences to engage in debates surrounding environmentalist discourse.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>66725</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Writing John Cage.&quot;</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>27FE7216-E4F6-4C63-8FC6-46756DACE3B8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Public lecture: &amp;quot; Whitechapel Art Gallery, London, UK.

He also held deep concerns about our increasing ecological crisis. What did Buddhism mean to Cage? And how did his understanding of Buddhist philosophy impact on his representation of nature? Cage was an innovator in many fields, and his exploration of new, performative ways to write indeterminate &amp;quot;poem-essays&amp;quot; parallel his similar explorations in music, visual art, and poetry. Following Cage's use of the I Ching, an ancient Chinese oracle which he used to determine compositional features such as the duration of sounds in music or the choice of words in writing, John Cage and Buddhist Ecopoetics employs an online random integer generator based on the I Ching to organize Peter Jaeger's critical prose. The result is a reconfiguration of writing and silence, in which oddly unfamiliar lacunae appear at pre-determined intervals according to the numerological system produced by the digital oracle. Jaeger further questions Cage's green-Zen by thinking through issues raised by contemporary psychoanalysis and cultural critique, and the book concludes with an analysis of Cage's turn towards anarchist politics in relation to his Zen Ecopoetics. The tension formed between discursive text and silence in John Cage and Buddhist Ecopoetics is fully intended to provide readers with a critically performative site for the Zen-inspired &amp;quot;nothing&amp;quot; which resides at the heart of Cage's poetics, and which so clearly intersects with his ecological writing.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Findings will be of use to researchers concerned with the Western spread of Buddhism, the history of ecological issues, John Cage Studies, and contemporary experimental poetics.
