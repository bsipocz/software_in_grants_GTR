Typically, Information Architecture techniques are applied in an attempt to improve a site's usability and the overall user experience by optimizing ``the structural design of an information space to facilitate task completion and intuitive access to content'' Although there are numerous principles and heuristics that have been developed, Information Architecture as a discipline, lacks formal models for evaluating or predicting whether such techniques will improve the usability of a website. In this project, we aim to develop formal models to measure, analyze and evaluate how easily a site can be navigated and the information within it can be retrieved. Such a model would provide a way to objectively measure what is colloquially termed, ``Ambient Findability'', i.e. the ease with which a given information object can be found. If the structure of a particular website precludes users from intuitively and easily locating key information, then in competitive online environments users are likely to abandon the site in favour of alternative sites that provide competing services or information. For example, online retailers need to ensure that users can quickly and easily find and locate the products and services offered along with related information such as product reviews, help files, and other supporting information. Consequently, the ability to determine or predict the findability of information objects such as key web pages is vital.

While various measures have been developed to objectively quantify how easily a user can navigate a website, or how easily a user can retrieve a particular page, =these techniques are often very coarse grained in nature. They ignore the needs or goals of users in their calculations which directly influence how easily a user could locate an object. They are agnostic to design in every sense, and thus ignore key issues such as layout, location and the visibility of links within web pages and the user's broader task context. Moreover, they assume each user is equally likely to select a given link (i.e. acting as a random surfer), and ignore well-known patterns and strategies of user behavior. Thus, they provide little value to practicing Information Architects who require more sophisticated, behavioral measures that accommodate these dimensions. To this end, this project will attempt to model more accurately the interaction of users with webpages and sites to provide an estimate of the probability of a particular page being found by different users groups with particular information needs/intentions.

The development of concrete mathematical and probabilistic models of findability and measures that capture the complex interactions of users, systems and information resources will be a significant achievement that will advance research and development into understanding behaviors, improving components and maximizing the findability of information. To determine the utility of these measurements, this project will take the theory out of the lab environment and evaluate the measures in operational settings with practicing Information Architects. This evaluation will provide external verification and validation of the theory and models developed to demonstrate how the measures can be deployed and utilized in practice.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research on findability is likely to be of benefit to a number of groups, where the main benefits are that end-users have improved access to information (i.e. relevant information is easier to find), clients delivering information services are ensuring that the content provided is findable (thus improving their quality of services), and for the designers and architectures, they will have the tools to objectively measure and quantify the impact of content and structure on the findability of information (and thus can determine whether changes to the content and structure will improve the quality of service or not, given the client's requirements and end-user information needs). Below we outline specific groups that are likely to benefit.
An immediate and direct beneficiaries will be the Industry Partner UXLabs - their core business is based around improving the quality of a website and ensuring that customer's find what they are looking for. The tools and techniques developed here will enable UXLabs to improve and streamline their business processes by providing new services to evaluate the findability of content on client websites. It is anticipated that these benefits will be realized during the course of the project.
Through the release of the Open Source Software Toolkit and Services other Information Architecture firms will also be able to directly benefit from this research and also improve the provision of their services. It is anticipated that early adoption of the technology would happen in the first year after the project.
Indirectly, the clients of these firms will benefit because Information Architects will be able to objectively evaluate the findability of information on client's websites. The expected benefits to clients will be continual monitoring of their sites and services in terms of findability, and improved websites which enables end-users to find what they are looking for. Since findability is intrinsically linked to consumption (i.e. if it is not findable, no one will buy it), then client sites are likely to benefit through increased online sales or consumption of online goods and services. Since there is high competition between online service and goods providers, then ensuring that those goods and services have the appropriate level of findability will be imperative for such providers to maximize profits.
While the measures and models of findability will be of interest to researchers and developers within Information Science, Human Computing Interaction and Information Architecture. This is because how users interact with information is a key part of these disciplines. These new models will provide insights into human behavior and provide a key development towards better understanding of information-interaction. Specifically this work will be of high relevance to Peter Morville, who first coined the idea of Ambient Findability. His work has been high influential, however, no formal models exist that enable its objective measurement. Information Architects, like Peter, will be able to utilize these models to evaluate how different architectures will impact upon site findability.
Industrial researchers such as Vinay Vishwa (Microsoft Research UK), Ed Chi (Google), Jeremy Pickens (Catalyst Repository Systems), and Gene Golochinsky (FX Palo Alto), have all expressed a strong interest in the research. These researchers are keen to see the results of this work and they have the capacity to incorporate them into their respective online products and web services (i.e. potentially millions of users). 

To put the tools in the hands of researchers we will enhance the impact, by providing tutorials and workshops to transfer this knowledge. Vishwa, Pickens and Golochinsky have all expressed interest in co-organizing a workshop on findability. With such researchers on board, this should attract a greater audience, in both academic and industrial circles.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-01-21</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>97376</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>A number of companies have used the findability measures developed to examine and explore how easily documents are to find within their systems in a variety of context e.g patents, people, archives, and news articles. Directly after the project finished, a 6 month follow on knowledge transfer project was initiated (Impact Accelerator Award), and findings from the project were implemented by Signal, a news start up company, where the recommendability of new articles was evaluated to ensure that the content processed was fully utilized. Numerous works have examined the retrievability of patents (e.g. Bashir &amp;amp; Rauber, 2017) to determine which algorithm expressed the least bias on the collection. Here, if some patents are not retrievable, then there could be serious legal and financial ramifications in missing a patent. In another case, an employment agency was particular interested in ascertaining whether the talent in their databases were being retrieved and recommended - and if not, why. This was particularly important in this context, because if they had potential candidates within which were not being retrieved, then it could lead to missed opportunities. While, in a recent study, (Samar et al, 2017), our measures were used to quantify the retrieval bias within web archives to identify retrieval algorithms which would facilitate the most access to the collection. This is important because the time and cost of archiving and indexing context is very high and thus would lead to wasting resources - but further, it would mean that end-users of the collections would not be able to easily access potentially useful and valuable information.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>5CF7657D-581A-40E6-81BF-B39F3D5CB50A</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56cb3498c7fda9.98096066</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software)</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>How easily it is to discover and find information when traversing the web depends on a number of factors. As part of this project, we developed models to measure how easily it is to find information. We then examined whether &amp;quot;hard to find documents&amp;quot; were used less, as a result. Indeed, it was possible to predict usage from our findability measures. 

We also found that if we can reduce the bias of a system (i.e. ensure that all documents are as retrievable as possible) that this correlates strongly with performance - that is a fairer system leads to better performance. This is very significant finding as there are many concerns over algorithmic bias - and this research provides a way to measure the bias and a strong case for addressing it.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>There are several ways in which the output of this research could be used.
1. to automatically evaluate the quality of a site/system and its influence on the collection 
2. to measure the algorithm bias of a system
3. to automatically tune and configure a retrieval system
4. to evaluate how easily documents are to find, and crucially what makes them retrievable</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>365C85E6-CCC2-4CBF-861C-A32F73F98FA8</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5469ed47ea22a2.99870416</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software)</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/K000330/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
