The disorder can be highly disabling for young people, causing marked disruptions to social functioning, schooling and family life. Without effective treatment, OCD typically persists into adulthood and is not only extremely costly for affected individuals but also for society as a whole. 

It is well-established that childhood OCD is influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, but a key question that remains largely unanswered is: what are the specific environmental experiences that lead to OCD? A number of researchers have suggested that certain aspects of family environment may play a role in the development of OCD. These include the way in which parents interact with their children (termed &amp;quot;parenting style&amp;quot;) and the mental wellbeing of parents. However, it remains unclear as to whether parenting style and parental mental health problems precede and predict the development of OCD in youth. This is crucial to ascertain because it could help clinicians to identify children who are at risk of developing OCD and offer targeted interventions to prevent the disorder from arising.

Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) is the first-line treatment for paediatric OCD, but it is only partially effective, with up to 6 in 10 young people failing to achieve a complete recovery. Identifying predictors of response is extremely helpful, as it can help researchers and clinicians to understand the barriers to recovery and develop new treatments to tackle these obstacles. Some recent research suggests that certain characteristics of parents might predict response to CBT for OCD in young people, but further work is needed to establish whether parenting style and parental mental health are important predictors.

During this fellowship at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology &amp;amp; Neuroscience (IoPPN), I will examine the role of maternal parenting style and mental health problems in the development and treatment of childhood OCD. Symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder exist on a continuum; in some studies I will examine the disorder while in others I will use quantitative measures of obsessive-compulsive behaviour (OCB).This research will take place under the supervision of Professor Thalia Eley, Professor Barbara Maughan, and Dr Fruhling Rijsdijk at the IoPPN, and Professor David Mataix-Cols at the Karolinska Institute, Sweden. 

I will undertake three studies using population-based data, including twin data, to test whether: a) maternal parenting style and mental health problems predict OCD in childhood; b) maternal parenting style predicts the development of OCB above and beyond any effect of genes; c) a two-way relationship exists between maternal parenting style and child OCB, whereby parenting style influences child OCB, but child OCB also shapes parenting style. In addition I will conduct a fourth study, involving the collection of new clinical data, to test whether objective measures of maternal parenting style and mental health predict response to CBT for OCD in young people. Taken together these results will have significant implications for the prevention and treatment of paediatric OCD.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>AIM: To investigate whether parental factors, including style of parenting and parental mental health, influence the development and treatment of paediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). 

OBJECTIVES:
1) Examine whether maternal parenting style and parental mental health in early childhood predict OCD in later childhood.
2) Establish if maternal parenting style and attitudes predict onset of obsessive-compulsive behaviour (OCB) in childhood, controlling for genetic influences.
3) Identify the direction of effects between maternal parenting style, parenting attitudes, and child OCB. 
4) Test whether maternal parenting style and psychopathology predict response to cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for OCD in youth.

METHODS:
Objective 1
Sample: Over 7,600 children and their mothers
Analyses: Linear and logistic regression models will test the extent to which parenting style and maternal psychopathology predict subsequent OCD symptoms, controlling for potential confounders.

Objective 2
Sample: Over 2,000 monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs and their mothers
Analyses: Linear regression models will test whether MZ differences in maternal parenting style and attitudes at age 4 predict MZ differences in OCB at age 7, controlling for OCB at age 4.

Objective 3
Sample: Approximately 6,000 twin pairs (MZ and dizygotic) and their mothers.
Analyses: Longitudinal phenotypic associations between maternal parenting style, attitudes and child OCB will be examined using genetically informative cross-lagged models.

Objective 3
Sample: 100 young people with OCD receiving CBT and their mothers. 
Analyses: Linear regression models will test whether maternal psychopathology and parenting style assessed at pre-treatment predict post-treatment OCD severity, controlling for potential confounders. 

SCIENTIFIC AND MEDICAL OPPORTUNITIES: Results may have far reaching implications for understanding the aetiology of paediatric OCD and its prevention and treatment.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM THIS RESEARCH?
Key stakeholders in research findings from this fellowship include: policy-makers, mental health clinicians, and children and their families. The results from this programme of research will potentially have far reaching implications for improving the prevention and treatment of OCD in youth. OCD affects approximately 2% of children and adolescents and is associated with significant morbidity, and therefore improvements in prevention and treatment will have a profound impact on the well-being of a large population of young people.

HOW WILL THEY BENEFIT FROM THIS RESEARCH?
This research will feed into two clinical priorities in the field of paediatric OCD, namely the delivery of targeted prevention and early intervention programmes, and the development of novel treatments to improve outcomes.

1) Targeted intervention: Research suggests that earlier treatment of paediatric OCD is associated with better outcomes. Furthermore, a growing body of research suggests that early intervention with cognitive behavioural prevention can limit the onset of anxiety disorders in children. Taken together, these findings highlight the value of identifying individuals at high risk of developing OCD. The proposed research will establish whether specific parental factors (parenting style and psychopathology), which are hypothesised to play a role in the aetiology of OCD, do in fact predict the development of OCD in youth. By exploring key environmental risk factors, the findings will assist in the development of targeted prevention programmes, using existing therapeutic techniques, for those who are most vulnerable to developing the disorder. 

2) Novel treatments: Cognitive behaviour therapy is the first-line psychological treatment for paediatric OCD in young people and is currently being rolled out in the UK as part of the Children and Young People's Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (CYP IAPT) initiative. However, CBT for OCD is only partially effective; approximately half of young people who receive CBT will be left with clinically significant symptoms after treatment. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines for OCD, published in 2005, highlighted as a research priority the need to investigate CBT involving parents or carers. However, it remains unclear how parents could best be involved and whether interventions aimed at parents could enhance outcomes in this population. By shedding light on the nature of the relationship between key parental factors and childhood OCD, the current research will inform the development of such novel treatment approaches.

WHAT ARE THE REALISTIC TIMESCALES?
It is anticipated the impact of this research on children and their families, mental health clinicians and policy-makers will be relatively rapid and achieved within 5-10 years of the output. In the short-term, the findings will need to be replicated and extended to ensure scientific rigour, and input would be required from mental health clinicians, patients and the public to consider the clinical significance and practical applications. In the longer-term, results will be communicated to policy-makers and treatment developers, in order to be translated into changes in clinical practice.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>294797</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation for OCD Clinic at the Maudsley Hospital</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DECF9601-5B5C-4198-A9D4-B027700D79A4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presented results of study examining association between parenting and the development of OCD in youth, to a group of approximately 15 clinicians (psychiatrists and psychologists).
