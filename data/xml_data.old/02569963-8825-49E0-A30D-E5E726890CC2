strand</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/N003683/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Our aim is to enable policy-makers at all levels to target their decisions at improving the subjective wellbeing of their client group. The decision-makers we have in mind include those in central and local government, the NHS, schools, third sector organisations and private businesses. We shall do this partly through face-to-face interaction and partly through written analysis of evidence and new methods of policy evaluation.

Initial consultation

During the development phase, our first step will be a large, open event in October to which users are invited as well as members of other WWCW strands. We shall invite participants to say what they would hope for from us and we in turn will outline our proposed approach for comment. This 2-way flow will continue throughout the programme, on our website and face to face, with policy-makers raising important research issues and researchers responding. 

Interaction with users

We propose five types of face-to-face interaction, all video recorded and made available online. The first is a series of one-day courses for users in different parts of Britain, covering all the main issues. The second is a weekly seminar in which (at alternate sessions) users are invited to present their problems and receive advice and support on their analyses. Third, we shall run four half-day workshops on the analysis and evaluation of longitudinal data and, fourth, three one-day courses on economic evaluation. Finally there will be a major 2-day conference co-organised with the OECD, at which we will present our manual on &amp;quot;wellbeing for policy-makers&amp;quot; - see below.

Synthesis of evidence and methods of evaluation

For policy-makers to aim at subjective wellbeing they need, first, an organised body of knowledge which tells them in a user-friendly way how different factors affect wellbeing. All effects have to be measured in a common currency which measures subjective wellbeing. At present such evidence using a common currency is scarce, but Britain is rich in cohort data which make it possible to look at the effect of all factors simultaneously using a common currency. We shall exploit these data, as well as synthesizing all the existing evidence. 

Second policy-makers need a framework for analysing their own policy options, by using the above evidence plus the results of experiments, in order to identify their most cost-effective options. We shall therefore develop a new, alternative Green Book to that now used in the Treasury (where money is the measure of benefit) and we are discussing this with the Treasury. To illustrate the power of this approach we shall then apply it to new or ongoing experimental interventions in schools, home-visiting, adult personal development, the provision of NHS psychological therapy, and the prevention of loneliness in old age.

All this work will be put together in the manual on &amp;quot;wellbeing for policy-makers&amp;quot; which we shall present at the conference co-organised with the OECD, as our contribution to the work of the OECD Consortium of model-builders of wellbeing, for which we have been selected as the British component.

We believe passionately that a shift in the focus of decision-making is possible and that new evidence and frameworks of analysis exist which make this possible. The cross-cutting strand can provide invaluable leadership in this change, by providing an outstanding manual on evidence and decision analysis and by ongoing two-way interaction between researchers and decision-makers. This will surely lead to higher levels of wellbeing throughout our society.

More details are given in the Case for Support.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>1. The beneficiaries we aim to interact with are
public sector organisations (central, local and NHS)
schools
third sector organisations
businesses
general public
other academics, whom we can tempt to work on wellbeing, and
other strands of the WWCW.

2. To build links and contacts at the concept and development phase, we shall hold a 1-day open event at LSE, at which we shall invite views as to what users need, and propose our own plans for meeting their needs (for open discussion). This two-way knowledge-exchange dialogue will continue throughout the project via our programme blog and website.

3. We shall then attempt to interact with users mainly face to face (or via videos) through

- 5 one-day courses in different locations.
- A weekly seminar at LSE where users will be invited (at alternate sessions) to present their problems and analyses and have feedback - with the aim of co-producing new knowledge.
- Four half-day workshops on cohort analysis.
- Three one-day courses on economic evaluation.
- A major international conference in London co-hosted with the OECD.

4. We shall also produce a user-friendly manual on the state of knowledge, providing ready access for decision-makers. We shall also undertake evaluation of a range of wellbeing-relevant interventions, using the new methodology that we propose for cost-effectiveness analysis.

This workshop aims to explore ways in which this data can be used more to inform wellbeing research in the wider community.

About the workshop
In partnership with the What Works Centre for Wellbeing, the Centre for Longitudinal Studies (CLS) is hosting a one-day workshop exploring the ways in which data sourced from longitudinal birth cohort studies can be used to inform wellbeing research. In addition to discovering what datasets and measures are currently available, delegates will find out about the latest research, and gain a first-hand insight into how use these datasets during a live methods and data demonstration.

This workshop is open to all those interested in using cohort data to analyse wellbeing, in particular we welcome policymakers, third sector representatives and academics wanting to undertake well-being research using cohort studies. The workshop will be aimed primarily at new data users, but experienced users are also welcome.

Understanding the key determinants of people's life satisfaction will suggest policies for how best to reduce misery and promote wellbeing. This column discusses evidence from survey data on Australia, Britain, Germany, and the US which indicate that the things that matter most are people's social relationships and their mental and physical health; and that the best predictor of an adult's life satisfaction is their emotional health as a child.

Organised by OECD, CEPREMAP, What Works Centre for Wellbeing , and CEP
(Monday 12 - Tuesday13 December 2016)

The conference on 12-13 December 2016 presented the latest findings of research on the determinants of subjective well-being over the life course and included leading international policy-makers and policy-analysts reflecting on the evidence and how to use it in the real world. The meeting included international speakers from the OECD, USA, France, Germany, Sweden, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, with high-level panellists from the UK government and German Chancellery. And keynote addresses by Lord Gus O'Donnell, Prof Jeffrey Sachs, Mari Kiviniemi, OECD Deputy Secretary General and Prof Alan Krueger.

Over 250 participants took part and the conference received wide public attention. Our findings featured on the BBC Today programme, and Sky News, 12 local and regional radio stations, as well as in the Financial Times, The Daily Telegraph, and the Guardian. Most significant of all it was for eight hours one of the four headline items on the BBC News website. It was also picked up by media outlets worldwide. This media campaign was supported by a readable blog piece on VoxEu.

A GES/R Event in collaboration with the Social Impacts Task Force &amp;amp; What Works Centre for Well-being
23rd October 2015 10:00 to 12:00 - HMT Auditorium

Background
The Prime Minister launched the Measuring National Well-being Programme in 2010. The clear aspiration at launch was to go beyond measurement and for the new statistics to be a means to an end for government in taking 'practical steps' to ensure our decisions are very much focussed on quality of life. Most recently the Prime Minister, at the first cabinet meeting of the new government, challenged ministers to ensure &amp;quot;every decision we take, every policy we pursue, every programme we start&amp;quot; gives everyone the best chance of &amp;quot;living a fulfilling and good life&amp;quot;. But practically how do we build the wealth of research on well-being into our decision making? What are the tools we need and where are the evidence gaps?
Last year the government established an independent What Works Centre to answer these questions - bringing together the best academic minds and think tanks for a three year programme. Come along to this event to learn more about the progress that is being made and to have your say on the work of the centre so that it delivers the economic and social research tools that can help you in your day job.

Happiness depends on health and friends, not money, says new study
Landmark research says tackling mental health issues more effective than reducing poverty for increasing happiness rates. Extra spending on reducing mental illness would be self-financing, the researchers added, because it would be recovered by the government through higher employment and increased tax receipts together with a reduction in NHS costs from fewer GP visits and hospital A&amp;amp;E admissions.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c7e7cb2b8fd7.77222804</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Media (as a channel to the public)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://cep.lse.ac.uk/_new/news/programme.asp?resprog=9</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited speaker: UK Government Social Impact Task Force (Multiple meetings)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3EB063AE-0587-4916-A509-06E163C0421D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>UK Government Social Impact Task Force (Multiple meetings), Cabinet Office</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d6e350f1c6f7.85262109</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Meeting with Stakeholders (Cost-effectiveness Analysis)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7C20898B-2B3A-4285-B8AC-D8A411C78450</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Meeting with Gus O'Donnell, Richard Layard, Martin Knapp and Joseph Lowe (HM Treasury) on 13 January 2016, together with What Works Centre for Wellbeing Strand Representatives to discuss methods of analysing the cost-effectiveness of wellbeing interventions.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cd928e76c144.19115672</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Online article: Linking work and health: the What Works Centre for Wellbeing (Personnel Today, 23 December 2015)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>ADF5AFC8-00FA-43C0-8AB3-A3172F4E7F3B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>&amp;quot;Cross-cutting capabilities: This project is being led by Professor Lord Richard Layard of the London School of Economics and will assess and develop methods of understanding how policy and practice can affect wellbeing.

The role of well-being in public mental health is a subject that is being discussed widely in academic, policy and clinical circles, but there is concern that these discussions have become more of a mantra within policy making rather than an evidence-based reality.

The overall objective of the conference will be to provide a safe forum for researchers, practitioners, service users, NHS representatives, charities, students and funders to exchange views and talk constructively about the contested boundaries of well-being in public mental health and discuss options for improving the situation going forward.

The key questions that will be addressed during the panel sessions are: 

? What is the relationship between 'mental health' and 'well-being'? 

? What is &amp;quot;wellbeing&amp;quot;?

? What evidence is there on promoting resilience in mental health? 

? What is our approach to the use of evidence in mental health policy?

? What is the role of psychiatry in public mental health?

? How are mental health variations of importance measured and experienced?

? Taking things forward and working together - the future of public mental health

The Wellbeing Group in the Centre for Economic Performance is writing a comprehensive analysis of wellbeing over the life-course. The aim is to do this in a way that can really help policy-makers, together with a new form of CBA. We will present a very first draft of the book in a one-day conference on Friday 29 July 2016, followed by a reception.

Professors Andrew Clark, Nick Powdthavee and Andrew Steptoe will present further findings for our report &amp;quot;Paths to Wellbeing&amp;quot;, aimed at building an overall model of wellbeing over the life-course.

From its inception in 1999 NICE's decision making has used the health-related quality of life adjusted life year (QALY) which captures both the length and aspects of quality of life (QOL) that are related to health. Historically the EQ5D questionnaire has been NICE's preferred method to calculate the QALY because it was the only one to have a UK value set (tariff) enabling it to be used in cost-utility analysis.
Whilst there are inherent limitations in all available measures, the role of the QALY and the EQ5D in national access decisions has focussed scrutiny. The challenges have included a lack of sensitivity and that not all the outcomes that are important are captured, particularly for public health and social care interventions. An intervention may be financed by one sector and have additional benefits in others which are not captured and there is no consistency in decision-making. Therefore methodological development is required.
To inform the future research agenda addressing cross-sector decision making, a meeting was held at the MRC on 14th July 2015 attended by representatives of various academic institutions, patient organisations, NICE, the Department of Health, NIHR, health charities, What Works in Wellbeing, the Cabinet office and the Medical Research Council. There were presentations on the MRC research grant process, NICE's approach to science policy development and current difficulties faced by NICE. An overview of the current methods available for cross sector benefit measurement commissioned by the MRC was presented and a summary given from the social care perspective. The presentations were followed by discussion.
During the meeting, there were a number of emerging themes that can be categorised into three overlapping topics:
1. Foundational questions of valuation and decision-making - the underlying value judgements that need to be made to construct and utilise a benefit measure suitable for decision- making.

Most human misery is due not to economic factors but to failed relationships and physical and mental illness. Eliminating depression and anxiety would reduce misery by 20% while eliminating poverty would reduce it by 5%. And on top of that, reducing mental illness would involve no net cost to the public purse.

Among the findings on the key determinants of people's life satisfaction:

? Income inequality explains only 1% of the variation in happiness in the community, while mental health differences explain over 4%. Education has a very small effect on life satisfaction, compared with, for example, having a partner.

? When people evaluate their income or education, they generally measure it against the locally prevailing norm. As a result overall increases in income or education have little effect on the overall happiness of the population: if my relative income rises, someone else's must fall, and the average is unchanged. This helps to explain why in Britain, Germany the United States, and Australia, average happiness has failed to rise since records began, despite massive increases in living standards.

? The strongest factor predicting a happy adult life is not children's qualifications but their emotional health. There is also powerful evidence that schools have a big impact on children's emotional health, and which school a child goes to will affect their emotional wellbeing as much as it affects their exam performance.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Re-prioritisation of policies</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0D40CA26-0124-4FED-8051-16EF309C5F2A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d95fc16f4721.30216888</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AF07354A-0C9F-4CAA-A371-D87AAF176542</gtr:id><gtr:title>Happy People Have Children: Choice and Self-Selection into Parenthood.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>European journal of population = Revue europeenne de demographie</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6c5a018450a00973bec244a99b7033ed"><gtr:id>6c5a018450a00973bec244a99b7033ed</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cetre S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0168-6577</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58b8459ddb1715.94808996</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6698FB46-1C53-4140-B94D-6888215624DA</gtr:id><gtr:title>World Happiness Report 2017</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ce288ba79f749bda786cd05597d8fdbb"><gtr:id>ce288ba79f749bda786cd05597d8fdbb</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Layard, R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c7eaefb4e7d6.49568050</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>152D03CB-BE6A-48A2-BCF4-C0AA80580866</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Origins of Happiness: The Science of Well-Being over the Life Course</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/46ff1756e4b3af3aa6c221c1094ea42f"><gtr:id>46ff1756e4b3af3aa6c221c1094ea42f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Clark Andrew E.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>0691177899</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>5a9fd58700c436.44449158</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D9BC5148-6B8A-42C6-9C21-90B96520D25F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Do More of Those in Misery Suffer from Poverty, Unemployment or Mental Illness?</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Kyklos (Online)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9785b1ce0b595e7afc32455c31a00e65"><gtr:id>9785b1ce0b595e7afc32455c31a00e65</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Fl?che S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0023-5962</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58b8466b9eea23.98928766</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>CBDE2C5A-9737-4221-BD99-1611F61CB577</gtr:id><gtr:title>(forthcoming).
