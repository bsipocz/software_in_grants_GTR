Owing to the dearth of individuals who can take advantage of large biological data sets, we have decided to focus the UK's ELIXIR node on training.

This is the century of biology, and genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics ('omics and bioinformatics) lie at its heart. The computer is an essential tool and now drives many critical aspects of the scientific process hence scientists need to know how to gain most advantage from it. Despite the central role of computing in science today:

- Most research scientists are ill-equipped to take advantage of the data 'bonanza' that is emanating from new technologies. Critical training needs across the community are, broadly, in the analysis and the interpretation of genome-scale data of many types, including next generation sequencing (NGS) data. Genomics is the area of greatest training need as it lies at the intersection of many fast-moving research disciplines.

- Many infrastructure technologists (career bioinformaticians) are ill-equipped to offer scalable, sustainable solutions for managing and interpreting data arising from this flood of technological advances. Critical training needs are in techniques and practices for data management, integration, compute and software, tools, services and standards.

The ELIXIR-UK Core Organisations are: the Universities of Oxford, Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham, and Edinburgh; the NERC Environmental Omics Synthesis Centre; the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute; the Genome Analysis Centre; and, University College London. Additional participating organisations are: the Software Sustainability Institute UK; the Hartree Centre; and the University of Dundee. Other organisations (UK and ELIXIR-wide) will be incorporated to provision training.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The Node's training mission will be delivered in four ways:

(a) The organisation of training through ten cooperating Training Sectors where UK skills are strong, training needs have been identified, and training capabilities already exist. Each sector is led by established researchers in their fields, and many co-operations between the Sector Leads already exist. Each Sector Lead is responsible for: (i) representing the sector at initial Training the Trainers (TTT) events; (ii) organisation of an initial workshop that performs a training gap analysis for the sector, and (iii) fund-raising for resources that aim to plug these training gaps. 

(b) These training gaps will also be filled by trainers' skills being developed by workshops that exchange ideas and best practice among sectors. ELIXIR-UK will be particularly supportive of training delivered at the
interface between different sectors. Existing training resources will be collated and new training materials
developed and disseminated at every opportunity.

(c) The development of a pilot Training e-Support Service platform that will seek, among other things, to offer the crucial means of registering and discovering training materials, face-to-face training opportunities
and training-relevant resources, and will progressively deliver forms of training online. A feasibility study will
be undertaken on whether pipelines could be developed to permit ELIXIR trainers to disseminate their own
training content on-line, whilst maintaining a separate copy in their home training institution.

(d) Development, management and monitoring of outcomes of the training activities through three posts who (i) support the Training Sector Leads, (ii) coordinate the redefinition of of training agendas with UK scientists, industry, grant-giving bodies and other ELIXIR Nodes, and (iii) will foster, mentor and support the community of trainings, across all sectors, in the UK and Europe.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>For Academic Impact please see 'Academic Beneficiaries'.

Industrial Impact.
Industry has a critical requirement for data sources, data integration, visualization and analysis tools, and for training related to these, across the broad spectrum of data types relevant to life sciences. The ELIXIR WP3 industry report refers to: protein and nucleotide sequencing; genomic information; genetic variation; small molecules; proteomics; transcriptomics; macromolecular structures; scientific literature analysis; ontologies or controlled vocabularies; and pathway and interaction information. In the pharmaceutical, consumer goods, consumer markets and agri-food sectors small molecule data, protein sequence and structure, as well as pathways are of critical importance. Genomic data, genomic variation, and links to phenotypes are important in plant and animal breeding. Food security can only be supported by scientifically driven research and by making the fruits of this research available to academic, governmental and industrial scientists. 

Scientists in large companies, medium and small size organizations can be overwhelmed by the complexity and volume of data. Repetition of in house custom solutions is not cost effective so a new landscape of pre-competitive collaborations is emerging. Training in understanding ranges of data types, interactions and agile integration are prerequisites for efficient industrial research. Tools such as semantic web data integration techniques, controlled vocabulary / ontology definition and metadata capture are key for modern data driven biological research but adoption of these techniques in industry will require education and training. 

ELIXIR-UK will engage with industry in a number of ways:
- through industry organisations such as EFPIA, Pistoia (Pharma), and BioNOW (BioTech SMEs), systematically developing those links to inform its training content and training methods;
- awareness raising in industry of ELIXIR tools and resources, and providing training in them;
- packaging platform distributions such as BioLinux in other informatics sectors, such as cheminformatics;
- using industry for provisioning training and hosting training events;
- brokering access to high-end training needs in ICT literacy (e.g. HPC).

Societal impact:
Manchester specifically focuses on: the development of the Training e-Support Service; the adaptation and rollout of Software Carpentry (www.software-carpentry.org, &amp;quot;Helping scientists build better software since 1998&amp;quot;) across UK and European Life Science; and in the oversight of the technical infrastructure aspects of ELIXIR-UK. 

As ELIXIR is an *infrastructure* programme the impact of the work proposed - to ensure better e-infrastructure - is significant: 
- on the quality, robustness, reliability, sustainability and fidelity of software and software services contributing to the infrastructure;
- on the ability of the bioinformatics and developer community to adopt and adapt ELIXIR infrastructure and software from elsewhere;

The importance of better and more reproducible and reusable software has been recognised in the Life Sciences in recent years (e.g. Nature 467, 775-777 (2010), Computational science: ...Error ...why scientific programming does not compute). ELIXIR-UK is an opportunity to affect change and affect new and better practice.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-03-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-03-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>192113</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Oxford</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Oxford E-Research Centre</gtr:department><gtr:description>Oxford eResearch Centre</gtr:description><gtr:id>ACE0FF3A-9081-44B0-A79B-D3B190CCA2BB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>see outcomes of: SysMO-DB2, DMMCore: Data and Model Management Core for ERASysAPP &amp;amp; Europe, and Delivering ELIXIR-UK</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56db29c21c9266.01664356-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>- For the FAIRDOM project (BBSRC SysMO-DB1, SysMO-DB2, DMMCore) we use the OeRC ISA Structure as the backbone of the SEEK4Science software we use for the FAIRDOMHub Commons.

TeSS (life sciences training portal, https://tess.elixir-uk.org) aggregates links to disparate training events and materials, scattered across ELIXIR Nodes and other training portals, and makes them centrally discoverable.

Aggregation is effected automatically, via custom-built scripts that scrape training metadata descriptors (title, description, prerequisites, goals, categories, keywords, contributors, audience, etc.) from participating websites. This task is made difficult by the lack of consistency in training pages' structures and lack of agreement on training metadata descriptors.

In the past year, we helped initiate the BioSchemas Working Group, which aims to reach consensus among life-science communities in defining metadata standards for describing training resources. BioSchemas are extending specifications from Schema.org, reusing existing metadata standards. This is in line with Google and other major search engines, which already utilise Schema.org's schemas for search optimisation. 

We have also started to actively promote the use of 'bioschemas' among content providers. A first follower was GOBLET, whose training portal has embedded the new BioSchemas-proposed mark-up within their training pages. Ultimately, our goal is for all content providers to adhere to the agreed schemas, making the job of search engines more efficient, and scrapers redundant.

Our next immediate task is to increase the content from ELIXIR Nodes, and to further promote take-up of the evolving 'bioschemas'. At the same time, to make further efficiency gains and broaden the scope of the resource, we are partnering with the emerging US BD2K's Training Coordination Centre, which has a similar remit to that of TeSS, sharing expertise, training resources and technical know-how.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c7c23dd7df59.25363273</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.iscb.org/cms_addon/conferences/ismb2016/posterlist.php</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>ELIXIR Train-the-Trainers workshop, Lausanne (CH), January 2017.</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D97A86CD-F5A4-449D-B0D3-2BD6C38B7ECA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The 5th ELIXIR-EXCELERATE Train-the-Trainer (TtT) pilot course will take place on 16-18 January 2017 in Lausanne, Switzerland.

BD2K is an initiative of the U.S. National Institute of Health to establish a digital ecosystem for biomedical research. The All Hands Grantee Meeting held on 12-13 November 2015 in Bethesda, Maryland, brought together all participants and grantees in BD2K. Carole Goble (ELIXIR UK Node) attended as an ELIXIR representative. Also attending from ELIXIR were Janet Thornton, Susanna Sansone and Henning Hermjakob. Susanna and Henning are investigators on BD2K awards.

Around 350-400 people attended the meeting over the two days. The range of grantees is impressive - a number of early career and established cyber-infrastructure and computing specialists as well as the expected biomedical investigators and computational biomedicine researchers.

BD2K is a $100 million per annum coordinated programme of work, and the range and ambition is impressive. The progress is visible already after the first year, and there was a positive vibe of a real opportunity for change. The two days was an agenda of plenary talks, posters, demos, breakout sessions, and programme meetings, including a plenary ELIXIR presentation by Janet and Carole, which was very well received and raised awareness of ELIXIR work among the US bioinformatics community.

They are often spread across different institutional websites, personal blogs, or stored in archives. This means you have to know exactly what you are looking for, and where to find it. However, for many, training occurs when the person knows little about the subject they wish to train in. This makes it difficult to know what material they need to look for. Once it is identified, it is also difficult to know what quality others within the community rate that material. To solve this problem for European Bioinformatics, we have generated the TeSS Portal. TeSS aggregates links to disparate training materials and events scattered around the institutional websites of ELIXIR Nodes and other content providers (GOBLET, Software and Data Carpentry, EBI TrainOnline, Genome3D, on-course, and more.), making them centrally discoverable and searchable. Training resources within TeSS can be collected and arranged into packages and/or training workflows, forming graphical representations of scientific pipelines in order to organise resources into easily navigable views. Aggregation of training content happens automatically through a set of custom-made nightly-run scraper scripts. Scrapers use a number of techniques to extract information: HTML-scraping and APIs had been the predominant methods, but are either temperamental or scarcely found respectively. More recently we have focused on parsing structured schema.org mark-up data. The TeSS team, through the Bioschemas group, have been heavily involved in developing schema.org specifications for Life science training resources and promoting their adoption</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c7cc8d200cb5.83362070</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://fair-dom.org/knowledgehub/webinars-2/niall-beard/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>ELIXIR BioSchemas Implementation study kick-off meeting, Hinxton (UK), March 2017</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>12ECFC07-006A-4B65-9A80-1B7CC47F0B97</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The ELIXIR Bioschemas project has 4 stages: planning, agreement, adoption and implementation.

One solution to this problem is to adopt Schema.org mark-up. Schema.org is a community initiative supported by four major search-engine providers: Google, Bing, Yahoo and Yandex. It provides a simple way to publish data in a standard format. If websites publishing life-science training materials, data, tools, profiles etc. were to use Schema.org mark-up, then their websites could be crawled, and the data could be indexed and exposed in searchable portals. However, this approach has challenges. Bioschemas is a newly formed community group in the life sciences to address these challenges, aiming to make the adoption of Schema.org part of a powerful way to discover and collect life-science information. It produces specifications, one for each information type ('Training Course', 'Event', 'Sample Data', 'Ontology Term', 'Tool', etc.). Each specification lists the Schema.org minimum properties expected, and the constraints for each property: for example, the 'Events' specification that the property 'topic' should be an EDAM ontology topic. The specifications are developed openly and are available on GitHub, with the support of existing communities of domain experts. Bioschemas also identifies the types or properties that are needed in the life sciences but not present in Schema.org, and works with the community to encourage the adoption of these types and properties into Schema.org.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c7e8f5ae01a6.38388141</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://f1000research.com/posters/5-2296</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>GOBLET Standards Committee webinar, March 2017</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>13BE2C71-624F-42CD-BA78-AA5C938FC70D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A discussion of the different metadata standards used in TeSS and in Bioschemas, and how that compares to GOBLET</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c7d1d4c54347.43836694</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>296000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>European Union (EU)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>EUR</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>Austria</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>de_AT</gtr:currLang><gtr:department>Horizon 2020</gtr:department><gtr:description>CORBEL, Coordinated Research Infrastructures Building Enduring Life-science services</gtr:description><gtr:end>2019-08-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>European Commission</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>INFRADEV-4-2014-2015, 654248</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>311E8450-55DF-4085-8E85-A7D4B6689537</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56db13db2cf612.91429335</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-09-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>540000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>European Union (EU)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>EUR</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>Austria</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>de_AT</gtr:currLang><gtr:department>Horizon 2020</gtr:department><gtr:description>ELIXIR-EXCELERATE</gtr:description><gtr:end>2019-08-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>European Commission</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>INFRADEV-3-2015, 676559</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>DBAD595E-5A40-49CC-8463-B5D60A7501F8</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56db1319841161.15802351</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-09-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>ELIXIR UK, a part of the ELIXIR community, is taking a UK and European lead in training. ELIXIR UK's aim, to facilitate access to training in UK and across Europe for scientists in both academia and industry, will allow researchers to combine their experimental expertise with available computational infrastructure to address critical research questions. Only then will biological Big Data be transformed efficiently into meaningful results that lead to new discoveries and innovations.

To achieve this, ELIXIR UK is identifying training needs across the UK and European life sciences sector, and fill these training gaps by developing a new training strategy together with scientists, specialised centres and key organisations. ELIXIR UK will also support international collaborations to bring together scientists from academia, industry and other organisations from all over Europe - together filling skills gaps, strengthening science across Europe, and setting the agenda for training needs in the future.

ELIXIR-UK now co-leads the ELIXIR Training Platform (all 21 nodes participate) and co-runs the ELIXIR-EXCELERATE WP on training. 
ELIXIR-UK has established the TeSS Training Portal for ELIXIR and rolled out a programme of Software and Data Carpentry training across the ELIXIR nodes and in the UK in partnership with the UK's Software Sustainability Institute.
