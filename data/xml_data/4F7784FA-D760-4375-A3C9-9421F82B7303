Later-medieval England saw relations between the Crown and its subjects evolve in the wake of a distinctive period of growth in Angevin government over the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. The legal and governmental structures of the state were now familiar enough to give many individuals a sense of what it meant to be a subject of the Crown and we can identify meaningful abstract concepts of subjecthood before the profound dislocation of the Wars of the Roses put these concepts to the test. Historians have understandably focused on the civil wars of the fifteenth century as a crucial point when the collective identity of the medieval populous as subjects was modified, using rich source collections including the Paston and Plumpton correspondence and the political writing of Sir John Fortescue. However, these were ideas which had evolved over the previous century, and which deserve more rigorous and nuanced study than they have hitherto received.
My study focuses of four main areas: 'rights and remedies', 'conflict and consensus', 'identities' and 'places'. Each of these sections will draw on the most recent work in a number of different disciplines, in order to ask new questions of previously neglected source collections: why did idealised notions of a personal relationship between subject and monarch persist in the judicial sphere, despite the exponential growth in institutional processes and legal documents? How did subjects express opinions or dissent concerning matters of national government? What were the 'languages of antagonism' through which these ideas were expressed? How were dominant discourses of subjecthood internalised, shaped and adapted by individuals and by groups of subjects? Did the concept of a capital city create a new sense of distance in the relationship between the Crown and people? How were tensions between the centre at Westminster and the localities expressed?
My work on the collections of medieval petitions and writs at The National Archives will examine the ways in which these ideas were expressed through the pens of scribes and county lawyers on behalf of individual petitioners and communities. Recent work on the collections of more than 17,000 medieval petitions; several thousand habeas corpus writs and thousands of pardons demonstrate the potential for new research. My study will also explore the ways in which the relationship between the Crown and its subjects was represented in outlaw ballads, ceremonial performance (royal audiences and pageants performed in towns and cities during the king's itineration around his realm) and in royal art and architecture. This project also maps the ways in which people interacted with the seat of government at Westminster by using Chancery and Exchequer records to chart the frequent journeys undertaken between Westminster and the shires of England. 
This study demonstrates the utility of bringing together late medieval and early modern scholarship, in order to establish a broader understanding of pre-modern subjecthood as a whole. Early modern historians are increasingly recognising the need for more imaginative analyses of the relationships between rulers and ruled. This study demonstrates the ways in which legally endorsed ideals about the rights and obligations of both rulers and subjects were adapted and negotiated in practice. My research will be disseminated through a book, articles in scholarly journals and history magazines, teaching materials and public lectures. It is hoped that this project will form part of an international and interdisciplinary research programme on pre-modern subjecthood.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>*Who will benefit from this research? 

This research will not only benefit a wide range of academics, but will also promote the work of The National Archives and engage the interest of amateur historians and the wider public. The public interest in medieval history can be seen in the popularity of books and television and radio programmes on this period. Cultural history, in particular, which draws on a range of sources from the legal and governmental to the literary and art historical, has the capacity to capture the popular imagination. Organisations which promote amateur history, such as The Historical Association, the local Oxford Historical Society and the Centre for Lifelong Learning will also benefit. In addition, the work I continue to do with the University of Oxford Access Initiative will allow me to bring my research to groups of A' level students through annual 'Humanities Study Days'. My research also promotes awareness and interest in the work of The National Archives, which provides a crucial means of access for the general public to a wide range of cultural resources. The 'Pathways to Impact' attachment outlines in detail the ways in which my project will benefit these groups. 


*How will they benefit from this research? 

To the public, this research will demonstrate the vitality of new scholarship in medieval history, and open up access to a wide range of textual and visual sources. More broadly, this sustains public interest in history and heritage, with visitors to museums and heritage sites providing vital revenue to this important sector of the UK economy.

For A' level students engagement with my research through presentations and study days will promote widening access to elite universities such as Oxford, and raise aspirations of students who might not otherwise consider applying to the top universities, in line with the government's emphasis on widening participation to students from all social backgrounds. If the government's vision is to be realised, it is vital that students have access to this wealth of material, particularly in subjects like medieval history which cannot always be covered in the state school curriculum.


* What will be done to ensure that they benefit from this research?

- Publication of a monograph and articles in magazines aimed at a broad public audience (BBC History Magazine and History Today) will disseminate my findings as widely as possible. 
- I will present papers for local history societies such as The Historical Association, and the Oxford Historical Society.
- I will continue my work with the Centre for Lifelong Learning, and the Centre for Continuing Education to ensure that the wider public have access to the most recent scholarly research.
- My work with schools and sixth-form colleges will encourage students to engage with medieval history, providing them with access to a broader range of historical subjects, and to the most recent developments in the academic field. 
- I will supply educational material on 'medieval subjects' to TNA, for their on-line 'virtual classroom', and a podcast for its A' level masterclass series.
- I will publicise my research in collaboration with scholars from a range of disciplines at a conference for the public held at TNA, projected for 2014.
This fellowship will provide me with a sabbatical over two terms of 2012, allowing me to schedule presentations with historical associations and prepare material for 'Humanities Study Days'.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-04-21</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>47837</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Durham University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Political Consciousness in the Pre-Modern World</gtr:description><gtr:id>D5E50C8A-8028-4F42-B7D3-A4125A68CADE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Workshop.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>543cf6851ae770.63202240-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Workshop with a view to applying for AHRC funding.
