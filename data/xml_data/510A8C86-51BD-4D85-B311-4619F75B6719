represents a major global issue. Significant improvements in crop yields are urgently required to meet the 50% increase in world population by 2050. The degree of root branching determines the efficiency of water uptake and acquisition of nutrients in crops. This research proposal aims to investigate the role of phosphite in improving root branching. 
There are several reports that suggest that Phosphites have biostimulant properties. We have tested the effects of phosphites in several crops and find about 30% increase in root growth. This project will investigate the mode of phosphite action and if improved root architecture result in improvement in yield. 
To help our studies, we have already identified several genes and signals that are important for this process. This includes two key plant hormones auxin and cytokinin and two proteins called BIG and ARF19. These genes and signals are known to regulate root development and root branching. For example, BIG is known to regulate auxin transport via regulating the activity of an auxin transport protein called PIN1. We will test if increased auxin accumulation mediated by BIG and PIN1 can be amplified via a special auxin inducible protein called ARF19 that regulate where root branches are formed. We also propose to manipulate level of a class of cytokinin called cis zeatin that show an induction in phosphite treated root tissues. We will manipulate endogenous cis zeatin levels by regulating cis zeatin biosynthesis or degradation. 
We will perform a series of experiments to test the role of these signals and proteins in regulating root branching. 
Next, we will undertake a series of physiological studies in two commercially important crops wheat and oilseed rape to determine whether phosphite treatment can improve resource use efficiency. The plants will be subjected to nutrient or water deficiency and its effect on above ground physiology assessed. We will also assess relationship between root system architecture and grain yield in the field. 
Finally we will investigate in which crops phosphites promote root growth. Our industrial partners will undertake a series of studies on biostimulant properties of phosphites in field trials. These partners will test several different phosphite formulations and their effect in a range of crops and in different agro climatic conditions. 
The knowledge gained from this study will provide information about the key genes and processes controlling root branching. Also by optimising doses, timing of application and treatments this project will provide a clear framework for phosphite treatment in a number of crops. With crops yielding better returns, this research is likely to have a direct impact on farm income leading to improved nutritional, financial and social stability.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Phosphite (Phi) has been reported to have biostiimulant properties. We have tested the effects of phi in several crops and find about 30% increase in root growth. This project will investigate the mode of phi action and if improved root architecture result in improvement in yield. 
Our expression profiling show an increase in a number of auxin related genes including BIG and ARF19. Auxin gradients are crucial for root development. BIG regulates auxin transport via regulating the activity of auxin transporter PIN1. We will test if increased auxin accumulation mediated by BIG and PIN1 can be amplified via auxin inducible transcription factor ARF19 that regulates root branching. Our hormone profiling studies show an increase in cis zeatin (cZ) type cytokinins. Cytokinins move from shoot to root and play a vital role during lateral root organogenesis by directing the flow of auxin into new LR primordia. This suggests a possible mode of action where foliar Phi application promotes cZ production in shoots, that is then transported to the root where it enhances downstream developmental processes such as LR initiation and/or emergence (either in/dependently of BIG and/or ARF19). We will use a combination of hormone profiling and functional approaches to test whether altered cZ levels are important for Phi-mediated root growth responses.
Next, we will undertake a series of physiological studies in wheat and oilseed rape to determine whether phi treatment can improve resource use efficiency. The plants will be subjected to nutrient or water deficiency and its effect on above ground physiology assessed. We will also assess relationship between root system architecture and grain yield in the field.

How will they benefit from this research?
Improved root architecture, is likely to have a direct impact in improving resource use efficiency and plant fitness in a number of commercially important horticultural and cereal crops. By having a clear framework for phosphite treatment in a number of crops, farmers are likely to be the direct beneficiaries of this research. With crops yielding better returns, this research is likely to have a direct impact on farm income leading to improved nutritional, financial and social stability. 
Our industrial partners have programs in place to engage with the farmers through information brochures, field visits and those will be the key channels that will be used to engage with the farmers and the wider community. In addition, University of Nottingham has a regular display at the UK Cereals event (http://www.cerealsevent.co.uk) attended by UK breeding and commercial seed sector. We will set up a mini-display with posters, video screen and practical demos.
Proposed research is important for Industrial Partner's to establish, beyond doubt, the biostimulant properties of phosphite and thus enable subsequent EU registration under biostimulant regulations. This award would also help establish a knowledge base that will allow Industrial partners to generate IP and new products with the information.
The project will generate a number of new data resources that will benefit a wide spectrum of researchers from other disciplines. Understanding of key signals/genes in regulating root traits will enable researchers to design new approaches to manipulate root branching in crops, forestry and horticultural varieties. Project results can also be exploited in other current grants and with industrial collaborators.
We plan to make the tools and resources publicly available as soon as possible, and by month 18 of the project. This will comply with BBSRC's desire that research results be fully available to the public and research community. Arabidopsis related materials will be made public through the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre that provides a convenient portal for other academics to obtain these resources (distributing 40,000 orders every year from a seed and DNA catalogue containing over 1,000,000 items). For wheat we will use BBSRC funded CerealsDB web site (funded until June 2018; http://www.cerealsdb.uk.net/). As such, our data will provide a key foundation for follow on projects. A range of dissemination mechanisms will be exploited. To the scientific community via presentations at international meetings, and other scientific conferences as well as publications in international refereed journals. The involvement of the commercial companies on the steering committee will also help to ensure that opportunities are not wasted in exploiting the project outcomes.
The project will also help train researchers experienced with working as part of a multidisciplinary team and enable them to engage with industry. This multidisciplinary expertise will uniquely position them for employment in the Agrochemical sector. 
The research will also benefit school age children. The Schools of Biosciences at Nottingham host an annual series of visits of children from local primary schools. The PDRA and technicians will engage in these events. This will be accompanied by a demonstration of how improved root architecture is crucial for plant growth and development - the key objective of the work. This will inspire students to consider science as a future career. We plan to prepare materials explaining plant-environment interactions and the project for these students.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-06-18</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-06-19</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>501798</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/P010520/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5B25B6A3-B218-4F11-8A9D-661236DF455C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agri-environmental science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>13975896-2E87-4DAA-99BC-E8D86B00B146</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Plant &amp; crop science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>C5107770-461D-42E3-B991-48AE97DF206F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Crop science</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>15080F45-1EA3-41B4-BC23-C49CB918FBC4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Plant physiology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AE2D53CC-F199-452E-A1FE-B63F4222D636</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Plant responses to environment</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
