The Dutch principal investigator, who has been studying baja ni performances since 1980, has collected many hours of recordings, and has recently prepared a manuscript text which, together with the recordings, will serve as the starting point for this project. Due to Islamization and Christianisation, traditional funerals are becoming rarer, and the transmission of the baja ni is in peril. The current jihadist troubles present an immediate and even violent threat to this heritage. 
The songs are attributed to a blind Dogon poet/prophet, Abir&amp;egrave;, probably from the 19th century, who also delivered a string of prophecies on the area. The aim of the project is first to widen the empirical knowledge on the prophetic song cycle, and to further analyse and contextualise the performances. Second, the recordings will be digitalized in such a way that they become accessible to the Dogon themselves, set in a digital framework which contextualizes the songs inside their material setting. Third, the goal is to initiate processes and institutions that may keep the heritage alive, independent of traditional funerals. 
Research activities on the ground will be done by Dogon researchers, guided by the consortium which is based in Leiden, London and Paris. Project partners in Mali are the National Museum in Bamako, the UNESCO office in Mali and Ginna Dogon, the association that represents the Dogon in cultural matters. 
Keywords: intangible heritage, Dogon, Mali, song, prophet</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The first potential impact is that Mali will solicit Unesco recognition of the Abir&amp;egrave; heritage as Immaterial World Cultural Heritage, a process which will be initiated at the start of the project. That demand in itself will take time, but also may serve as a catalyser for the various parties involved to combine forces. Any recognition granted will put a burden of responsibility on Mali, and this project may provide some of the means to shoulder that burden. However, the success of the project does not depend on the eventual recognition by Unesco. 
The final phase of the project is the implementation phase, that aims at creating a digital home for the preservation of the Abir&amp;egrave; heritage, with vistas for further study of text and performance within their material context, as well as a teaching-and-learning environment to keep this heritage alive. As far as digital technology is concerned, this project will be an exercise in simplicity, in quick accessibility and technological restrictions, a less-is-more approach. The major reason is that the mobile phone has to be central. The mobile phone is ubiquitous now in Africa, and already used by Africans in ways unforeseen by the North. It is impossible to devise a media approach to heritage in Africa without allotting the phone a central role, also because of the scanty access to the internet. . Online availability will be supplemented by and integrated with old school media: CD's with selections of baja ni songs, a DVD with the film and visual shots, plus a printed text of the baja ni in its various versions, all in Dogon Jamsay. A documentary film on Abir&amp;egrave; will also be made. The three principal researchers, will make a script for a documentary film on the life, times and songs of Abir&amp;egrave;. The film will be shot by the film institute in Mali. The consortium has ample experience with shooting documentary films in Mali, to supervise such a production of the film institute. 
These various media are meant to inspire intervillancounters of singers, regional workshops, and public performances in order to co-create the learning environment for prospective singers and performers. New platforms for baja ni performance might be generated, possibly in concord with the missionary religions that may well incorporate the baja ni in their mourning liturgies. Such a transmedia approach might well provide a suitable learning environment, not just to memorize and learn the texts and music of the baja ni songs as they stand, but to go one step further. After all, heritage of immaterial culture is neither repetition, nor simple preservation. What the project aims to preserve, in the end, is a living tradition, more than a fossilized one, and especially this kind of intangible heritage well suits itself for that goal. So, the aim is that not just this heritage is remembered and re-performed, but that it will be performed in such a way that the dynamics of performance are preserved as well. The ultimate goal is to transform the present living heritage into a new tradition that further develops, adapts and expands upon the old one, bringing the Abir&amp;egrave; heritage into the 21st century fully alive. 
So phase three, leading up to the desired impact, involves the following activities: 
- Assist in a demand by Mali for unesco recognition. 
- Combine digital sources and data into a content base to use for further digital use, while keeping the transmission of files as easy as possible. 
- Set up one or more host sites with a transparent structure to manage a large amount of related small files. 
- Making a documentary film on Abir&amp;egrave;. 
- Combine various types of media, both fully digital and more 'old school', into a learning environment. 
- Monitor the creation of a learning environment of this particular heritage, with safe keeping against domination of one of the parties.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>97560</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/S00114X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>020361E1-B8CA-49FD-9149-27D31D21C7A3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AD75E543-5F70-43C2-A40D-4452373465C4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Heritage Management</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>813866E9-8B0A-431C-A847-83DDED510CF0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Rel, Material &amp; Cog Anthrop</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
