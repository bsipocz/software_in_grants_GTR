Design, synthesis, characterisations and in vitro evaluation</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Fellowship</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/E042619/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Injectable scaffolds can offer the possibility of homogeneously distributing cells and molecular signals throughout the scaffold, and can be injected directly into cavities with irregular shape and size. Most studies have been on the development of injectable scaffolds for bone and cartilage tissue repair, some others for corneal wound healing. The most challenging issue is to find suitable materials which can solidify in situ to form 3-D scaffolds. Crosslinking via photopolymerisation provides many benefits, including rapid polymerisation times under physiological conditions. At present, most synthetic polymers used in tissue engineering are linear structure, however, they suffer from poor solution properties, non-homogenous crosslinking properties and limited control of polymer modification. Dendritic polymers have unique properties, such as good solubility, low viscosity and high functionality, due to their 3-D architecture. Grinstaff synthesised a photocrosslinkable dendrimer for corneal wound healing sealant and cartilage repair. However, dendrimers have to be prepared by solvent-intensive and multi-step synthetic routes, most importantly, it is difficult to tailor the composition and structure of dendrimers for a wide range of special applications. By contrast, hyperbranched polymers, less controlled dendritic polymer architectures, can be synthesised more easily by a single-step reaction via a range of synthetic strategies. Could the use of such hyperbranched polymers overcome the synthetic barrier of dendrimers? The limitation of current synthetic strategies for hyperbranched polymers are either the need of special monomers (ABn or AB* inimer), and/or, only poor controlled structure and low degree of branching polymers can be obtained. Therefore, up till now, such materials are difficult to be considered in medical applications. I have recognised that a breakthrough in synthesis of hyperbranched materials with controlled chain structure and high degree of branching using more accessible monomers could facilitate a completely new approach to their biological and biomedical applications.Recently, the Nottingham team has developed a deactivation enhanced ATRP method, which opens up the field significantly and allows simple use of readily available and inexpensive multifunctional vinyl monomers to synthesise hyperbranched polymers with high degree of branching, controlled molecular weight and chain structure. Such hyperbranched polymer materials could be extremely important for biological and biomedical applications. Furthermore, the products carry a multitude of reactive functionalities (e.g. double bonds and halogen functional groups) that can be post-functionalised and modified for specific applications by end capping with short chains, organic molecules and terminal grafting. By these modifications, the material properties, such as functionality, polarity, solubility and flexibility of the hyperbranched polymers, can be conveniently tailored to meet the application requirements. The polyvinyl functional groups can be used as corsslinking sites by photo stimuli to form 3-D structure. My aim is to design and synthesise a broad spectrum of tailored, novel hyperbranched polymers for biological and biomedical applications using the recently developed facile synthetic strategy, deactivation enhanced ATRP. This proposal targets the development of novel photocrosslinkable hyperbranched polymers as injectable scaffold materials for cartilage tissue repair. The hydrogels from the targeted hyperbranched polymers will achieve better biological response with tailored mechanical properties, integrin-mediated cell adhesion and control of growth factor release. The research will include three tasks with some subtasks as detailed in the Case of Support.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>256143</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>National University of Ireland, Galway (NUI)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Ireland, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Ireland</gtr:description><gtr:id>183E7EE0-39C1-46CD-ACA6-C3BB869584FB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This collaboration is multi-disciplinary between chemistry, material science and life science.

The use of injectable scaffolds can also minimise patient discomfort, risk of infection, scar formation, and the cost of treatment. The ultimate goal of my fellowship is to develop injectable scaffolds for tissue repair and wound healing. One of the challenging issues for the development of injectable scaffolds is to find suitable materials which can solidify in-situ to form 3-D scaffolds. Smart polymers which change in response to external stimuli such as temperature, pH and light have attracted much attention in terms of such applications. The objective of my proposed research project for this three-year EPSRC postdoctoral fellowship is to develop smart hyperbranched photocrosslinkable multifunctional biomaterials with tailored mechanical properties and functionalities for cell adhesion of specific cell types via decorating with peptide motifs as well as for controlled release of therapeutic protein drug/growth factors. These fine design and control will lead to novel injectable systems with a significant advance over current hydrogel systems. 

The proposed research project includes three main tasks with two stages. The first stage is to develop novel PEG based biocompatible and photocorsslinkable hyperbranched polymer systems using commercially available monomers. The research subtasks include monomer selection, synthesis and characterization of hyperbranched polymers as well as gel formation studies and evaluations on mechanical and biological properties of the gels. The methodologies established on polymer synthesis, characterization and property evaluations during the first stage are further used and developed in the second stage of the project on the development of biodegradable hyperbranched polymers using non-commercially available biodegradable branching agent (i.e. macromers) aiming to introduce biodegradable fragments into the targeted hyperbranched polymers. 

I have successfully developed thermal responsive and photocrosslinkable PEGMEMA-PPGMA-EGDMA hyperbranched polymers with potential applications for injectable scaffolds via deactivation enhanced atom transfer radical polymerisation (ATRP). I have also developed pH responsive poly (PAA-PEGDA) hyperbranched polymers with potential applications for drug delivery via reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerisation (RAFT). 

Thermoresponsive PEGMEMA-PPGMA-EGDMA hyperbranched copolymers developed have demonstrated the lower critical solution temperatures (LCST) ranging from 20 to 44 oC and with high levels of branching (30-50 mol %) and vinyl functionality (5-25 mol %). The photocrosslinking property of the materials has been investigated using UV lights and UV curing cell system attached to the Rheometer. I have successfully secured an award of the Partnership Programme in Science Research Visits fund from the British Council and Platform B?ta Techniek, which supported me to build up the collaborations with the Department of Pharmaceutics at Utrecht University in Netherlands and conduct real time photocrosslinking studies. Cytotoxicity assessments (Live/Dead staining and the Alamar Blue assay) for these hyperbranched copolymers using mouse C2C12 myoblast cell line and 3T3 fibroblast cell line confirmed their cytocompatibility in vitro. The studies have illustrated that hyperbranched copolymers PEGMEMA-PPGMA-EGDMA have great capacity to be developed for use as smart injectable materials in Regenerative Medicine such as wound healing and tissue repair. Further structure modifications, by introducing cell adhesion peptide moieties was investigated for the assessment on their ability to improve cell adhesion to these polymer gels.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>To further develop my independent research and academic career, with the permission from EPSRC and the consents from both the University of Nottingham and Bangor University, my fellowship was transferred to Bangor University in March 2009. Moving to a new institution is challenging and exciting because this allows me to conduct my research in a completely new academic environment, physically away from my former PHD and postdoctoral supervisors although the long-term constructive collaborations remain no changes. My mentors both from the University of Nottingham and the University of Washington have been giving me their full support and encouraging me to establish new collaborations internationally and locally in Wales. The newly developed collaborations include Utrecht University in Netherlands and National University of Ireland, Galway in Ireland. We have also successfully produced joint publications. The School of Chemistry at Bangor University is very supportive on my research and career development. I was assigned with the lab spaces and a DTA PhD studentship; I was also supported with the funding for the purchase of Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) equipment from Bangor University because GPC is the essential equipment for polymer synthesis studies.
