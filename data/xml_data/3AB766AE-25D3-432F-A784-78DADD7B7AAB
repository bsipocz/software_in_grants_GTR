Current practice is still biased towards measuring static and single dimensions of child poverty, primarily using monetary indicators as a proxy to capture other areas of deprivation. Cross-sectional research shows that assumptions about the extent to which poverty measures can serve as proxies for each other are often incorrect. As a result, policy is designed and targeted on the basis of incomplete information, leading to deficient identification of vulnerable children and an inadequate response to their needs.&lt;br />&lt;br />This research responds to these concerns by using monetary and non-monetary measures to analyse child poverty dynamics, assessing overlaps and mismatches between those measures and investigating reasons for potential differences using a combination of primary qualitative data and secondary panel survey data. It covers two case study countries, Ethiopia and Vietnam, and aims to influence academics, policy-makers and practitioners in developing and developed countries to contribute positively to the reduction of child poverty. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The most direct beneficiaries of this research include those who are directly involved in and contribute to this study. UK-based and local researchers will benefit by building their expertise and skills in this area of research. Such benefits are likely to have spill-over effects beyond these individuals and provide indirect benefits when knowledge and skills are transferred to fellow researchers.

Direct benefits of this research will also extend to the wider academic community. As indicated in the section on 'Academic beneficiaries', these include researchers working on issues of (child) poverty from across different disciplines and those working in a developing as well as developed country context. The new perspectives this research will offer in terms of measuring child poverty from a longitudinal perspective and the factors underlying child poverty dynamics will benefit the academic community working on issues of child poverty. Interest in this study is also likely to come from a broader research audience, including those working on child and social indicators at large and researchers employing mixed method research designs. The innovative aspects of this study in terms of constructing a longitudinal measure of poverty, pertaining to developing a measure that captures differential needs over time, as well as the use of mixed methods for its construction and analysis of concurrent outcomes will add value to this field of research.

Research benefits will also extend to the policy arena, with direct beneficiaries including those working on the reduction of child poverty. These include national governments of the countries directly involved in this study and developing countries at large. The results of this research may have far-reaching implications with respect to poverty reduction policies in both Viet Nam and Ethiopia, in terms of the groups of children being targeted and reached by policies, and the design and delivery of policy responses. This impact can be extended to other developing countries, particularly those with similar contexts in terms of the nature and magnitude of child poverty and demographic conditions. Research results may require a re-think of existing policies and general conceptions about which groups to target and with what kind of measures. Policy-makers in developed countries may equally benefit from this research, given the efforts to reduce child poverty in their own countries, and initiatives to do so globally as donors or development partners. Although the context of child poverty and its dynamics will be different, we know from previous cross-sectional research that mismatches across monetary and multidimensional measures of (child) poverty also hold in developed countries (Roelen &amp;amp; Notten, 2011; Bradshaw &amp;amp; Finch, 2003) and that conceptual and methodological concerns with respect to the improvement of child poverty measurement are similar.

International organisations as well as national and international NGOs and civil society organisations will also benefit directly from this study. The research results will provide them with tools to advocate on child poverty issues and to lobby for resources towards comprehensive child poverty measurement, monitoring of child rights and addressing the underlying and structural causes of child poverty. Such organisations include, but are not limited to, Save the Children, EveryChild, ActionAid and UNICEF.

Although indirect, the most important beneficiaries of this research will be poor children and their families. The overall objective of this research is to contribute to the reduction of child poverty, thereby improving the living conditions and livelihood prospects for children living in poverty. The improvement of poverty reduction policies and initiatives, pertaining to both the groups targeted and covered and the shape of the policy response, will positively affect the lives of those at the heart of this research.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>173972</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The illustration aims to depict research findings in an engaging manner, appealing to both children and adults that were included in the research and for a wider audience.</gtr:description><gtr:id>94A877F6-7B12-4C66-AB64-E668CEB96F15</gtr:id><gtr:impact>It proved helpful in disseminating research results to the research participants and local government and stimulate discussion about such findings, particularly the differences between monetary and non-monetary poverty.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dd68e7c077e3.17612222</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Reducing Poverty in the First 18 Years of Life: Vietnam</gtr:title><gtr:type>Image</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://opendocs.ids.ac.uk/opendocs/bitstream/handle/123456789/6929/Vietnam%20research%20brief-%20reducing%20poverty%20in%20the%20first%2018%20years%20of%20life_aug15_ILLUSTRATION.pdf?sequence=1</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The illustration aims to depict research findings in an engaging manner, appealing to an audience of policy makers, practitioners and wider public.</gtr:description><gtr:id>756FD8DF-F99C-4A08-B6DA-9C7707431BA1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>It proved helpful in disseminating research results to government representatives and international and national NGOs and stimulate discussion about such findings, particularly differences between income and other areas of child wellbeing and the trade-off between child wellbeing and work.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dd695def7eb0.47877022</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Reducing poverty in the first 18 years of life: Burundi</gtr:title><gtr:type>Image</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.ids.ac.uk/publication/reducing-poverty-in-the-first-18-years-of-life-burundi</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The illustration aims to depict research findings in an engaging manner, appealing to both children and adults that were included in the research and for a wider audience.</gtr:description><gtr:id>1B8C1E58-3868-4383-9B70-8A222546A230</gtr:id><gtr:impact>It proved helpful in disseminating research results to the research participants and stimulate discussion about such findings, particularly the trade-off between child wellbeing and work.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dd689c430ed3.44313840</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Reducing Poverty in the First 18 Years of Life: Ethiopia</gtr:title><gtr:type>Image</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://opendocs.ids.ac.uk/opendocs/bitstream/handle/123456789/6927/Ethiopia%20research%20brief-%20reducing%20poverty%20in%20the%20first%2018%20years%20of%20life_aug15_ILLUSTRATION.pdf?sequence=1</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Global Child Poverty Coalition</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Global Child Poverty Coalition</gtr:description><gtr:id>25B7FADD-B021-45F3-B468-1D7647DD895F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The coalition has produced a brief to propose indicators for measuring child poverty in the SDGs, primarily aiming to influence the implementation of SDGs post-2015.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>55f835a4c7e9d3.45001443-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The Global Child Poverty Coalition is convened by UNICEF and Save the Children and is still in the process of establishing membership and strategy.

In the discussion following the presentation of findings, some participants indicated that they had not thought about multidimensional poverty being different from monetary poverty but that they now see how these are two different issues. Most participants received the information and expressed appreciation for the feedback of research findings.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>560aeee44ac550.17396819</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Participants in your research and patient groups</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Book launch 'Mixed Methods Research in Poverty and Vulnerability'</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4E199128-4754-4F04-AB93-8878CADBBF52</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This book launch included presentations by three contributors to the edited volume followed by a plenary Q&amp;amp;A and discussion regarding the role of mixed methods research.

This was hosted by the Impact Initiative at IDS in collaboration with the Global Coalition to End Child Poverty. The Coalition, chaired by Save the Children and UNICEF, include other members from INGOs, think tanks and academics (www.endchildhoodpoverty.org). This research day brought together 42 people and provided an opportunity for practitioners, researchers, and leading experts to come together to collectively discuss the issue of child poverty. Of those in attendance, there were four ESRC/DFID Joint Fund for Poverty Alleviation Research and two grantees from the Raising Learning Outcomes in Education Systems Research Programme, seven IDS researchers/members of staff, 11 students and 16 Coalition members, a Scribe who documented the day, and a photographer. The event reached approximately 40-50 non-participants from policy and practice through social media. 

The objective of the research day/learning event was to discuss research that is and has been done on child poverty, and how this might be more directly linked to, or inform, policy. The main structure of the day - discussing monetary poverty and multidimensional poverty for children separately - follows directly from the findings of my research. The discrepancy between monetary and multidimensional child poverty was a recurrent theme throughout the day with presenters and discussants highlighting the need to look beyond income in households and also the need to look at the situation of individual children as opposed to that of the family as a whole.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b6c1987cf647.27482381</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.theimpactinitiative.net/blog/blog-child-poverty-research-day</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Interview with New Zealand radio station Newstalk ZB on child poverty.</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5F728A32-FC31-4CD9-9873-167E325F9F32</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The interview followed a comment by New Zealand's Prime Minister in response to rising child poverty figures in New Zealand, saying that new and alternative solutions for the problem from other contexts are to be considered.

The presentation formed input into a wider discussion about the need for complementary poverty measurement for children as the research findings clearly show that different poverty measures provide different pictures of poverty.

The presentation in conjunction with other presentations and subsequent discussion resulted in the Director for Poverty Reduction from MOLISA confirming that child poverty requires separate measurement using both monetary and multidimensional measures. He also expressed ideas for how UNICEF and government should take this forward so that measures are institutionalised and used for national poverty measurement.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>560aeb6c909ab8.46541214</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/parliamentarians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation at the conference 'Graduation and Social Protection' in Kigali, Rwanda: 'Children: the key to graduation'.</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4CDC6EBA-8AB4-42B6-8B5B-870A913C1199</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The presentation raised discussion about the role of children in livelihoods programmes and how they may be negatively affected due to their role in income generation.

The wealth of experiences with existing methods have also laid the foundation for more innovative approaches in integrating quantitative and qualitative research and frank discussion of its challenges. 

The purpose of this workshop was to share ideas and experiences, learn lessons from past and on-going work and discuss work-in-progress using mixed methods research in the field of poverty and vulnerability. Its informal format enabled discussion in more detail and with more depth than is possible in other events on poverty and vulnerability. The workshop focused on three different themes and mixed-methods research within those themes: 1) poverty measurement, 2) poverty dynamics, and 3) impact evaluation.

Research as part of this grant provided the backdrop against which this workshop was organised.

This workshop has led to a formal offer by Palgrave MacMillan to publish an eponymous edited volume based on outcomes from this workshop, forthcoming in 2015.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-644010808.91863512b4222b2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:presentationType>workshop facilitator</gtr:presentationType><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.uea.ac.uk/international-development/news-and-events/-/asset_publisher/l3gJjn9gE7wm/blog/call-for-papers-uea-ids-international-workshop-on-mixed-methods-research-in-poverty-and-vulnerability-sharing-ideas-and-learning-lessons-uea-london;</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013,2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Contribution to World Bank consultation 'Striking Poverty'</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>90941F37-892F-4247-95A3-DEE768DAE0D3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This contribution fed into the World Bank's open online consultation on measuring extreme poverty that was held from 28 September to 30 November 2015 and led by Sir Anthony Atkinson and Kaushik Basu.

Academic impact of this research is evidenced in a number of ways. Firstly, the acceptance of presentations on this topic at multiple conferences and workshops from across a range of disciplines since its inception are testament to the wide intellectual relevance and pertinence of the topic. The research has been represented at conferences on development studies, human development and capabilities research, child indicators research, and longitudinal social science research, but also academic workshops focusing on mixed methods research. Secondly, outputs that have already been published (including policy briefs and an edited volume) are being purchased/downloaded and cited in academic outputs. Download statistics indicate that the main output of this research so far - the brief 'Reducing all Forms of Child Poverty: The Need for Comprehensive Measurement' has been downloaded more than 750 times. Finally, the academic impact of will be extended soon with an accepted publication in Development and Change (1.72) and a second article under review with the European Journal for Development Research (0.720).

Policy impact has been established through collaboration with existing and new partnerships as created as part of or during the project period. These include the relationship with Concern Worldwide in Burundi and the complementary use of this research to a mixed methods evaluation of their Graduation Programme. As a result of this collaboration, findings were disseminated at a national event with representatives from key line ministries, international partners including World Bank and UNICEF and national NGOs. The policy outputs were downloaded roughly 2,500 times. The research findings from Ethiopia and Vietnam were discussed and disseminated at local and district level with policy makers from across social sectors, and were also presented at national level throughout the project period. Policy outputs for each country have been downloaded more than 800 times. Feedback from these sessions suggest that they helped to create awareness about the many predicaments that children suffer and the inability of monetary poverty measures to capture these deprivations adequately or to appropriately guide policy responses to all forms of child poverty.

Policy impact at a global level has been achieved and will continue to be expanded through ongoing collaboration with UNICEF, Save the Children and the Global Coalition to End Child Poverty. Seminars at both UNICEF and Save the Children have helped to inform thinking about how to frame child poverty and wellbeing. Continuous engagement with Save the Children has led to their recommendations for reducing global child poverty specifically mentioning the need for measuring both monetary and multidimensional child poverty. The Coalition is led by UNICEF and Save the Children and brings together international NGOs and research institutes aiming to reduce all forms of child poverty. Research findings have been vital in shaping in debates around what forms of child poverty to focus on, the Coalition's response to the SDGs and the forthcoming guidance on child poverty to be published by UNICEF on behalf of the Global Coalition to End Child Poverty. Research findings are also guiding a forthcoming research day on child poverty in November 2016 in preparation of a large global 'research to policy' conference in 2017 that seeks to bring together researchers, policy makers and NGOs from across the globe and will focus particularly on how research can contribute to meaningful policy.

Impact on future leaders has been achieved throughout that project period by teaching in the MA programmes at IDS, reaching a total of more than 150 students. Course evaluations indicate that students learned about the importance of poverty measurement for appropriately identifying children (and others) in need and shaping appropriate policies, and also about the importance of mixed methods research. Impact will continue to evolve through continuous teaching in graduate programmes. In addition, research findings will soon be published as part of a chapter authored for the handbook 'An Introduction to International Development', published by Oxford University Press. The book is targeted at BA students and sales from the previous two versions total approximately 25,000 units. 

Finally, research findings can also be considered through tis impact on the general public. A range of media outlets were used for achieving impact, including blog posts, Twitter, an interview on New Zealand's Newstalk ZB radio station in March 2015 and a commentary in the Guardian in July 2015. The commentary in the Guardian was shared more than 500 times on social media; it was quoted in another Guardian commentary on 19 July; and tweets by the Guardian and IDS and re-tweets by organisations operating in UK and developing countries reached over 4 million people from general public and more than 200,000 people interested in development studies or child poverty in both developed or developing country contexts.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>6B338DFD-954F-4C2C-AAAF-474A95A2DF26</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56dd66f1f0e524.55042475</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Achievements

(1) Research findings expand the evidence base by firmly establishing that monetary and multidimensional child poverty are different phenomena and for offering explanations underpinning poverty mismatch. While measurement error offers a partial explanation, structural factors in the public and private spheres play a more important role. These include characteristics of the household and household head; awareness, attitudes and aspirations; availability of social services and access to social policies; and wider cultural norms and tradition. This project also contributes to the discourse on mixed methods approaches through its attempts to overcome methodological challenges in combining secondary quantitative and primary qualitative data.
 
 (2) This research engaged with a range of academic disciplines including development studies, social policy, longitudinal studies and childhood studies as well as with methodological debates underpinning such disciplines, relevant to low, middle and high-income country contexts. This was achieved through presentations at academic conferences and seminars, including the organisation of an international workshop culminating in a co-edited book, presentations at international conferences as well as small-scale seminars targeted at academic staff and students. The appeal to this unique combination of audiences enabled the research to inform and be informed by different disciplinary debates and offer perspectives on various issues related to the measurement and reduction of child poverty and wellbeing, both in the countries included in the study and beyond.

(3) This research established linkages between various policy areas aiming to improve the lives of children, including child poverty, economic strengthening, social protection and child protection. This was achieved by creating synergies with other research and policy advice projects and building on existing relationships. Concern Worldwide was involved in data collection and dissemination in Burundi, UNICEF was involved in national-level dissemination and policy engagement in Vietnam while collaboration with Save the Children included an internal presentation of findings to their staff. Other linkages led to the inclusion of research findings within wider debates about economic strengthening and social protection, such as with the USAID-funded ASPIRES project, Fonkoze and UNICEF CEE/CIS region.

(4) This project included local research teams in Burundi, Ethiopia and Vietnam in the process of data collection and analysis, building their skills in doing research with children generally and using participatory methods. Junior researchers based in the UK were hired as research assistance gained skills and expertise in analysing complex qualitative data.

Challenges

(1) This particular call had a focus on analysing existing sets of secondary data. Despite the growing availability of such datasets, access to data is difficult and sometimes costly to obtain, throwing up barriers in tightly timed research project.

(2) Capacity constraints of local partners with respect to doing research with children in terms of ethical and practical considerations posed a challenge to the depth of information to be obtained.

(3) Country-specific developments in policy dialogue in countries of study and the time-bound nature of this study challenged opportunities for linking this research into ongoing policy processes.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>National policy impact in countries included in study: Country-specific policy briefs and illustrations summarising findings and providing recommendations allow for further engagement with policy-makers and practitioners with the aim to integrate findings in policy development with respect to measurement of multidimensional and child poverty (Ethiopia and Vietnam) and economic strengthening (Burundi). While direct dissemination has already taken place, findings may inform future collaborations with notably UNICEF and Concern Worldwide and government counterparts through new and strengthened relationships in all three countries. Collaboration is likely to move ahead in all three countries. Local research partners will also be able to take this research further in their future work.

National and international impact elsewhere: Research findings have been summarised in overall policy briefs and illustrations, allowing for more general dissemination and policy engagement. Existing bilateral relationships and collaborations with INGOs and NGOs such as UNICEF, Save the Children and Family for Every Child and wider networks such as the Global Coalition for Ending Child Poverty will be used as channels for creating policy impact at national and international level through face-to-face and virtual presentations, contributions to organisational strategies and joint publications.

Academia: The project has led to academic publications (published and under review) that allow for findings to be fed into academic research and debate on poverty measurement, childhood studies, social policy and mixed method approaches. Future dissemination activities such as public launches, conference presentations, targeted seminars and social media engagement should ensure take up of findings. Findings can also be integrated in future research proposals.

Students: The integration of findings in a chapter in a handbook on development studies and inclusion of materials from this research in teaching of MA students at IDS will ensure that the findings will be taken forward into next generation of development practitioners.

Wider public: Ongoing media engagement with newspapers, online magazines and social media will allow for wide dissemination of the work.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>CDE37700-F6BF-4670-BDBD-494DAE458226</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5677d4c24f8398.65775380</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www.ids.ac.uk/project/future-research-leaders-reducing-poverty-in-the-first-18-years-of-life</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Training on qualitative research on child wellbeing in Vietnam.</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Asia</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>69AFE40F-1B7A-4686-8498-A05DAB8E88AD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The training focused on capacity building of four local researchers regarding qualitative research with children.
