Proteins can be fluorescently labelled with high specificity and this permits one to study where and when they are produced or degraded within living cells with high spatial and temporal resolution. The fluorescence signatures may also report on subtle changes in the molecular environment of the tagged proteins. For example interactions between proteins may lead to subtle intensity, colour and lifetime changes in the emission of the reporting fluorophores. There is therefore a constant demand in the life sciences for novel, better, and more flexible instrumentation to measure fluorescence from within living cells. The fluorescence lifetime in particular is a key parameter in such efforts. Molecular proximity can quench fluorescence and this in turn results in a reduction of the lifetime. Measuring lifetime from molecules in cells is however a difficult task: There is always a trade-off between the precision and the speed at which a lifetime measurement can be performed. In the current proposal we seek to improve on a technique called frequency domain lifetime imaging microscopy (FD FLIM): This technique is popular in conjunction with widefield fluorescence microscopy because it is simple and flexible in application but it has drawbacks, because in its conventional form, the speed of measurement and the precision are limited. In the present work we aim to overcome these limitations and vastly improve on the capability of FD FLIM for measurements of protein-protein interactions in living systems. The instrument to be developed here will be used in the study of the molecular processes, which regulate cell division and we will be able to do this in much more detail than before: The features we study are highly dynamic and occur over small spatial scales and the improved temporal resolution and precision will quantify events that we have not been able to observe so far. The capability we are developing here will be available for researchers from various departments and be useful in situations where either molecular scale events need to be monitored at rapid speed, such as signalling events in cells, or in situations where high measurement precision is required, for example to record subtle lifetime changes that may report on different oligomeric states of aggregating monomers.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>With the current proposal we seek funds to develop a novel and versatile Frequency Domain Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscope (FD FLIM) which is flexible to operate at 1) high measurement speed by a method we term phi2FLIM, or, 2) at a precision hitherto difficult to achieve with available FD FLIM instrumentation in a variant of FD FLIM we term mh-FLIM (multi harmonic FLIM). The technology we propose is motivated by our wish to promote research on the role of key mitotic regulators during cell division. It represents a substantial improvement over existing technologies and, although specifically applied to mitosis research, will find widespread applications for biophysical studies of molecular function in living cells. Beneficiaries will include life scientists who may already have FD FLIM instrumentation available in their laboratories: The proposed technologies are relatively straight forward to implement on current, commercially available FD FLIM systems. The ideas behind the proposed research arose from ongoing collaborations between the groups of Dr. Clemens Kaminski at the department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology and Dr. Catherine Lindon at the department of Genetics at the University of Cambridge. We have conducted extensive feasibility studies to assess the feasibility of the proposed tools and methods and the current grant would permit us to: 1) set up a fully functioning microscopy unit which permits, at user's choice and essentially 'at the flick of a switch', either mh FLIM or phi2FLIM to be performed, 2) Validate and calibrate the developed techniques, 3) demonstrate the use of the instrumentation to generate insights into the ubiquitination of substrates in living cells. If successful, this will generate preliminary results to pump prime a larger scale research programme for which separate funding will be sought.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research will develop a capability to perform frequency domain fluorescence lifetime microscopy 1) at rapid speed without the problem of frequency aliasing and 2) at high accuracy, with the capability to resolve multiple lifetime components from a sample. Who will benefit from this research (see also academic beneficiaries section above)? The tools to be developed will help the UK maintain its leading role in applied photonics research. There is great commercialisation potential (see attached letter of support from Fianium). European manufacturers of diagnostic equipment are likely to incorporate the proposed technology into future platforms for example for drug screening. This idea is currently being explored with Astra Zeneca and the technology transfer office in Cambridge to develop a screening platform for anti aggregation drugs against neurodegenerative disease. The general potential to generate impact for the economic sector is maximised through the PI's role as director of CamBridgeSens (http://sensors.cam.ac.uk) which facilitates liaison with, and technology diffusion to, leading manufacturers of biomedical equipment. The technology proposed is enabled through the use of supercontinuum radiation generated in Photonic Crystal Fibres, an invention that originates from the UK. The leading manufacturer of supercontinuum products (Fianium Ltd, southampton) is also situated in the UK and collaborates with us, ensuring a rapid translation of concepts to products which are of general value to the community. The research will enable the study of dynamic molecular interactions in living systems and initially be used for fundamental research related to cancer and protein aggregation disease. Outcomes from such research will increase fundamental knowledge that in the longer term may lead to novel treatments of disease.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-10-17</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-10-18</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>119764</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Hutchison/MRC Research Centre</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>BRCA2 dynamics experiment in cancer research with Prof. Ashok Venkitaraman</gtr:description><gtr:id>5B922F2E-5904-47AD-A09B-1293CF1B83BF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This collaboration has led to the following publication:

We have demonstrated and used these capabilities through application in live cell mitosis research. The system was developed through modification of an existing wide-field FD FLIM system and makes use of a pulsed supercontinuum light source for excitation and permits arbitrary phase profiles to be imposed on the gain waveform of the image collection system. In one mode of operation, which we term multiharmonic FLIM (mh FLIM), information can be retrieved from multiple harmonics present in the signal waveform. This permits multiple lifetimes to be resolved in every pixel. In another mode of operation, which we term phi2FLIM, the system will be capable of recording fluorescence lifetime images at several Hz repetition rates. phi2FLIM removes all components from higher harmonic frequencies from the signal and thus completely eliminates frequency aliasing artefacts in FD FLIM. We have applied mh FLIM for the study of the CFP-Plk1/YFP-ubiquitin pair in fixed cells to characterize mitosis-specific FRET between the substrate and ubiquitin. We have furthermore performed dynamic live cells studies using phi2FLIM to establish when and where ubiquitination of Plk1 occurs, and to determine the fate of ubiquitinated Plk1 complexes. This provides us with novel insights into how ubiquitination of Plk1 contributes to its activity, and to the organization of mitosis.

The microscope developed in this project is now supporting an PhD project supported by industry. Our industrial partners (MedImmune) are supporting the development of an image texture analysis technique that incorporates fluorescence lifetime data as well as spectrally-resolved image data, in order to determine whether solid pharmaceutical samples are genuine products or counterfeit.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The platforms developed can be used for drug screening applications and biomedical diagnostics. Development of hardware:

1) A prototype instrument incorporating mhFLIM and phi2FLIM with a supercontinuum excitation source and fast gated intensifier has been built. An optimised version of the instrument will be made available in the Cambridge Advanced Imaging Center (CAIC), a multiuser imaging facility to serve the life science research community. Software for mhFLIM and phi2FLIM methods has been developed and is available free of charge from our web page.

2) A new tool for quantitative analysis of ubiquitination, in vivo-biotinylatable ubiquitin, was developed that outperforms current assays for endogenous ubiquitin in human cells. The method permits the timing and location of ubiquitination of specific mitotic substrates. 



We have collaborated with Fianium UK and could show that their supercontinuum technology is ideally matched for high fidelity frequency domain FLIM applications, that are both fast and possess a high photon economy. This opens new commercial opportunities for supercontinuum light sources. We have collaborated with LaVision to obtain a custom made intensifier unit that is optimised for mhFLIM and phi2FLIM applications. We have also been collaborating with Lambert Instruments (Netherlands) on the implementation of mhFLIM on their commercial frequency domain FLIM platforms . 



The developed widefield techniques are faster and more precise than current techniques and, although this was unanticipated at the time of writing this grant, they are proving useful also in the study of protein aggregation phenomena in live cells and small organism models of Alzheimer's disease



We have participated in the Cambridge Science Festival to educate the broader public on the use of advanced microscopic imaging in medical research. The PI has also given a public lecture organised by the Kelvin Club in Cambridge on the history and use of microscopy.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>DFFF8F78-D2BD-4DEA-8999-80773DA130BC</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-5111170546.25523477724248</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://laser.ceb.cam.ac.uk</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D0984741-8A94-49DD-9109-933979777E40</gtr:id><gtr:title>Design and application of a confocal microscope for spectrally resolved anisotropy imaging.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Optics express</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4f542cf3e85d9fc356dcf95ba1bac77f"><gtr:id>4f542cf3e85d9fc356dcf95ba1bac77f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Esposito A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1094-4087</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d07f07f451fa74</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>67A89C76-64C3-4FEF-ABA9-1E8F44BF3B10</gtr:id><gtr:title>HomoFRET fluorescence anisotropy imaging as a tool to study molecular self-assembly in live cells.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Chemphyschem : a European journal of chemical physics and physical chemistry</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/00ddf4fbc16ad82ee40ebfdac6e70518"><gtr:id>00ddf4fbc16ad82ee40ebfdac6e70518</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Chan FT</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1439-4235</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_55f9859854f19439</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4FA89A15-9209-486C-AED1-67A94DBC9760</gtr:id><gtr:title>A cancer-associated BRCA2 mutation reveals masked nuclear export signals controlling localization.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nature structural &amp; molecular biology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e0f8965e8e8465c924c0a035380d968b"><gtr:id>e0f8965e8e8465c924c0a035380d968b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Jeyasekharan AD</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1545-9985</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5457b36240ac59.14060747</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/H023917/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
