Activity 2: The KE Fellow/s will strengthen their understanding of existing BBSRC/NERC collaborative programmes e.g. HAPI, GFS-SARISA &amp;amp; SARIC and related NERC programmes e.g. 'Soil Security' initiative and other funding e.g. KTPs, Agri-Tech Catalyst etc. These initiatives will be mapped to BBSRC/NERC collaborative programmes to add value and up-scale benefits/impacts.

Activity 3: The KE Fellow/s in consultation with the HAPI Steering Group and Horticulture Innovation Partnership (HIP) will identify potential collaboration opportunities between industry and the research community. These will be encouraged at Bi-annual 'Sandpit' events; Follow-up meetings for the development of high quality, innovative projects.

Activity 4: Identification of agri-business, levy board, trade association and retailer KE pathways and their optimization. Embedding of outputs from HAPI will be achieved through these KE pathways and submission of articles to professional practice journals. EMR has agreement that any outputs can be publicised in the HDC news magazine and weekly HDC e-news. Arrangements will be made for outputs from HAPI to be presented at key industry events.Research outputs will be packaged in a form appropriate and accessible to HAPI/relevant industry, their supply chains, and, where appropriate, to the wider business community through; working with relevant communication groups &amp;amp; researchers to help researchers to break down their work into key messages; providing researchers with industry target areas of interest on which to hook ideas. The Head of Communications at EMR has agreed to provide additional advice in this area (previously CEH Communications Manager). Dr Jay has also taught on the BBSRC communication and PR courses. Research outputs will be translated into business decision support tools that directly benefit business performance, risk strategy and environmental management through; computer-based information systems providing critical data to help make more effective business decisions, e.g. predictive analysis, data mining/integration/modelling.

Activity 5: Analysis of the knowledge gaps identified in the Horticultural Development Company (HDC) funded project 'A gap analysis of soil management research and knowledge transfer in horticulture to inform future research programmes' and 'Gap analysis on the future requirements of soil and water management in England' for the Royal Agricultural Society of England (RASE) will form the basis for the identification of industry knowledge gaps and prioritization of research opportunities. 

Activity 6: Key NERC/BBSRC research base as well as pertinent industry contacts [focus on fresh produce] will be invited to constitute a working group (WG). It is envisaged that this will be established 6-months after project outset. Thereafter the WG will meet quarterly. 

Activity 7: The KE Fellow/s will report to the HAPI Steering Group as stipulated in project brief. Further, through acquiring an in depth understanding of knowledge gaps &amp;amp; research priorities the KE Fellow/s will be able to participate in future investment planning &amp;amp; scoping of funding calls. Based on information gathered under Activity 1-5 a report will be delivered by Dec. 2015 that exposes the knowledge gaps, research translation opportunities and barriers, priorities, and the capability of the research base to develop high quality BBSRC/NERC interface</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-06-04</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-05</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>223937</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>British Carrot Demo Day and trade exhibition, West Knapton, North Yorkshire, 6th October</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>86FCFB45-536A-4D3D-839B-DB943A073A8E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As a result of providing a demonstration and discussion at the British Herb Event I was invited to provide a demonstration that would engage carrot growers in a discussion about soil health. The event was well attended by growers and equipment specialists. Also present were representatives from AHDB, Environment Agency and scientist involved with trials on the field site.

There was no formal timetable for group discussions, people were allowed to wonder the site and stop off as and where they liked. Some times you would be talking to one or two people and at other times there would be a group of up to ten people. With just a soil pit and simple penetrometers that people were encouraged to try, it was possible to engage people in a wide variety of conversation about soil health ranging from soil structure and its influence on drainage and water retention, soil organic matter content, disease control and weed control. It was also possible to link the discussions about soil health to product quantity and quality and to tie it in with some of the variety trials they had seen on the site. With some of the visitors it was also possible to talk about their involvement with trials and the factors that were most likely to contribute to them trying something new. Trust related to proof of concept was high on most peoples responses.

An interesting observation about this event was that people seemed more willing to stop and chat at the side of a soil pit than they were at a poster/banner. Having met Martin Wood at the Herb Event, Martin was trying to engage the industry in knowledge exchange (KE) under the AHDB Great Soils project, we had already agreed to help each other out at this event. Martin found that people at this event did not seem to stop at his stand in the marquee but when he came out and stood by the soil pit and could discuss his KE tools as part of the general conversation he was more successful in getting people to sign up to his programme.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c908a6ea00a0.21165496</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Appetite for Growth, South East Midlands Local Enterprise Partnership (Colworth)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1A797CD0-8EFC-4A82-AC7C-19B422D2033A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>An event that enabled me to discuss opportunities for industry and scientists to work more effectively together.

October 2016 News Letter
In the October news release we provided a brief summary of the results of our survey that I had undertaken with industry and science representatives from the horticulture and potato sector. The article gave a link to the full report document hosted on the HIP web page (see http://www.hip.org.uk/hip-activity/current/thank-you-for-giving-20-minutes-of-your-time-to-benefit-your-industry).

We also contributed a second article based around the 'Making an Impression' blog, which gave the link to our blog page where this blog is hosted.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c962ad4342c3.96135168</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Garden Press event (London)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4274DB1D-1723-4394-B19B-06F7108E88E5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Used this event to publicise the release of the HIP Ornamental and Landscape Horticulture strategy document. The stand enabled us to engage with a variety of people and to not only discuss the HIP Ornamental strategy document but also enabled us to discuss the wider Fellowship and to get peoples opinions as to their perspective of the value of scientific research to them. 

We also used this event to highlight opportunities for businesses to engage with science and potential grants they may benefit from in so doing. A lot of the smaller businesses said they had never considered enquiring in to what their local university may be able to do to benefit them. Most said they would look into it but it is as yet uncertain as to whether they will or not.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cc7951421294.78976719</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>British Herb Trade Association (BHTA) Field Event, Frilford, 25th August</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A038E39D-4A4B-403D-9A7A-8F1F00A225BC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited with a colleague to give a field talk entitled Soil in Horticulture. Discussed soil health and the use of cover crops and mulches in order to prevent erosion and to maintain crop quality. A big issue for herb produces is soil splash onto the product, which reduces the value of the product. We used an in-field demonstration to show how mulches and therefore cover crops could be used to reduce splash erosion. This would have value from a soil health perspective and also prevent wastage and loss of product value.

This even also offered an opportunity to engage the audience in conversation about preferences for knowledge exchange. The majority of the audience agreed that they got greatest confidence out of seeing something demonstrated in a field trial. They were keen to hear from scientists and got most benefit from when the science could be demonstrated to them and where they could ask questions.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c832f512cf79.98267856</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>HLH Vegetable Conference, Lincolnshire, 21st February</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F0E4A3FB-837A-4163-9849-E2F0DD4C4CD3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited to give a talk about 'Soil Management in Vegetable Production'. However, also mentioned as part of the presentation opportunities of how to get more involved with science in order that the type of research is not only relevant to them but also that the information is fed back to their community. Most of the audience were agronomists or advisers who had responsibility for a number of farms in an area. They were therefore able to feedback information to a much wider audience than was present on the day. They could also raise issues/concerns on behalf of the farmers that they advised.

The horticultural industry have a conference season that runs from about October until March. During this time there are a number of events at which research is discussed and there is potential for a much wider section of the scientific community to tap into these events.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c93170074d44.96547429</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>G's Onion Growers Field Day, Sulfolk, 12 August</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5EB5DB60-D3DF-4E87-9ACE-94EC4C85FC8E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>invited to give an infield talk to approximately 40 farmers on soil health and in particular capping and soil erosion issues in onions. Although this also extended into water management and cover crops as well.

The talk stimulated a good range of questions. However, the most important take home message from this day, for me, was the issue of people trying something once and if it failed being reluctant to try it again. This has implications for the transfer of scientific information. While people probably do not like to hear or choose to ignore when we say that 'the research was limited' and therefore the benefits of using it in other circumstances may be lower. Sometimes people get swept along by a trend without fully understanding why they are doing something or what the limitations of the method are. In part this can be mitigated by full scale field demonstrations, which help to demonstrate that something is 'fit for purpose' in the real world. But the importance of highlighting the limitations of our knowledge is very important if we are not to put off the less adventurous participants. We need to explore new ways of improving the confidence we have and can therefore give to the end user. This may well involve using citizon science in the future to beta test an idea over a wider variety of circumstances before wider release.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c82bc66c75f2.86650628</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>PW potato growers day</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D2921A86-DB0E-4D86-9D43-37239E9DF297</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The intention was to engage different sectors of the food chain and get their opinion as to how they felt science had worked for them and what they felt they needed from science in the future. Also I wanted to get a better idea of the main drivers that influenced their decision making. The event brought together growers, packers and sales personnel. I was able to highlight the on-line questionnaire and although I do not believe many of the people I talked to filled it in I did managed to get their opinions on the day.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cc744d275bd2.72174332</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>BASF Farm trial event, Ilminster, 22nd June</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3009B622-74A5-4D95-B345-1F0B60D6E2E6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited to give an in-field talk on 'Best practise with tyres to protect soil'. The event was set-up so that different groups of between 5 to 20 visited throughout the day. I built the discussion around the impact of soil compaction on infiltration, water retention and productivity. But there was also time to open up the discussion to explore how useful the participants found this type of activity in relation to trying out new ideas. At times I also discussed issues that the audience had when it came to knowledge exchange.

The main impact of the day was:
1) Several of the audience agreed to dig inspection holes in there field to check whether they had compaction or not before subsoiling and to also use inspection holes to check on the effectiveness of subsoiling. If they do this then soil health will be improved. 
2) Others agreed to consider using cover crops as bioengineering alternatives to removing soil compaction. Again if implemented this could also improve soil health and may also increase carbon storage. 
3) A clear take home message for me was that the audience liked and trusted more what they saw at field demonstration days and were more likely to give something a try that they had seen demonstrated in the field. 
4) The language we use is very important and even the most unpretentious of phrases such as 'critical depth' can have a completely different meaning to different groups of people.

The event and my participation also got a mention in BASF's internal publication.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c821caca0198.99513654</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>GREAT soils workshop: Soil Health and Farm Viability, Lichfield, 22nd November</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>430D282D-25E3-4365-8803-DEE906C28574</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Following on from previous meetings with Martin Wood, Martin invited me to give a presentation on 'Keeping soil in the field - managing runoff and erosion in row crops' at one of the GREATsoil project events. This project is funded by AHDB Horticulture to inspire and support growers to assess and manage the health of their soils. On this occasion there was only a small, but quite influential group who attended. The main interest of the group was asparagus.

Because it was a small group it enabled useful extended dialog about issues. Interest was expressed on the day of trying some of the approaches that they had heard about. Also a spin-off from the event was a request to assist with a case study that will go out through AHDB and therefore will be seen by their wider horticultural community.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c90f5781e2a3.87903361</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/greatsoils-workshop-soil-health-and-farm-viability-staffordshire-registration-28600293247</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Soil awareness workshop, North Cannon, 24th March</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>73B722BC-73E4-44AF-A0F1-E3D867E4FD0E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The purpose of the event was to offer additional training to farmers/land owners who had breached pollution regulations. It represented a new approach to regulatory activities carried out by the Environment Agency (EA). The course was offered by the EA as an alternative to a fine. This was a pilot course to assess how successful this approach would be. The link with the Fellowship was knowledge exchange that would benefit the horticultural or potato sector. A high proportion of the participants attending the course had been growing potatoes at the time when they caused a pollution breach. While most of the participants were well educated in that they understood the risks of soil erosion, I was able to offer a range of alternative solutions that they could consider. Also, importantly, it allowed participants an opportunity to ask questions so that they had a deeper understanding and were better able to identify solutions that were most applicable to them. Their biggest challenge being able to improve soil management on a parcel of land that was often rented and therefore only used by them over a short period of time. Being able to bring science into this classroom improved the participants understanding of the risks and potential solutions they could use in the future.

The feedback from the first course was positive and there was an expectation that other course would be hosted in the future.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c8195ca86277.12623568</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.gov.uk/government/news/environment-agency-launches-soil-speed-awareness-courses-for-land-management-offenders</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>HDC News, press release</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FEEAC8AE-C6D9-4582-9836-97F014A141A1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Article promoting the Horticultural Knowledge Exchange Fellowship and our role within the Horticulture Innovation Partnership.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cc562e5e2b35.45405012</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Carrot Expert Group Meeting, Thetford, 24th November</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>32AA3DA5-37B0-462D-9666-1EF047B353D9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Attend this meeting with a colleague, Professor Jane Rickson, who gave a talk to the group about soil health as related to carrot production.

While I gave no formal presentation, it was possible during breaks and during the field visit to discuss knowledge exchange activities and the groups enthusiasm for engaging with scientist/research groups.

From our Fellowship perspective this type of meeting represents a potential opportunity for scientists to tap into and an obvious knowledge exchange opportunity. The HAPI community at the 2016 event identified a need for Location specific grower showcase events for scientists, but these may already exist as this Carrot Expert Group meeting and other reported events highlight. The missing like at the moment is connecting these meetings with the scientific community.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c92960c78025.22637525</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Horticulture and Potato Initiative (HAPI) - Dissemination Event, Cambridge, 1-2 March 2016 and 8-9 March 2017</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>18031E71-3A54-49FA-BB12-729E0B225949</gtr:id><gtr:impact>HAPI March 2016 event
Three activities were facilitated by our Fellowship during this HAPI 2016 dissemination event:
1) Icebreaker session. Approximately 60 participants. We were tasked with organising an evening event that would help bring the different groups (industry and science mix) together and that would help individuals to get to know each other better. Using a Tic-Tac-Toe-Scavenger-Hunt participants were given nine questions. Each question involved finding someone in the room who met the description e.g. Find a PhD student who does not work on your HAPI project. The questions involved a mix of work related (as previous example) and more personal e.g. find someone who enjoys a similar hobby to you. Once found they were asked to note down their name and an answer. This exercise has a number of values a) participants are gently encouraged to meet a range of new people, in a fun way, and have a list of names and a known fact about that person to take away. So if they meet that person in the future they have a connection; b) as well as helping the participants get to know each other their behaviour can also be observed e.g. do they work as individuals to complete the task or do they collaborate (no rules are set on this). Often the 'winner' (the person to complete the nine questions first) works as an individual and personal success is important to them. Team players usually do not 'win' but do ensure that the majority achieve success. The activity was very well received, with many positive comments the next day and was still being talked about positively at the following years meeting. Participants who were in the process of building their own personal networks found this activity particularly beneficial.

2) Breakout session - Communication in the horticulture community. Approximately 20 participants. This breakout explored the methods of communication used and preferences. It also asked the participants to consider what forms of communication they felt were needed in order for the HAPI community to build and maintain their community in the future. The outcomes suggested that the funded dissemination meetings worked well and encouraged networking. Location of these events was important given the dispersed nature of the community. They were prepared to travel but it was helpful to have a location with good car parking/public transport links. Networking opportunities, both informal and more structured science and technical session, were felt to be beneficial and important to them. Early career scientist would like to see more events focused at them where they can begin to build their own networks. They would also like better guidance on funding opportunities that are available to them and linked to this more fellowships to help with their training and development.

From the feedback received from this breakout session two future events are being planned: a) A cross disciplinary science exchange meeting, being hosted at the Centre for Ecology &amp;amp; Hydrology; b) A early career scientist event.

C) Breakout session - Resources for horticulture innovation. Approximately 20 participants. The purpose of this breakout session was to share information regarding data, tools, resources and materials available within the HAPI community, and to link members who could mutually benefit each other. During the session the participants were also asked to consider priories for the future by considering what would be needed to address on or more of the six identified industry challenges (changing seasons, crop maturity and spoilage, soil, pests and pathogens, seed quality and vigour, and resource use efficiency).

The data gathered during this session was collated into documents that were sent out to the wider HAPI community via Google Drive. Key documents sent out included tables of Community Needs and Community Resources that listed the need or resource, who was looking for or who had, person who could provide or person who was interested in, and the challenges it most related to. The community was encouraged to add to these document, which remain available to them, but only a few (approximately 4) participants added to these tables after the event.

The future requirements were sent out via Google Drive as figures, where participants had been asked to position the requirement according to its difficulty in being able to acquire and impact. This information remains available to the wider HAPI community.

There is no hard evidence that any direct benefit has come of this exercise, however, individuals were overheard making arrangements on the day to discuss things further. The information gathered here will also be used to draft a future recommendation document and may also form part of a blog. 


HAPI March 2017 Event
Tasked with organising a breakout session on the second day that would engage the mix of industry and science representatives. The activity was used to identifying strategic priorities of the fresh produce supply chain. The participants were asked to consider challenges and opportunities in the UK and overseas (developing countries), they were also asked to identify any previous or current collaborative experience with overseas countries. The final part of the exercise used a Fuzzy Cognitive mapping exercise for groups to identify how challenges may be addressed and the potential for innovative science and technology to overcome any identified gaps and barriers. 

At the event and just after there were very positive comments made about the success of this breakout. It was reported that it engaged everyone and that there was an energy in the room when they were discussing things. The only slight negative was that it was at the end of a busy two day event and people began to tier and/or had to get away so we did curtail the activity by 15 min (out of 2 hour activity). However, I believe that this was the best thing to do so as to leave a good impression. Sufficient information had been collected by this point anyhow. The results of this breakout session will be written up in a report. The report will be sent out to the HAPI community.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c8135e322842.96771533</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016,2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Blog page</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9C8D229F-C2FF-456E-B85C-D003A6CF9EC7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>To help aid dissemination of knowledge to the horticulture and potato food chain we have established a blog page, hosted at http://blogs.cranfield.ac.uk/horticultureandpotatoke. It is hoped that we can use this pathway to talk about issues and solutions relevant to the horticultural and potato food chain that centres of research such as East Malling and Cranfield University can provide advice for. Whilst we potentially have access to a lot of material from the HAPI community it may, because of commercial confidentially, not always be possible to get permission to post certain blogs. We have already encountered issues of getting permission with one of the blogs for this reason. However, in these cases we will seek to explore the reasons behind this and potential ways forward.

The blog page is hosted on the Cranfield University's site. So far we have released two blog pieces: Who cares about horticulture and potato production? (https://blogs.cranfield.ac.uk/agrifood/cares-horticulture-potato-production) and Making an impression (https://blogs.cranfield.ac.uk/agrifood/horticulture/soil-awareness-making-impression). A third blog is just waiting approval to release it.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c958e9e7c0f7.72779943</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://blogs.cranfield.ac.uk/horticultureandpotatoke</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Barfoots of Botley: Asparagus Exchange of Knowledge, Romsey, 5th July</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>287E9E5E-4FF8-4A49-90CA-9D664E510DE6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The activity was to demonstrate and provide evidence for ways of preventing runoff and erosion from asparagus plots. This involved both and outdoor demonstration and a more formal presentation (made by my colleague) in the afternoon. The primary audience were asparagus growers from Bavaria. However, the event was hosted by a UK asparagus grower and other participants were from UK asparagus associations and industry. 

The demonstration and following presentation generated a lot of questions and the European audience seemed impressed at the research that had been undertaken on asparagus in the UK. There was particular interest from them in the use of mulches to protect the soil from erosion. 

The event enabled an insight into the perception of knowledge exchange in another European country. It also confirmed how useful field demonstrations can be in engaging an audience.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c82575005417.77544195</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Meeting with the potato group at NIAB Cambridge, 5 May 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F8EC4FFD-23CD-481D-930A-FD2016E56F0F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This meeting was arranged specifically to discuss KE and communication and how our Fellowship could help support this.

The event brought together a number of operators within the food chain system associated with fruit production. The event made it possible to speak to a range of industry representatives and to gather information with regard to their attitudes to engaging with scientists. It was also possible to advertise our questionnaire that was running at the time and this resulted in an increase in the number of people who filled out the questionnaire around that time.

The event also made it possible to meet with representatives of the industry press and discuss future ideas with them. Not only to get highlights from this Fellowship publicised but to also better understand what advice we needed to give others, in particular scientists, in order for them to publish more prolifically in industrial magazines.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cc7164515f22.32137266</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Food Matters Live, Excell, London, 23rd November</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>983A8FF3-52A6-4A57-B719-A77D97E9D9DA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I attended this event as an opportunity to engage with the wider horticultural food chain, as well as to gauge how well this type of event would work for knowledge exchange. The event not only hosted trade stands but had breakout workshops and discussion zones, a science zone where visitors could engage with scientist about research and professional development.

The event was well attended on the day that I went (whole event hosted over three days). Workshops and discussion groups were all well attended and stimulated a lot of discussion. The event seemed to work well for networking and knowledge exchange across a wide aspect of the food chain system. This was the four year of this event and talking with people on stands the impression was that the enthusiasm for it is still growing.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c91702d1cc70.83340740</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.foodmatterslive.com</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Unlocking innovation through science and collaboration, networking event (London)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B83C1534-24E2-4ADE-9119-7B986AA8602B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Networking event enabling an opportunity to discuss knowledge exchange mechanisms with early career scientists.

Also discussed with individuals, during the breaks, opportunities for them to contribute to science that would have benefit to their industry. The group were also invited to come across to Cranfield in order to show them the Centre For Applied Crop Science facility that is hosted there.

This meeting again demonstrates the existence of sector specific meetings at which industry and science can interact. It also supports the idea that the horticultural industry is keen to acquire and discuss, outputs and opportunities from research.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c92e05041143.60427694</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Vegetable Consultancy Association, visit to Cranfield University, 1st March</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A7C828FA-453F-4BB8-874B-E141AD63A4D2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Members of the Vegetable Consultancy Association (VCA) were invited to Cranfield to show them the Centre for Applied Crop Science (ACS; soil health facility) and The Agricultural Engineering Precision Innovation Centre (Agri-EPI) assets held at Cranfield. These centres were funded under the Agri-Tech strategy and represents a collaboration between academia and industry. They are facilities built specifically with industry academic collaboration in mind. 

The VCA were given presentations on the type of scientific work undertaken at Cranfield that has direct significance to the agricultural and horticultural industries. The group were then given a guided tour of the ACS and Agri-EPI facilities hosted at Cranfield. Following the tour the group were asked to comment on the facilities and were encouraged to discuss potential projects that they saw the facilities being able to address form their perspective.

Actions from this meeting included keeping the VCA advised of potential funding opportunities they could benefit from with respect to undertaking research that is relevant to them. Ideas presented on the day will be considered and, where appropriate, worked up into proposals in collaboration with the VCA.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c9445413da61.23300115</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>AHDB Onion article</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>97671DE5-9D6D-4CD2-984F-2E9FEAD14111</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Under our KE Fellowship role I assisted one of our HAPI projects to produce an industry article that was sent out via an AHDB newsletter.
