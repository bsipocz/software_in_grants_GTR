Recent work from our lab has shown that new neurons are generated in the hypothalamus of adolescent and adult mice. Intriguingly, these neurons appear to be destined for circuits that regulate appetite and energy expenditure. This raises the interesting possibility that these circuits can be modulated to the benefit of human health. In particular, to preserve the healthy functioning of the brain in aged individuals and tackling eating disorders, such as obesity.
We have discovered that the new hypothalamic neurons arise from a unique population of stem cells, called tanycytes. We have also found that these cells express a very important signaling gene, called Fgf10. Our main objectives are to characterize and understand the function/s of Fgf10 in tanycytes. To meet these objectives, we will use well-characterized tissue culture systems and examine the brains of genetically modified mice, in which the functioning of Fgf10 has been abrogated or elevated. We will also investigate the cohort of genes and molecules that Fgf10 may talk to and interact with to exert its functions. 
The generated information will advance our knowledge of brain stem cells and brain function and may well lead to the development of molecular tools to positively modulate brain function.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Until recently, the generation of new neurons in the adult mammalian brain was thought to be restricted to the hippocampal dentate gyrus and the lateral subventricular zone of lateral ventricles, where neural stem cell function has been extensively studied and shown to be regulated by a combination of cell intrinsic and cell extrinsic factors. However, emerging data suggest that new neurons are also generated in postnatal and adult hypothalamus and their prime function is to endow plasticity to neural circuits that regulate energy uptake and expenditure. We have identified the source of these cells as beta tanycytes, a population of radial glial-like cells that occupy the ventral lining of the third ventricle. Very little is known about genes and mechanisms that regulate stem/progenitor cell function in tanycytes, and the steps of adult hypothalamic neurogenesis. To identify these, we will exploit our discovery that in the hypothalamus, Fibroblast growth factor 10 (Fgf10) is uniquely expressed by beta tanycytes. Our objectives are to test whether and how the loss or over expression of Fgf10 affects the ability of beta tanycytes to generate neurospheres in vitro and their ability to divide, survive and generate new appetite/ energy balance regulating neurons in vivo. In a complementary approach, we will search for genes that act downstream of, and the proteins that interact with FGF10 in tanycytes. Combined, these investigations are likely to provide novel inroads into the genetic networks that regulate neural stem cell function in the hypothalamus. Our ultimate goal is to exploit this knowledge to manipulate hypothalamic neurogenesis and preserve its healthy functioning during ageing and prevent or alleviate its malfunctioning which results in eating disorders.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Eating disorders pose a major challenge to human health. At one end of the scale there is a gradual loss of appetite in the elderly exacerbating the effects of age-related decline in these individuals, and at the other there is an alarming rise in the prevalence of obesity, particularly in children. Treatment of obesity and its related syndromes (cardiovascular defects, arthritis and diabetes) has imposed a huge social and financial burden on individuals and health budgets worldwide. The hypothalamus is where external stimuli (hormones and metabolites) converge to regulate appetite and energy expenditure and thus there is an avid search to understand the cellular, molecular and physiological mechanisms through which appetite is normally regulated and can be positively (or negatively) manipulated to meet the above challenges.
Recent exciting discoveries, including those from our own lab, suggests that new neurons are generated in the mammalian hypothalamus by a population of stem/progenitor-like cells termed beta-tanycytes. Moreover, the newly-generated neurons integrate into the appetite/energy balance regulating nuclei. This suggests that the new neurons endow a degree of plasticity and malleability to hypothalamic functions, raising the exciting possibility that hypothalamic neurogenesis can be focally and experimentally manipulated to promote healthy aging in the elderly or to counteract or prevent obesity. To underpin these efforts, in the first instance we need to understand the basic cellular and molecular regulators of neurogenesis in the adult hypothalamus. 
This proposal exploits our discovery that a key member of the fibroblast growth family, namely Fgf10, is expressed uniquely by beta tanycytes, suggestive of important regulatory roles in their maintenance and neurogenic capacity. We now wish to understand the function/s of Fgf10 and use it as bait to dissect the genetic network that regulates tanycytes and adult hypothalamic neurogenesis.
Tanycytes also have important physiological functions, such as the transport of ions and metabolites into the parenchymal cells and so our studies could additionally reveal a novel role/s for Fgf10 in these crucial processes.
Combined, this research will significantly advance our understanding of a unique population of neural stem/progenitor cells in the brain. It may also provide important breakthroughs in preventing or alleviating anorexia in the elderly and obesity in the wider population.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>444752</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited presentation at the Winter meeting of the Anatomical Society of Great Britain and Ireland</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0496EDE5-261C-4869-85E6-08B8C9FF6206</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Progress of our research was presented at this meeting, enabling two new collaborations.

Our main objectives are to learn more about the biology of a population of newly-discovered population of stem cells in the adult brain. This population of cells, called tanycytes, are of particular interest and importance because they reside in close proximity to areas of the brain that control level and frequency of food uptake (appetite) and energy expenditure. Previously, we showed that tanycytes divide and supply the brain's appetite-regulating circuitry with new cells (neurons), implying that these circuits are flexible in their functionality
Thus, if we knew what genes regulate the biology of tanycytes (for example, the rate at which they divide and generate new cells), we may be in a position to change the behavior of tanycytes and ultimately regulate appetite. For now, we are investigating this possibility in genetically modified rodents, but we are confident that as mice replicate human physiology, any findings in these animals will apply directly to humans. 
Discovery:
A key gene that is active in tancytyes is called 'Fibroblast growth factor 10', or FGF10 for short.
 In line with the proposed aims of the project, we have now used compound transgenic mice to silence the functioning of FGF10 in tanycytes and simultaneously follow their fate and that of their daughters in their normal environment in the brain (in vivo). Our recent discoveries show that deletion of FGF10 from these cells, initially perturbs the rate at which they divide, but ironically, the daughters of tanycytes become more proliferative and generate more cells. This suggests that FGF10 normal has multiple roles, possibly with a short-acting effect that has a knock on effect on other biological processes. 
Our follow on studies are aimed at understanding how FGF10 brings about these effects. For example, what genes are controlled by FGF10. 
in more recent work, we have compared the transcriptome of Fgf10-expressing and Fgf10-deficient hypothalamus, leading to identification of at least 4 very important genes. Two of these relate to neurotransmitters that regulate appetite/energy expenditure and one to a microRNA that regulates stem cell function. We have validated these changes through in situ hybridisation and immunulabelling and are investigating their hierarchy within gene networks that regulate postnatal hypothalamic neurogenesis.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The information we have generated so far will be valuable to ourselves and others. First, it verifies that FGF10 is an important factor in biology of tanycytes and worth following up at molecular level. 
Second, FGF10 is also an important regulator of organ formation during embryonic development, as exemplified by mutations that cause human defects in limbs, ears, salivary and submandibular glands in LADD and ALSG syndromes. Thus, knowing more about how FGF10 functions in one system - in our case, tanycytes - will provide valuable clues about it functionality in other systems.
Our findings are quite recent and in their infancy. However, once we have understood more about the molecular targets and partners of FGF10, we can share this information with chemists/ pharmaceutical organizations to devise ways of modulating FGF10 function as means of modulating tanycyte biology and ultimately appetite/ energy expenditure. This is particularly pertinent in view of rising and prevalent levels of eat disorders such as obesity, which are placing a burden on health services and the affected individuals.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>749E8F3A-17F1-42D9-9707-AD3E03ED896A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546348b0d10687.15883863</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>12684E9C-FC69-46AE-BF40-DA99CB438B17</gtr:id><gtr:title>Hypothalamic tanycytes-masters and servants of metabolic, neuroendocrine, and neurogenic functions.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Frontiers in neuroscience</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6109f4ea483f4892d3194fadd0d5eeca"><gtr:id>6109f4ea483f4892d3194fadd0d5eeca</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Goodman T</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1662-453X</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56d9c0920713c3.43214317</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>57439C98-44A2-4883-B886-8C13889B211C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Interrogation of a lacrimo-auriculo-dento-digital syndrome protein reveals novel modes of fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10) function.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Biochemical journal</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/3a4367ea7e075718037aa7c007af8dc8"><gtr:id>3a4367ea7e075718037aa7c007af8dc8</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mikolajczak M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0264-6021</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58c6ccb6b75dc5.74398658</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/L003406/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>A442BF36-F335-483E-9282-F3BB48AC2C47</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cell biology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D3FE6EA5-4508-4525-8DA5-4D78DF7F3BAC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cell cycle</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>73EF98E1-3FA8-46A0-BE46-00AE16C7D999</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Communication &amp; signalling</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>CF8D454F-63BF-45A6-8974-473A3150758A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Stem cell biology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
