They appear as vortices in superfluid liquid helium, in superconductors and in liquid crystals. They appear in elementary-particle physics as strings and monopoles. In theories of the early universe, cosmic strings that end on domain walls between regions of different vacua are predicted to arise as the universe cools.

In the last decade it has become possible to create Bose-Einstein condensates where the atoms retain their quantum-mechanical spin. This leads to a wider range of topological defects, where structures formed by the spins of the atoms play a crucial role. In particular, the topological defects in such spinor Bose-Einstein condensates have important mathematical analogies with cosmic strings and other topological defects in cosmology and elementary-particle physics. Our research will use extensive computer simulations to investigate how recent experimental advances can be employed to study the physics of so-called topological defects in Bose-Einstein condensates, which are highly controllable and observable with today's experimental technology. Our considerations carry over to a novel type of quantum gas that has recently been created in experiments: Bose-Einstein condensates of short-lived light-matter hybrid particles.

The structure and stability of the defects are influenced by the magnitude of the atomic spin as well as by the nature of the atomic interactions and externally imposed fields. It is possible to create condensates of atoms that carry more than one unit of spin. This results in a drastically enlarged range of possible defect configurations - including highly intriguing non-Abelian vortices - whose structure and stability we will determine, in order to predict experimentally observable states. When long-range interactions are taken into account, the effects may be pronounced already in atoms with one unit of spin. Artificially created gauge-fields that couple spin and spatial motion have the potential to stabilise and make observable otherwise unstable structures. Our research will use and expand the classic Gross-Pitaevskii model to account for these effects and predict experimentally observable states.

Placing the spinor condensate, for example, in an optical lattice created with laser beams enhances the role of quantum fluctuations, such that quantum-mechanical effects can become observable on a macroscopic scale. In this research we will develop theory for describing the spinor condensate in this strongly fluctuating regime and describe observable quantum effects, such as dynamical instabilities of vortices.

A similar theoretical development can be used to describe the condensation transition in gases of exciton-polaritons, which are short-lived light-matter hybrid &amp;quot;quasiparticles&amp;quot; that exist in semiconductor structure sandwiched between mirrors. The short lifetime means that the gas must be constantly replenished, and the condensate exists in a dynamic balance between pumping and decay, rather than in thermal equilibrium. The polarisation of the photon component leads to an effective spin of 1/2. We will collaborate closely with experiment to predict spin structures and topological defects arising in the pumping dynamics in novel experiments specifically designed to study the condensation process.

Our research will highlight how quantum gases provide novel media for the stability properties of field-theoretical defects and textures, with the intriguing prospect of studying analogues of cosmological phenomena in the laboratory.

The research will be conducted at the University of Southampton, host to considerable expertise in quantum gases, and to leading experimental and theoretical research in exciton-polariton condensates. Close collaboration with experiment forms an integral part of the research. The research will make extensive use of the IRIDIS supercomputing facillity.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research focuses on topological defects and macroscopic signatures of quantum mechanics in coherent quantum gases, specifically Bose-Einstein condensates with spin degree of freedom and pumped condensates of quasi particles, exciton-polaritons, in solid-state systems. The research is predicted to be of immediate interest to the superfluids community, where the study of topological defects forms one of the corner stones, the ultracold-atoms community, where spin effects are central to areas of recent experimental interest, and the solid-state condensates community working to understand Bose-Einstein condensation in unconventional systems.

Outside these areas of immediate interest, we identify three areas of impact of the proposed research. The first key impact is defined by the idea of using controllable quantum systems as laboratory testbeds, where physical phenomena and models inspired by other areas of physics can be studied. Modern experimental technology in atomic physics provides accurate measurements and unprecedented control over experimental parameters, making quantum gases prime candidates for this endeavour. Optical-lattice can emulate models from solid-state physics. Topological defects, such as vortices, in Bose-Einstein condensates exhibit important analogies with objects appearing in theories of the early universe and in elementary-particle physics. In the Bose-Einstein condensate the topological defects can be studied experimentally with a high degree of precision. The proposed research provides a theoretical underpinning for such studies by describing the expected behaviour of spinor defects under experimentally relevant scenarios. It is thus imperative that the outcomes of the research are published in journal reaching the wider physics community, as well as presented at scientific conferences attracting a wide audience.

The second key impact is represented by the possibility of using macroscopically coherent systems to construct ultra-sensitive detectors and fast opto-electronic devices. Here exciton-polariton condensates play a key role. These condensates are created in solid-state devices, which makes them suitable for integration in compact electronic equipment. In addition, Bose-Einstein condensation is achieved at temperatures that do not require the highly sophisticated cooling technology needed to create atomic condensates. Even condensation at room temperature is a possibility. This also makes solid-state condensates likely candidates for technological use of macroscopic coherence. Such techniques are likely first to be developed in research laboratories, and may later lead to applications outside basic research. The key step to impact is here provided by the close collaboration with experimental research.

The third impact is represented by the dissemination of basic research to the general public. The internet and social media today provide increasingly greater opportunities for interactive contact with the interested public, contributing to a healthy public discourse on science policy. Dissemination of the goals and outcomes of the proposed research will show not only basic research in quantum gases, but also demonstrate how seemingly distant areas of physics can benefit from each other. A specific goal of public engagement will therefore be to highlight this aspect. This will primarily be achieved through a dedicated web-page accessible to a general audience. Social media may also be employed to facilitate and interactive discourse.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>199381</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Ultra-cold atomic gases provide systems that are highly experimentally accessible and provide unprecedented control over experimental parameters. The research in this project has advanced the theory behind using such systems to investigate the fundamental physics of complex superfluids as well as for the purpose of simulating objects and phenomena from other areas of physics, where they may be difficult or impossible to study in controlled experiments. Such studies can contribute, e.g., to the understanding of so-called cosmic strings in theories of the early universe, or exotic objects in high-energy physics relating to central questions such as the monopole problem (why are there no isolated magnetic charges?) and quark confinement (why do we not observe free quarks). They can also help us understand the roles of different kinds of forces acting between particles, such as atoms, in large ensembles.

In this vein, we this research project has resulted in three key discoveries, two of which have been published to date.

1. We have proposed experimental protocols for how atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (ultra-cold gases where all atoms in the gas occupy the same quantum state, creating a manifestation of quantum mechanics on a macroscopic scale) can be used to study so-called non-Abelian vortices in the laboratory. Vortices in Bose-Einstein condensates are mathematically similar to objects appearing in seemingly remote areas of physics, such as cosmic strings or liquid crystals. Non-Abelian vortices are associated with a highly constrained dynamics that has so far never been investigated in experiment, despite considerable efforts in liquid crystals to create the conditions where they might occur. Our research suggests a path to a first physical system where these objects may be reliably studied.

2. Where a vortex in a bathtub drain, or even in simple superfluids, have an empty centre, this is not true in the more complex superfluids formed when the quantum-mechanical so-called spin of the atom is allowed to play a role. Cooling of such gases to ultralow temperatures results in a state called a spinor Bose-Einstein condensate. In these, the inside of a vortex does not have to be empty. We have described how complex and unexpected structures can form inside vortices, and how such states could be engineered in experiment. This can allow the research community not only to better understand the fundamental physics of the spinor Bose-Einstein condensates, but can also allow a better understanding of phenomena that have analogues in condensed-matter physics, or one can study so-called Skyrmion textures confined inside the vortex, which may help shed light on high-energy theories connected with fundamental open questions regarding, e.g., the existence, or non-existence, of magnetic monopoles.

3. So far we have considered the atoms in the ultra-cold gas to be similar to billiard balls bouncing off each other. This is called contact interaction and it acts only when atoms collide and is the same in all directions. However, certain atoms exhibits a magnetic dipole moment, meaning they behave like little bar magnets. This allows them to exert a force on each other that acts over a longer distance, and is also not the same in every direction. We have constructed a theoretical model system to show how this can lead to entirely new effects on vortices, which we can use to understand the underlying principles when considering the more complex case of some possible experimental realisations.

Together all of our key findings provide theoretical underpinning for an area where experimental research is accelerating rapidly with several recent high-profile experiments. Our results can in principle prompt immediate experimental efforts to study this new physics in the laboratory.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The key findings of this research are of a fundamental-physics nature, and the immediate beneficiaries are within the academic community. Here, however, due to well-received publications as well as successful engagement with, in particular, experimenters via conferences (in particular the DAMOP series) there is good reason to hope for an immediate impact of our research on ongoing experimental efforts. Further, the field of topological defects in spinor systems has now advance via both theoretical research and, in particular, recent experiments that have prepared analogues of magnetic monopoles and quantum so-called knot solitons. These results now provide new and inspiring opportunities to popularise this otherwise not easily accessible area of basic research. In a wider context, our results form part of a research development that is likely to be of interest to a wider science-communication community, including, e.g., educators and science journalists.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B8B7AEE7-5725-4661-BD1D-3AE9CB3616D8</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dee7d72773e9.14672155</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Computational data underlying the results published in M.O.
