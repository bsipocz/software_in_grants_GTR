Analysts and policy-makers seeking to resolve these conflicts have applied territorial and ideological frames of analysis which do not address the underlying causes of the conflict, from the perspective of the forces and movements involved. Although these conflicts had their roots in decolonisation, a number of factors (including the artificial nature of post-colonial states, unresolved questions of ethnic identity and uneven development within national borders) led to continued conflict after the achievement of independence. Ideological (left-right) frameworks of analysis ascribed to movements in a Cold War context is a limited guide to their causes. Similarly, attempts to understand and resolve these conflicts through national and inter-national frameworks overlook both the transnational nature of the movements concerned, and the local identities which inform them. Conflicts are interpreted as either civil wars within states, or conventional wars between states, without taking into account the mutable but powerful cross-border identities and communities (ethnic, social and economic) which have formed the basis of military and political movements. Analysing such factors enables new historically informed understandings of movements and conflicts which are simultaneously local, national and trans-national. This project will therefore examine how the participants in a number of the interrelated conflicts that have affected Central Africa since the 1960s have understood their role in those conflicts. Improved comprehension of the recent history of such conflicts and movements will enable those seeking to resolve contemporary conflicts in Central Africa to better comprehend the motivations of combatants. \n\nThis research explores these questions through a case study of the Katangese gendarmes, one of the most important but least studied military and political movements in post-colonial Africa, which has been neglected by researchers because it acted and defined itself against conventional frameworks: across ideological Cold War boundaries; the fragile borders of post-colonial states; and conventional definitions of 'war'. The gendarmes were seen in the 1960s as 'neo-colonial' tools of mining capital in the secession of Katanga from the newly independent Congo (DRC). They later crossed the porous border into Portuguese-ruled Angola, where their ethnic Lunda cousins resided; there, they fought with Portuguese colonialists against Angolan nationalists. With Angolan independence in 1975, the gendarmes, now politically constituted as the National Front for the Liberation of Congo (FNLC), allied with the Marxist government against Congolese-backed rebels. In 1977-78, the gendarmes launched two (unsuccessful) invasions of Zaire, perceived by western observers as the actions of Marxist rebels. In 1980, gendarmes participated in a coup attempt in Zambia. Seventeen years later, they were part of the forces of Laurent Kabila which ousted President Mobutu. Investigating the gendarmes' understanding of their apparently contradictory actions requires an interrogation of the meaning of the post-colonial Congolese state and the ideological basis of nationalism and state formation in Africa. We also need to understand the salience of 'Lunda' as an ethno-linguistic category and its capacity to transgress the post-colonial borders of Angola, Zambia and the DRC. This research builds on work carried out by Dr Larmer since 2008, supported by a British Academy Small Grant in 2007-08. It argues that the gendarmes' identification with 'Katanga' as a place remains central, notwithstanding its non-existence as a state since 1963. Indeed, the extinguishing of that identity strengthened aspiration to a statehood that was powerful because it was denied. For these reasons, 'Katanga' was and remains a malleable but potent local-transnational identity.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The outputs of this project will be of interest to a wide range of academic and non-academic beneficiaries. \n\nThis project has been designed to ensure that its research into the historical causes of conflict in central Africa reaches not only an academic audience, but also policy-makers and practitioners interested in conflict resolution in Africa. The proposed monograph, which will be prepared for publication during the period of the Research Fellowship, will be written in a way that will make it accessible to both its academic and non-academic audience. \n\nProject findings will be disseminated via the PI's existing links to Africa and conflict-oriented thinktanks in Europe, for example the Dag Hammarskjold Foundation (DHF) based in Uppsala, Sweden. The DHF has already invited the PI to publicise the research findings via its publications and events. \n\nThe project will form part of the University of Sheffield's Centre for Peace History, which will aid dissemination to a wider academic community and enable comparative analyses on the causes of conflict in Central Africa. These outputs will also be accessible to non-academic beneficiaries via the Centre's webpage. A public presentation of the research findings will also be carried out at the University, targeted at members of the public concerned with issues of conflict and peace in Africa; target audiences will include members of the Congolese diaspora in Sheffield and the local branch of the United Nations Association, both of which the PI has existing links. This is provisionally timetabled for June 2012. \n\nAcademic audiences will include the following: \n\nAfrican historians: the study will greatly add to understanding of the empirical history of the movement concerned and its role in a series of inter-related conflicts in Angolan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia during the period under study. \n\nCold War historians: the study provides significant new understanding and evidence of the ways in which the Cold War influenced (and was influenced by) local and national forces. The role of Cuba in the Angolan civil war, and of the United States and other western governments in Zaire in the 1960s and 1970s, is explored in ways which provide important new interpretations of the relationship between the Cold War and local conflicts during this period. \n\nConflict and peace studies: the inter-disciplinary study of conflict resolution and peace-making seeks to understand the underlying causes of warfare and the ways in which these can be resolved. In providing new evidence for the causes of conflict in Central Africa, particularly involving non-state actors, the project findings will be of interest to those seeking to understand and resolve contemporary conflicts in Central Africa and elsewhere, involving militias and non-state actors that operate across state borders. \n\nTransnational and border studies: this research connects with a growing trend in African studies that recognises the inadequacy of examining African experiences within the confines of a nation-state. The particular impact of Africa's boundaries and borders, and the extent to which they are transgressed or utilised by individual or collective Africans, has emerged as a prominent area of research - notably in the African Borderland Research Network (ABORNE), which the PI is in the process of joining. Having already presented a well received paper on the preliminary research to a conference on 'Boundaries and Independences in Africa' held in Paris in May 2010, the PI is confident the research findings will be of particular interest to this group. \n\nThe project findings will be disseminated to academic audiences through the publication of two articles in leading academic journals. Papers will be presented at leading academic conferences, including the African Studies Association of the United State</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>66282</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The findings were disseminated to policy-makers and non-govermental institutions concerned with peace-building in Africa, particularly in the DR Congo.
