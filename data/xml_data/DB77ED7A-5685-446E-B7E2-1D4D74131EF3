You know that it is a fair coin. That is, you know that there is a 50% chance that it will land heads. But this is all you know. How confident should you be that it will land heads? 50%, surely. That is, you should treat the chance of it landing heads as a sort of expert to whose opinion you defer when forming your own. This is known as the Principal Principle. Another sort of expert to whose opinion it seems you should defer when forming your current opinion is your future self. If you know that your future self will be 70% confident in a particular outcome, you should have 70% confidence yourself, at least in normal circumstances. After all, your future self is typically better informed than you are, and has had longer to weigh the evidence. This is known as the Reflection Principle. The central question of this research project is this: Why should we obey the Principal Principle and the Reflection Principle? In what way do we err if we violate either of them?\n\nAbove, I motivated these principles by appealing to certain intuitions we have about how we should form our opinion. But intuitions are notoriously unreliable and often vary depending on how they are elicited. So ideally we would like a more reliable, rigorous justification for these norms. Such justifications have been rather lacking in the philosophical literature. In this project, I will investigate the possibility of giving a more rigorous justification by appealing to a new strategy that has been used to great effect in answering related questions. The idea is this: Given a way that the world might be, certain levels of confidence are better than others. For instance, someone who has a very high degree of confidence in all truths and a very low degree of confidence in all falsehoods has better opinions than someone who has high confidence in falsehoods and low in truths. Inspired by this, some philosophers have tried to define a measure of how good a given opinion is for a particular way the world might be. With this sort of measure in hand, we might give a more rigorous justification of the Principal Principle and the Reflection Principle in the following way. Suppose it were the case that, whenever you had some opinions that violate the Principal Principle, then there were some opinions that satisfy it that you might have instead and that are better than your actual opinions (according to the measure of goodness of opinions) given any possible way the world could be. Then, it seems, this would justify the Principal Principle. After all, it would be better to do what that principle says you should do however the world turns out to be. So this way of arguing for the Principal Principle promises a rigorous justification if it works. And we might hope for a similar argument for the Reflection Principle.\n\nDoes it work? My initial research shows that it does providing certain detailed philosophical claims about objective chances and future selves can be established. This research project seeks to provide the philosophical underpinnings required to make this argument work.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>At the time of planning, there are no obvious ways in which this research project will have a specifiable impact outside the areas of academic research identified in the previous section. The questions addressed by the project concern precise explication of epistemic norms and their justification: Why is it that we should obey certain norms that we intuitively take to govern our opinions? How are these intuitive norms to be made precise and fully general? In neither case will the answers I develop change behaviour in such a way that it could have a societal or economic impact, either negative or positive. But it will give greater understanding of these norms, and a greater insight into the ways in which we ought to form our opinions.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>26844</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The main outcome of this grant is a much clearer understanding of the role of norms in Bayesian epistemology that tell us how our degrees of beliefs in hypotheses about the objective chances should relate to our degrees of belief in propositions to which the objective chances assign a probability. In 'Accuracy, Chance, and the Principal Principle', I provided a novel accuracy-based argument for the most popular of these so-called chance-credence norms. In 'What Chance-Credence Norms Should Not Be', I explained why a particular popular formulation of these principles leads to undesirable conclusions in the presence of a particular metaphysics of chance. In 'Indispensability Arguments and Instrumental Nominalism', I showed how to formulate instrumental nominalism in such a way that it might be used to answer the standard indispensability arguments for platonism.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The novel accuracy argument for the Principal Principle has already attracted a great deal of attention (24 citations to date). It provides a template for arguing for other principles of rationality in Bayesian epistemology. The argument against the popular formulation of the Principal Principle, whilst having received less attention, is, I think, potentially more influential. It really shows that a certain metaphysics for chances cannot hope to accommodate chance-credence principles.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>63507686-FBE7-4A09-9C5B-7BA43D32FB0A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56cb34039194d5.53893200</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9A0FFD72-BA30-4FBF-B5D5-15496BA3F6C9</gtr:id><gtr:title>A NEW EPISTEMIC UTILITY ARGUMENT FOR THE PRINCIPAL PRINCIPLE</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Episteme</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/51591c89fed7a61a2af51b835260c59c"><gtr:id>51591c89fed7a61a2af51b835260c59c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pettigrew R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>585d4a6b07d5b5.02682836</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>70995236-6252-4B4F-BA0D-CDEDE3E1A466</gtr:id><gtr:title>What Chance-Credence Norms Should Not Be</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>No?s</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/51591c89fed7a61a2af51b835260c59c"><gtr:id>51591c89fed7a61a2af51b835260c59c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pettigrew R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>541c25ce337d90.92553949</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>48D1CC47-219A-4D12-8C49-8916D8D03027</gtr:id><gtr:title>Accuracy, Chance, and the Principal Principle</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Philosophical Review</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/51591c89fed7a61a2af51b835260c59c"><gtr:id>51591c89fed7a61a2af51b835260c59c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pettigrew R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d07c07ce049b9d</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0B4348FA-5495-4838-86C0-F1D427E671B9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Epistemic Utility and Norms for Credences</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Philosophy Compass</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/51591c89fed7a61a2af51b835260c59c"><gtr:id>51591c89fed7a61a2af51b835260c59c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pettigrew R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>585d4a6d34cc86.19693091</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6A6F42D7-3621-43A7-8128-C7C306D9BF89</gtr:id><gtr:title>Accuracy and Evidence</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Dialectica</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/51591c89fed7a61a2af51b835260c59c"><gtr:id>51591c89fed7a61a2af51b835260c59c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pettigrew R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>585d4a6c0be996.81279475</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>FEFCD597-8D5E-44BD-AF3C-1EA47F6D4875</gtr:id><gtr:title>INDISPENSABILITY ARGUMENTS AND INSTRUMENTAL NOMINALISM</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Review of Symbolic Logic</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2451f3eae7df86f6bab98655f449f0dd"><gtr:id>2451f3eae7df86f6bab98655f449f0dd</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>PETTIGREW R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>541c25cedc8231.36778060</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I027363/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>946C0541-464B-43A5-9EE3-65C23360E959</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Philosophy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>C3FAF999-8402-446C-8A80-016962744E22</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Epistemology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
