It is estimated to cost the UK government in excess of &amp;pound;21 billion per year. Furthermore, the problem is not restricted to alcohol-dependent individuals as the NHS estimate that over 9 million individuals drink more than the recommended guidelines in England alone. It is therefore unsurprising that alcohol control strategies are a key area of interest for health professionals and policy makers. 

Alcohol labels are currently under consideration by the UK Government and the European Union (EU) [2] and an EU Alcohol Strategy for 2016-2022 is expected to include recommendations to include information regarding calories, alcoholic units and the negative health consequences of heavy alcohol consumption. Providing consumers with health-relevant information will educate and promote healthier choices, such as choosing products with lower alcoholic units or reducing overall intake. Labelling interventions have been applied to cigarette and food packaging and have proven effective in encouraging positive behaviour change [3]. However, there is relatively little research investigating the effectiveness of alcohol labelling interventions on positive behaviour change. This work is essential as the effectiveness of labelling is entirely dependent on the right information being presented and it being delivered in the best way possible. 

Across a series of stakeholder meetings (with publicans, policy-makers and health professions), online surveys and focus groups with alcohol consumers, we will explore what information should be presented and question the effects this information is likely to have. This will involve asking all parties about the information they think would be useful, effective and feasible. We will also provide information and gather opinion on the three main areas of product information currently under consideration: calories, alcohlic units and health warnings.

In additional to the fundamental question of &amp;quot;what&amp;quot; information should be provided, we will also consider how the effects of this information may differ among different consumer groups. This will enable us to develop interventions that are targeted to specific groups in which they are likely to be the most effective, thereby maximising impact. In addition, it is vital to consider unintended negative consequences that may be a unique characteristic of alcohol labelling. Particular areas of concern are calorie information promoting reduction in food intake rather than alcohol consumption, and alcohol unit or real-time feedback of drinking behaviour in young binge drinkers (who may use the information to &amp;quot;compete&amp;quot; with peers) increasing intake or drinking speed. 

A final innovative (as-yet unexplored) question is how the information can be communicated to consumers beyond product labels. People often do not come into direct content with product labels when they drink in bars and clubs. We will explore novel methods of information delivery and assess their likely impact. This will include beer mats and menus which are already common in licensed premises and therefore can be rolled out easily and cheaply, However, we will also consider emerging technologies (e.g., digital stickers than can be placed on glasses) which will play an important role in the future of consumer communication. This will ensure that this project will be at the cutting edge of intervention design. This work will be a vital first step in the design and production of evidence-based labels (and other mediums of information delivery). These instruments will be used in future research that will assess if drinking behaviour and drinking attitudes are changed when consumers drink in their presence. Therefore in addition to creating the instruments, we will produce protocols for the research to be taken forward into the next phase of intervention development.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>In England approximately 9 million individuals drink more than the recommended guidelines, according to NHS figures. Furthermore heavy episodic drinking (a.k.a., binge drinking) is common, particularly among young people, and is associated with increased risk of accidents, violence, alcohol abuse problems and ill-health. Excessive alcohol consumption substantially contributes to the global burden of disease, and is estimated to cost the UK government in excess of &amp;pound;21 billion annually.

Choice architecture interventions are designed to encourage healthier choices by changing aspects of the environment. For example, health warnings on cigarette packets have proven effective at changing knowledge and behaviours in ways that promote health. However, there is a serious lack of research investigating the nature and potential impact of labelling for alcohol products. The effectiveness of alcohol product labelling is entirely dependent on the quality of the information, for which there should be a sound evidence base. It is essential that we understand which types of information will be most effective, and identify any unintended consequences (such as calorie information reducing food intake rather than alcohol consumption). 

This project will address this important gap in knowledge, by engaging a wide range of key stakeholders (brewers, the public, local authorities and clinicians) to gather informed opinion on the types of information that should be delivered, perceptions of feasibility, acceptability and impact. We will also address the additional questions of how the effects information may differ across consumer sub-types (in order to identify whether information can be tailored or targeted) and investigate novel and innovative methods of information delivery (introducing emerging technologies). These additional questions will be instrumental in maximising impact and reach of labelling interventions to be developed in the latter stages of this project.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-01-03</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-07-04</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>148304</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>An animated video is currently being developed to demonstrate the possible uses of digital labelling to provide consumers with information about alcoholic drinks.

The workshop aimed to advance understanding of what might work in fostering low risk consumption of alcohol in line with governmental limits by the use of warning messages in various forms and settings. The workshop was multidisciplinary, e.g., from health education and communications, marketing, psychology, public health, and sociology, and covered research from diverse approaches. All attendees chose to share their contact details following the workshop and plans have been made for a follow-up workshop in London for 2018. 

The conference is linked to a special edition of Alcohol and Alcoholism, and we have been invited to submit a paper to this based on this presentation.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bd8ff610ad83.60278821</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.alcoholwarninglabels.info/workshop</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Local brewery event (Bristol)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5DC25B53-EBED-4ECD-89B6-B078E55D1E41</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Three members of the research team attended an event at a local brewery (Good Chemistry Brewing) as part of Bristol Beer Week, which is an annual event run by local businesses. The team took part in the second night of academic talks at the brewery, with a one-hour slot to raise the profile of research undertaken by the Tobacco and Alcohol Research Group, including the alcohol labelling project, and get initial public feedback. This was a great opportunity to talk to the public about the potential harms of alcohol and the use of nudging techniques (i.e. alcohol labelling) to subtly modify the drinking environment in order to impact behaviour, as well as getting feedback from people working within the alcohol industry. The group explored perspectives on providing units, calories and health-related messages on alcohol products. Group discussion raised a number of themes, including the role of the alcohol industry to educate the public, the ability for labelling alone to impact on behaviour as well as the acceptability of warnings to responsible drinkers, and the need for targeted approaches to reach high-risk drinkers. These ideas were important in the development of the public survey, which was conducted in Phase 1 of the labelling project (July-December 2016).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bd8c10094f30.35118785</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.bristolbeerweek.com/calendar/think-while-you-drink-at-gchq-part-2</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Phase one of this project involved a large public survey and a series of stakeholder meetings. A key aim of this activity was to inform a suite of alcohol product labels that have been identified as having good potential for positive impact (e.g., by promoting reduction of drinking, positive health-related attitudes). These labels include novel health warnings and novel ways of presenting calorie and unit information (e.g., through interactive beer mats). These have been developed and can be used in laboratory-based research studies to directly investigate the effects of labelling and information delivery on key outcomes (e.g., drinking behaviour, attitudes).</gtr:description><gtr:id>F771498C-AA0F-4936-955E-12145285339D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This project is in the phase of label development, and therefore the suite of labels are yet to be distributed.

They will be a key output from this project and therefore distribution and impact is expected to follow conclusion of this grant.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c12da46f77c9.30573477</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Suite of prototype alcohol product labels</gtr:title><gtr:type>Model of mechanisms or symptoms - human</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/N027450/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>7C58A707-1BF6-4573-A44F-30B271C80813</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cancer</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>D4FDB752-4E9C-491F-9C63-B7D7F6F95417</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cardiovascular</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>D81A471F-556F-4570-BF6A-5D197943223C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Oral and Gastrointestinal</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>A77DAE3A-499B-4F46-971D-6C82F51F9C2E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Stroke</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>5841ECCD-C9B1-4B8B-993F-ACC8E9585125</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>3.1  Primary preventions interventions to modify behaviours or promote well-being</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
