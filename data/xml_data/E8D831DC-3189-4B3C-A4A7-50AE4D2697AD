Examples include blood flow in veins and arteries, and air flow in the airways and lungs. Industrial and medical devices may also contain fluid-filled tubes with elastic walls. (Even pipes with seemingly rigid walls will have some degree of flexibility, and can be regarded as being elastic.) It is therefore important to understand the underlying physics of such flows, and to have mathematical models that allow us to predict how such flows will behave. In this project, sophisticated mathematical techniques will be used to investigate a particular problem in this area.

Experiments show that even with a steady pumping of fluid along an elastic-walled tube, the wall can spontaneously begin to oscillate in and out. In such cases, the steady flow is said to be unstable. In other cases, an initially imposed deformation will be seen to result in oscillations of decreasing amplitude, and the tube returns to a steady configuration. In these cases the steady flow is said to be stable. For a given industrial setup or biological system, it is important to know whether the flow will be stable or unstable, as it will lead to quite different behaviours. Sometimes the oscillations resulting from an unstable situation will be beneficial (e.g. to help with mixing or dislodging foreign objects) and sometimes not (e.g. leading to energy losses or unwanted vibrations).

In this research, mathematical modelling and numerical simulations will help improve our understanding of the causes these oscillatory instabilities, and help us predict precisely when a flow in a given tube will be stable and unstable. In cases where the flow is unstable, we will also be able to predict the form, frequency and the growth rate of the resulting oscillations. These results will, in turn, suggest ways in which one might prevent or promote the oscillations in different situations.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The immediate beneficiaries of the proposed research will mostly be other researchers in the field, who will be able to learn from the results and utilise them in the their own research, as described elsewhere in this proposal. In the longer term, the results from the proposed research, together with results from further research building thereon, will have applications in a number of areas.

In biological systems, there are many examples of fluid-filled elastic-walled tubes. In the cardiovascular system, cardiovascular disease is one of the leading causes of mortality in the western world. Research to improve our understanding of the complex fluid-structure interactions in veins and arteries has the potential to lead to significant improvements in health-care. In particular, the proposed research will have direct applications to non-invasive blood pressure measurement, where vessel walls will be strongly compressed by the external pressure cuff. Better understanding the behaviours of vessels in this scenario will help improve the accuracy and robustness of continuous non-invasive measurement devices for automatic unattended monitoring of patients.

Other applications will arise in an industrial-design context. If, as expected, the results of the research show that the bucked base-state increases the stability of the fundamental mode, then this would provide an alternative method to stabilise flows that would otherwise be susceptible to such oscillations. Conversely, if oscillations are desired for mixing or homogenisation purposes, then the results will help engineers construct regimes in which the desired mixing is
achieved. Mixing via oscillations of this type would be beneficial in systems that must be sealed (e.g. for containment or bio-security reasons), since it requires no rotary or sliding joints.

In both of the areas above, impact will be achieved by following the steps outlined in the &amp;quot;Pathways to Impact&amp;quot; document. The PI's experience in working with industrial and biological collaborators will be a significant asset in translating and applying the mathematical results to specific real-life problems. The fundamental results themselves will also be widely disseminated and publicised (both nationally and internationally), in order to maximise availability to, and hence use by, third-parties.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>98567</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/N007212/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>02B9E893-AC2F-436D-BF88-28E1AC827F5D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Continuum Mechanics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
