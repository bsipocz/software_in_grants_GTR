The scheme would work to strengthen the investigators' links and experience established via Asia Triennial Manchester and other curatorial projects through its initiation and consolidation of a transnational, interdisciplinary and cross-institutional dialogue on the topic of the economics of Chinese border crossings in art and design. The core members of the network would include the P.I., key staff from the partner organisations of National Cheng Kung University - Dr Ming Turner (C.I.); Castlefield Gallery - Kwong Lee, director, Centre For Chinese Contemporary Art (CFCCA) - Sarah Fisher, director and Peiyi Lu curator, Hong Kong Polytechnic University and Community Museum Project (CMP), King Chung Siu, professor and director: as well as international key academics in the areas of Contemporary Chinese Art and border studies, including: Professor Jim Aulich from MIRIAD, Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU) and Professor Paul Gladston from the University of Nottingham.

Whilst other academic and cultural research initiatives have focused on border crossings in China and other continents in relation to theatre (see www.bordercrossings.org.uk), gender (see http://shass.mit.edu/news/news-2012-symposium-launches-research-initiative-citizenship-identity-borders), this research network will interrogate the timely topic of Chinese borders in relation to Chinese and Chinese islands' transnational art and design practices. The research would focus in particular on economic factors of trade, opportunities and political context, drawing from artworks and exhibitions such as http://leapleapleap.com/2011/04/border-crossings/. Contemporary art historical projects concerning borders tend to focus on issues of national identity that are often framed in terms of how 'indigenous' cultural identities respond to new forms of cultural 'hybridity' due to movement across national or ethnic boundaries. Such approaches restrict the research focus to the interrogation of cultural histories, elements of Post-colonial discourse and/or in relation to intersections with other identity politics. This network would further consider such literal and metaphorical cultural border crossings between China, Taiwan and Hong Kong but through a socio-economic lens, anchoring artistic and curatorial experiences of art practice and identity formations in terms of the political and entrepreneurial differences within China's 'one country, two systems' (OCTS) arrangement. It aims to create a new body of data on the topic of art and design practice across Greater China borders which includes considerations of the socio-economic impact which OCTS has upon the artist. The research outputs would include: an artists database on an online repository and scholarly written and spoken papers based on discussions held at the networking laboratories.

In order to fully probe the impact of OCTS across borders upon the cultural and economic practices of artists and Chinese curators, the network aims to integrate a range of academic, public sector and independent partners from the UK, Greater China and Singapore who have expertise and other experience on the subject, thus engaging with multiple approaches to the research as practice. This would work to benefit the breadth and quality of research concerning art and design in Greater China produced at each partner site, whilst producing collaborative findings. Including organisations which are public facing, the network aims to engage localised as well as international communities within the surrounding activities of the network in the locations of: Manchester (UK), Hong Kong (China) - Tainan (Taiwan), forming a networking body which would develop new possibilities for knowledge exchange.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research network will enhance understanding of the issues at stake for Chinese artists working in Greater China who have crossed borders temporarily or permanently between mainland China, Hong Kong and/or Taiwan or for those who tackle issues of border crossings within their work. The data collected constituting artist case studies, discussion laboratories and conference papers will work to highlight and evidence the social, cultural, political and economic issues faced by practising artists and curators who have migrated between mainland China and its islands as well as the ways in which these wider issues become manifested within the themes of the artists' and curators' bodies of work. For each laboratory, the partner venues will advertise the event via its website and/or blog and/or social media platform and via their mail listings, all of which work to target relevant audiences that include artists, academics, curators, gallery visitors and writers/publishers. It is expected that the networking events will be well attended and by a relevant audience. The potential benefits of assimilating such a networked knowledge exchange base may include:

- For artists: the opportunity to voice ideas, opinions and experiences, to display art work to the network members within the laboratories or symposium - with the option of uploading it to the MMU online repository - and the means to collaborate on future projects 

- For curators: the potential to collaborate, exchange ideas, gain knowledge for future exhibitions about Greater China or border issues via accessing the social media forums, the open access repository or by attending the laboratories and conference

- For independent, commercial, national galleries/museums: cross-institutional knowledge exchange and recognition with universities, greater avenues for promotion reaching more diverse audiences and a more multifarious stimulus for the creation of exhibitions and education programmes

- For Third Sector refugee organisations: access to case study data via the online repository (after the summative symposium) concerning Chinese practising artists' social, culturel and economic experiences of migration between the regions of Greater China

- For researchers: the opportunity to test research ideas, to disseminate knowledge across institutions, disciplines and sectors in a variety of forms, including through the potential curatorship of exhibitions, through the presentation of written and spoken scholarly papers and through the organisation of conferences and other events - all of which may constitute collaborative formats that draw from the new network.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-04-20</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-11-21</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>26572</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A solo show of Enoch Cheng's mixed media work which responded to the concept of Chinese borders.

It also enabled the cross fertilisation of ideas between academics, artists and other members of the public whom attended the exhibition preview as it coincided with the first day of the conference. As the exhibition was covered in Ming Pao Weekly magazine in Hong Kong, the outreach of the exhibition beyond academia has been greater than planned. 

As the summative conference was multidisciplinary and included a number of international artists, it is envisaged that some of the ideas and issues discussed may have impacted upon the artists' practices (beyond the arts-academic sphere). One artist, from the Netherlands, mentioned the VCB conference and project at an event in China, subsequently, and invited one of the other speakers to attend.

The CFCCA edited publication (in publication outputs), included a chapter that the P.I. wrote, which drew from the research and referenced it. The book is not with an academic press but is intended for a wider audience; it was launched in the CFCCA gallery and included a diverse range of speakers and audience members from the arts, creative industries, the design sector and the embassy.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>5A327518-3084-486D-9834-1B4E72F7CF1F</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56cb65cabb5487.30806416</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1) New collaborations:

The four research network laboratories, the summative conference and their surrounding site visits in Hong Kong and Taiwan encouraged multidisciplinary and cross-institutional discussion on the topic of Chinese Borders and visual culture. From these meetings, further, unexpected, extensive contacts with artists and scholars were developed, some of which have already instigated new collaborations. The investigators on the network invited a range of artists and scholars (for example, Professor Frank Vigneron and Sophie McIntyre) to the research laboratories, some of which, (for example, Morgan Wong) were featured in concurrent, relevant art exhibitions about borders, and some of whom have remained in contact with the Principal Investigator or whom submitted papers for the summative conference (5-6th April 2016). Furthermore, through the networks established during the project, a snowballing of new contacts has occurred. The P.I. has since had a meeting with relevant Hong Kong artists Sampson Wong (during his visit to Manchester) and Joshua Han (during a visit to Vancouver), where a future project has been discussed and is currently being visualised. 
- The established Hong Kong artist, Enoch Cheng, attended the Hong Kong lab and the summative conference, where the P.I. curated a solo exhibition of his work in MMU's Grosvenor Gallery, examining migration issues in Hong Kong (entitled INHERE) which coincided with the conference. This partnership was a significant addition to the research dissemination plans. The exhibition was reviewed in Hong Kong magazine - Ming Pao Weekly.
- Further to this, the P.I. and one of the investigators - Rachel Marsden - has begun to plan a larger scale exhibition on the same theme with the P.I., and one of the conference attendees.. Although the planned exhibition falls outside of the 17 month research network and aims to form part of a larger project, it will incorporate research findings from this project, applying a more focused, curatorial and artist-centred approach to the theme of Chinese border art. 

2) The development of Significant New Research Questions and Issues:

- What does 'border' mean for this research project? The issue that has arisen from the perspective of Hong Kong and Taiwanese researchers, curators and artists on the project has been that the border with the mainland is not substantial enough as a barrier. In Hong Kong, the media (and artists) have reported negatively on migration from the mainland. In Taiwan, which, unlike in HK, does not operate under 'one country two systems,' the researchers and artists who were present at the labs, stipulated their desire for complete (UN-recognised) sovereignty for Taiwan. With most 'border art' the border is viewed as an obstruction which does not enable the fluidity of cultural and social crossings. In the case of this research, it seems that the border symbolises a lack for artists in terms of the equality of agency amongst the people who live within the locations which the border demarcates geographically.
- The labs and exhibition field trips indicate that artworks and exhibitions which address the border/tension with mainland China can very broadly be categorised into four creative approaches, based on the art examples provided. There are:
1. 'Protest objects' (including banners, memes, appropriated tents, umbrellas and other objects) 
2. Socially engaged / collaborative practices in the form of projects which engage with ecology and local communities (including in 'border' regions)
3. 'Identity art' which explores 'HongKongeseness' or 'Taiwaneseness' through the exploration of 'nativist'/local/indigenous styles and techniques. 
4. Lens based media that capture the (hard) borders
Painting and mixed media artworks that explore the hard borders and/or that address the multiplex issues which arise from these borders.
- Differences between Art spaces between mainland China, HK and Taiwan. In all three cases there are commercial galleries and these are not always seen as distinguishable from 'independent' galleries. There is a significant appearance and closure of new galleries in the mainland and, to a lesser extent in Hong Kong. There is a concern in relation to the mainland that there is the investment capacity but not the cultural knowledge to fulfil the number of new art galleries that arise. 
- Censorship of artworks across the Chinese straits, including, recently, in Hong Kong. 
- There are other borders which have been acknowledged as being relevant to the project: rural to urban migration and the post-colonial border crossing between Hong Kong and Britain and Taiwan and Japan.
- Economic-political concerns. Anti-China sentiment can be seen in some HK work though China equates to Communism for some, so the viewpoint can be seen as anti-Communist. The mainland is also viewed as capitalist and too focused on property development/profit. Prices of property in HK have become, as a result, unattainable. Occupy Central (unlike other occupy movements) - as a criticism of the mainland - brings together social issues around the discontent of both 'Communist' political interference and capitalist economic interference within Hong Kong.
- (Artistic) symbols of border issues across the straits have been identified:
Taiwan: sunflowers (protest movement), references to indigenous communities
Hong Kong: yellow umbrellas, yellow/black protest signs, ribbons, post-it notes, tents, locusts (mainland Chinese migrants)
barbed wire and watchtowers (former military border between Hong Kong and Guangdong).

3) Significant Negative Findings:

- The project aims were too broad. It has not been possible to pay equal attention to all the research aims and to focus equally on Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. 
Most of the researchers and invited speakers at the labs focused on art from the perspective of the latter two regions.
More artists and exhibitions encountered have focused on art rather than design.
- Within the timescale it has not been possible to trace comprehensively a broad range of diaspora artists who have translocated across the straits. Relatedly, less than 10 artists responded to the survey call-out.
- The terms used in the project's title and aims could have been more closely defined from the outset to avoid potentially wasted discussion of key concepts, such as 'art' and 'border', or exploration of these definitions could have been written into the project aims. 
- The project's budget sometimes fell short in terms of maximising the dissemination of knowledge. There wasn't contingency funding to enable for international speakers who were not named on the funding proposal but whom were discovered or invited during the network's development to present and travel to the HK and Taiwan labs. In most cases, this did not deter new contributors from giving papers but it may have affected the professional appearance of the network. A contingency travel and speaker fee fund would be something worth considering on future project proposals.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>- The findings from the four laboratories was presented at the summative conference, alongside selected papers from researchers from beyond the network.
- Selected findings will be published (as outlined in the funding application) - in a co-edited book (in current discussion with Press, Feb 2017). It aims be the first book of its kind on the specific topic of the contemporary art of Chinese borders. Due to the pro-democracy/independence movements and protests which have emerged in Hong Kong and Taiwan since 2014, the findings will be topical and help to create a resource on the visual culture of these movements. As the topic set for the research network was very broad, the introduction to the publication can outline the range of topics broached from the project's outset, providing an overview of issues to consider in relation to art and borders in China. This would be useful for future researchers of the topic and could help eliminate unnecessary base research.
- There is a database made of artists' responses to questions about their experiences of Chinese borders in their work and of all artists mentioned in the research labs by speakers. This will be placed on MMU's online repository and so openly accessible to future researchers in academia and the Third Sector and curators interested in the topic (this is in process, February 2017)..
- The P.I. and one of the investigators have begun planning a group exhibition and range of events, which aims to open up debates around the 'Chinese century', protest cultures and socially engaged artistic practices to the public, and will include outreach educational workshops around the exhibition. 
- The research network now has an online presence through its associated blogs and university website links. It is planned that the network of researchers, artists and curators will remain in contact and that future curatorial and published collaborative outcomes may be instigated as a result. Furthermore, the web presence and summative conference may provide a broader catchment of relevant researchers and artists on the topic. The P.I. aims to develop the established research base and findings into a larger scale research project funding application.
- The keynote paper the P.I. gave at Goldmiths provided ideas, theories and information about the visualisation and artistic practices that have responded to border politics (drawing from the research). As many of the audience were MA students from Humanities disciplines, it is hoped that this provided a different, creative and interdisciplinary perspective on Border Studies, which PG students could potentially develop/ take forward into their research..</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>80807256-6590-4537-A8AD-5718A506A846</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56cb68d7265b02.45655215</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://visualisingchineseborders.wordpress.com</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C3AC739E-A41A-46B9-A24D-51F423398A4B</gtr:id><gtr:title>' 'What is Chineseness?' and Other Rhetorical Questions,' in CFCCA (ed.) 30 Years of Centre for Chinese Contemporary Art.</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2cb4f7f99ab12ad0e73212aa41803a01"><gtr:id>2cb4f7f99ab12ad0e73212aa41803a01</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kennedy B</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780957633254</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>58b1adb5765b80.00905956</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1A24B2FE-29F3-47E1-8BDE-09AD10FDA437</gtr:id><gtr:title>Border praxis: Negotiating and performing 'Hong Kongeseness' and 'Taiwaneseness' in contemporary, political 'Chinese' art practices</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Contemporary Chinese Art</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2cb4f7f99ab12ad0e73212aa41803a01"><gtr:id>2cb4f7f99ab12ad0e73212aa41803a01</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kennedy B</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58b1a50de095a6.93810772</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/L015757/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DB058E35-DBAD-4B21-B030-5C3C78825B11</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Area Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E99BA5DD-0B5B-41DF-9B99-594DE94BA768</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Art History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ABBA5192-0B16-4BC8-8B3F-3A48625872F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9E4BDAC2-CD51-4625-BCC1-5F768EE168D0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>51073B72-B972-4034-A0A1-87A6B0DCD198</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Museum &amp; Gallery Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A07E7F36-54E2-4C1B-95CF-20804AA94E26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pacific Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
