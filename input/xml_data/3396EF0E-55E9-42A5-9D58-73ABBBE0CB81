Given its distinctive stylistic and thematic profile, these surahs and passages - which I propose to call the &amp;quot;Medinan Qur'an&amp;quot; - are defensibly viewed as constituting a discrete stratum of the Islamic scripture. It includes the longest and most bewildering texts in the Qur'anic corpus (surahs 2-5 and 8-9) and also comprises a considerable number of putative Medinan insertions to earlier Qur'anic proclamations. 

The Medinan Qur'an occupies a key position in the formative history of Islam: It fundamentally shaped later Islamic convictions about the paradigmatic authority of Muhammad and thereby inspired the post-Qur'anic emergence and compilation of a multitude of reports about his extra-scriptural utterances and actions (the so-called hadith). The Medinan Qur'an also forms the ultimate inspiration for Islam's development into a religion with a strong focus on law. Finally, it is only in Medinan texts that we find Qur'anic injunctions to militancy and religiously motivated warfare as well as an explicit demarcation of Islam from Judaism and Christianity.

Despite the Medinan Qur'an's vital importance for the emergence of classical Islam, its scholarly analysis is still lagging behind. Are the long Medinan surahs merely agglomerations of self-contained paragraphs or do they constitute unified compositions? Can we reconstruct their literary emergence, including subsequent processes of revision and editing? What was the communal function or &amp;quot;setting in life&amp;quot; which Muhammad's Medinan proclamations originally served? How does the Medinan understanding of righteous behaviour, of Muhammad's prophetic and political authority, and of the nature of the Islamic community diverge from that of the earlier Meccan texts? To what extent is the stylistic, literary, and thematic shift that is visible between the Meccan and the Medinan layers of the Qur'an underpinned by the appropriation and transformation of pre-Qur'anic ideas, concepts, and modes of expression? To what extent, how, and why does the Medinan Qur'an, despite this shift, engage with and reinterpret the earlier Meccan material?

My research seeks to subject the Medinan parts of the Qur'an to a multi-dimensional and rigorous sequence of analytic steps. This will include an analysis of their compositional structure and their most important literary forms and phraseological conventions, the reconstruction of processes of textual expansion and revision, and the juxtaposition of Qur'anic passages and notions with possible Rabbinic and Christian parallels. Through my research on the Medinan Qur'an, which will be published as part of a comprehensive synthesis of the current state of historical-critical Qur'an scholarship, I shall showcase a rich and non-reductive way of studying the Islamic scripture in its historical context of origin which will provide a methodological paradigm for future contributions to the field. In parallel with my own work, I shall also launch a collaborative investigation into the Medinan Qur'an by a group of internationally renowned scholars. To this end, I shall convene a conference which will lead up to the production of an authoritative reference work. Finally, I shall undertake a range of additional activities aiming at a wider dissemination of my research both among the academic community and the general public.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>I aim to communicate my research to three audiences: 

(i) Secondary school students: I shall pioneer ways in which the study of the Qur'an as a historical and literary document can be taken into secondary schools. To that purpose, I shall make use of the well-established framework provided by Pembroke College's award-winning Access Programme, centred on an intensive extracurricular course for competitively selected students from schools with a low record of application to Russell Group universities. The workshops which I shall deliver for this programme will offer a group of A-grade state students a unique opportunity to engage with a discipline which they would not otherwise be likely to encounter at secondary school but which in many cases will be highly germane to their own cultural and confessional identity. In addition, my workshops will expose these students to an academic style of learning and raise their general awareness of academic 'niche' subjects like theology and non-European languages and cultures, applicants for which are still disproportionately drawn from the independent school sector.

(ii) The general public: During the part-time period of the fellowship (October 2016 - May 2017), I shall deliver a number of talks presenting my research results to a general public. These talks will take place both at high-end research libraries and at two of the hub schools participating in Pembroke's Access Programme. My impact activities will climax in the podcasting of at least four lectures with accompanying handouts. These podcasts will make aspects of my own research and that of my colleagues accessible to a national and international audience. In doing so, I shall inject much-needed background information about the Qur'an's origin, content, and literary organisation into public conversations about Islam and set myself up as a primary academic interlocutor - both for the general public but also for Muslim believers - on issues pertaining to the historical-critical study of the Islamic scripture.

(iii) Undergraduates: The monograph which will be one of my two written outputs will be characterised by a sober and example-based style of presentation that will make it suitable reading already for undergraduates in their third or fourth year of study, who will thus be inducted into the basic methods and current state of historical-critical Qur'an scholarship.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-04-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>135094</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>&quot;From Dietary Antinomianism to Dietary Prohibitions: A Chronological Reconstruction of the Emergence of the Qur'anic Food Taboos&quot;, invited lecture at the University of Edinburgh (School of Literatures, Languages and Cultures), 23/1/2017.</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>36F39C58-3371-4FDE-BFFB-58DADC2F2DC8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Academic lecture presenting aspects of my research to students and colleagues at Edinburgh.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b3576563e581.63304739</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>&quot;The Dual Qur'an&quot;, Somerville College Chapel, Oxford, 19/2/2017</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A9E7FA87-8056-4A6B-8179-69B3BA85C8EC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Talk drawing on my research that was delivered in the context of a Sunday-night chapel service.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b3554661e006.78763061</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Termcard-HT17.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>&quot;'We Have Sent it Down as an Arabic Recitation': What does a Qur'anic Word Mean, and How Do We Find Out?&quot;, London &amp;
