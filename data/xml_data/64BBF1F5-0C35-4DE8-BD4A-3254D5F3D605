INTEGRATING WALKABILITY MODELS INTO PRACTICE</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/J010588/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>The Knowledge Exchange, Spatial Analysis and Healthy Urban Environment (KESUE) project has extended previous work from a project that examined the health impacts of a regeenration schemes in Belfast (the Physical Activity in the Regenerationof Conswater, PARC project)&amp;nbsp; in order to develop evidence and policy tools that link features of the built environment with physical activity in the cities of Belfast and Derry-Londonderry in Northern Ireland. It has used this data to help shape policy decisions in areas such as physical activity, park management, public transport and planning.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Working with a range of local partners who part-funded the project (City Councils in Belfast and Derry-Londonderry, Public Health Agency, Belfast Healthy Cities and Department of Regional Development), this project has mapped all the footpaths in the two cities (covering 37 per cent of the NI population) and employed this to develop evidence used in strategies related to healthy urban planning. Using Geographic Information Systems (GIS), the footpath network has been used as a basis for a wide range of policy-relevant analyses including pedestrian accessibility to public facilities, site options for new infrastructure and assessing how vulnerable groups can access services such as pharmacies. Key outputs have been Accessibility Atlases and maps showing how walkability of the built environment varies across the two cities.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In addition to generating this useful data, the project included intense engagement with potential users of the research, which has led to its continued uptake in a number of policies and strategies, creating a virtuous circle of research, implementation and feedback. The project has proved so valuable to Belfast City Council that they have now taken on one of the researchers as a full-time employee. &lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project has been designed to maximise the impact of the research already undertaken on developing a model to assess the walkability of the built environment. The project builds on established partnerships and aims to create new collaborations. Initial discussions with our partners have identified a wide range of impacts on policy, decision-making, capacity building and awareness raising in relation to enhancing public bodies' understanding of the environmental correlates of physical activity. The project will increase the effectiveness of interventions in the built environment to support active lifestyles and help target resources in a more efficient way. It is also suggested that there may be a range of spin-off benefits for those involved in direct service delivery (e.g. the councils). The project links directly to a number of major policy initiatives in Northern Ireland and across the UK related to obesity, physical activity and active travel. 

The impacts can be considered in a number of phases. In the short term (months 1-12), the project will have immediate and direct impacts through training and knowledge transfer opportunities; in the medium term (years 2-3), the project is expected to influence broader policy and data-gathering approaches and in the long term (+3 years), we hope that the project will be shown to be the basis of an ongoing collaborative relationship between the University and stakeholders active in this policy field. 

Project impacts are maximised through a robust communication, dissemination and monitoring strategy. This will include a detailed needs and stakeholders analysis in the first few months of the project, regular steering group meetings to monitor how the walkability model has been used by each partner and a series of dissemination workshops in Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK that will describe the development of the methodology, the benefits and applicability of the model. The project also includes proposals for a number of peer reviewed papers and conference presentations.

Finally, the impacts strategy is built upon a strong record of engagement of the research team, who have extensive experience in such collaborative projects and in communicating with an array of government, business and civil society stakeholders in health and spatial planning.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>59992</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Belfast City Council</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Secondment of Research Assitant to Belfast City Council</gtr:description><gtr:id>81F37C66-C055-49BF-BA8D-3BD36060C36C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Input into council reports and stimulating other policy initiatives within the council</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56ddef1924a6f4.94159949-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Financial support for the research assistant</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Secondment of a research assistant employed on the KESUE project to provide technical assistance to the City Council</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentaiotn by Dr. Mark Tully on &quot;The KESUE Project: Developing Walkability Tools for Practice&quot;</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D2F2973D-4264-40E9-A359-9E09827C34B1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation at the 2013 UKCRC Public Health Research Centres of Excellence Annual Conference, Cardiff.

Outcomes are therefore a better description of what the project has achieved and these include: 



1. There is substantial value in developing footpath networks in UK cities as these significantly improve the accuracy of accessibility analyses. In the case of Belfast, the network is 75% more extensive than the default road network and has 557% more individual elements. Given that the greatest influence on physical activity appears to be the immediate vicinity (i.e. ten minutes walk) of the home, such improvements in accuracy could lead to far more robust research on environment-behaviour interactions.



2. The GIS platform of the RWN provides enhanced value as it allows pedestrian data to be combined with a range of other existing information. For example, it has been combined with data on land use and density to provide an assessment of overall walkability. It has also been combined with socio-economic and census data to help identify those groups that could differentially benefit from access improvements. There is potential for combining the network data with a range of other data sources (e.g. environmental health licensing of fast food outlets) to provide a range of powerful analyses that can make policy interventions more targeted and effective. The use of the tool has enabled, for the first time to orientate policies and services around the concept of walkability and pedestrian access allowing it to become a central criteria on a range of policy contexts.



3. There are, however, outstanding issue on how the data and model established by this project can be managed in the long-term to provide an ongoing and publicly-available resource, which is an area that we are continuing to work on with our project partners.

 

4. The development of the RWN was very time and resource intensive and may therefore not be replicable in every city. However, there are a growing number of data sources, including those held by Great Britain's Ordnance Survey and open access map data that is being released that would form a substantial basis for such a network. 



5. As a knowledge exchange project, KESUE has highlighted the great benefits that can be derived from extending and adapting university research projects into a policy-relevant resource. This appears to have been to mutual benefits to both external partners and the researchers themselves, who are now better placed to undertake impact-related research in the future. The project has also highlighted the value of close, integrated partnerships within healthy cities between knowledge producers, with knowledge users, such as local authorities and other statutory agencies. 



6. In addition to the policy-related outcomes, the project has facilitated a number of research insights that are being developed through papers for peer-reviewed journals and which contribute to our understanding of how best to measure connectivity in cities; the appropriate geographic scales for analysing built-environment-behaviour interactions; and the development of more accurate measures of walkability.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>See above. This project has established a GIS-enabled footpath network that has many potential routes for exploitation. It was designed as a policy-support tool for decisions in public health, transport and planning but through its initial use many other potential uses have been identified. For example it ahs been used to generate a walkability map of Belfast and Derry and is being used to support initiatives on Healthy Ageing and Park management in Belfast. 



Although it was designed primarily for a policy-tool, it also has potential commercial value as it is a more accurate reflection of pedestrian routes within Belfast and Derry-Londonderry and could therefore be of use within apps and data bases that require such locational data, such as transport models, public information and navigation aids.



The data also has potential use as a research tool as it enables a more accurate sampling of built environmental features for studies examining the links between the built environment and physical activity and will be used in this capacity by an inter-disciplinary team of researchers at Queen's University Belfast.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B89D2CD4-22D0-4040-8280-FBC2D9020167</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-197114264.7761053775d3aba</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Environment,Leisure Activities/ including Sports/ Recreation and Tourism,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.qub.ac.uk/research-centres/KnowledgeExchangeSpatialAnalysisandHealthyUrbanEnvironments/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>The findings of the KESUE project were referrred to in 'Making Life Better - A Whole System Framework for Public Health 2013-2023' where it was highlighted as an example of good practice</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0D073034-E9C2-48BC-87F4-5544A176464B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Improved public policy in relation to active travel and pedestrian based access t public services</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545f255dd09462.66522421</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.dhsspsni.gov.uk/making-life-better</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Presentation on 'Evidence on Healthy Urban Planning' to Northern Ireland's Assembly Regional Development Committee</gtr:description><gtr:id>C6D68041-6233-416E-A103-3955EBA896A3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Evidence given on the role of health and active travel in Northern Ireland's transport policy.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-4446390014.557531621f2aa8</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>The contract of one of the Research Assistants employed the KESUE project was extendned as part of a deployment to Belfast City Council in order to continue the work of the project within the council.</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A01BA297-8105-43B8-8F49-A2AB5C59B151</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The KESUE project led directly to increasing Belfast City Council capacity in GIS and analysis of public services using active travel.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545f27496e9bf1.55282837</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>The contract of one of the Research Assistants employed the KESUE project was extendned as part of a deployment to Belfast City Council in order to continue the work of the project within the council.</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0FB3A8BD-5C03-44B6-AC9B-12F615A6ABC1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The KESUE project led directly to increasing Belfast City Council capacity in GIS and analysis of public services using active travel.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545f2748ed3875.90884066</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1155169C-E1B5-49E3-9B24-337BB27777EC</gtr:id><gtr:title>A comparison of road- and footpath-based walkability indices and their associations with active travel</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Transport &amp;
