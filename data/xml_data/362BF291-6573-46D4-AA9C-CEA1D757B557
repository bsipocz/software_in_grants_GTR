It will do this through a secondary analysis of a number of large-scale, quantitative datasets, including the Labour Force Survey, the Family Resources Survey, the Childcare and Early Years Providers Survey, and the Childcare and Early Years Survey of Parents. The aim of this research is to inform understandings of the future shape of childcare provision and usage in Britain.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The specific objectives are to:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>examine childcare usage in the Britain, including combinations of formal and informal care, and how the use of care is related to the demographic characteristics of families&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>examine who provides informal childcare, their demographic characteristics and the extent to which they have other caring responsibilities&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>examine the formal childcare workforce - such as nursery nurses, playgroup workers and childminders - including their demographic characteristics, their qualifications and their work patterns.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Collaboration with the NDNA and the Daycare Trust will ensure the research is of value to non-academics.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Key non-academic beneficiaries include policy makers from a range of government departments (e.g. the DH, DfE, DWP), early years' practitioners and childcare charities, such as the Daycare Trust and the National Day Nursery Association (NDNA). We have agreed collaboration from the NDNA and the Daycare Trust and will work directly with them to achieve a wide breadth of communication of the research findings. To ensure the research maximizes its impact, Claire Schofield, Director of Membership, Policy and Communications at the NDNA, has agreed to draw out the key implications of the research for NDNA's members (which will be posted for free on their website) and a summary of key policy messages to circulate to policy makers. The former summary will be the basis of a presentation we have been invited to give to the NDNA annual conference. Additionally, Jill Rutter, Policy and Research Officer at the Daycare Trust, will assist us with developing a summary for parents.

We have agreed input from a variety of key stakeholders: Claire Schofield, at the NDNA, Valerie Christian, at the DWP, Neil Leitch from the Pre-School Learning Alliance, Sarah Wellard from Grandparents Plus, Celia Hannon at the Family and Parenting Institute and Professor Dick Wiggins, Director of Methodology in the Centre for Longitudinal Studies at the Institute of Education. They will be involved in the research through a stakeholder/advisory group. Communication with this group will begin within the first month or so of the start of the project, in order that the groups' views of the research can be incorporated into the planning of the research. The group will then meet two-thirds of the way through the research, when the substantive part of the analysis has been completed, and then towards the end of the research, when the key findings have been written up. This will enable the group to discuss and evaluate the research findings at the key stages.

The medium to long term impact of the research will be to provide policy makers and practitioners with a picture of how childcare usage and provision has changed over time. This will help inform understandings of the future shape and nature of childcare provision in the UK. It will also help inform policies concerned with children's general well-being. Additionally, the findings will illuminate the characteristics of people working formally and informally in the early years' workforce, which will help inform where to target recruitment drives. 

These impact outcomes of will be achieved through the planned communication and dissemination activities, such as presentations to the annual British Educational Research Conference (BERA), the European Early Childhood Research Association (EECRA) annual conference and NDNA annual conference for early years' providers. Also, through publishing in practitioner journals / magazines, such as 'Nursery World' - the UK's leading professional journal for early years' professionals working in community settings. Summaries of the key research findings will be produced collaboratively with NDNA and disseminated to the organisations centrally concerned with the early years' workforce and childcare usage and provision. In order to ensure that the findings leave a legacy, it is anticipated that dissemination will continue beyond the timeline for this research. Part of this will be to seek to present our findings to the 'All-Party Parliamentary Group on Childcare'.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>131747</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Pre-school Learning Alliance</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Preschool Learning Alliance collaboration</gtr:description><gtr:id>8DDB7E99-CE49-4888-A46D-172B9E1EDCD0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Along with the National Day Nurseries Association (NDNA), and the Family and Childcare Trust, the Preschool Learning Alliance using our research as evidence to campaign for a better qualified workforce especially related to the 30 free childcare hours pledge.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>561e29b96a5bd6.92849621-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The Preschool Learning Alliance were an active member of our project advisory group.

Visitors to the website are invited to leave comments. The website has been 'live' since July 2015 and we are planning to keep it 'live' for at least another couple of years, adding in more materials as they become available.

Policy - we delivered a briefing focused on key recommendations for taking the research forward for DWP on 20th November 2015 to Helen Stephenson (then Director of Early Years, Child Poverty, and Children's Services Strategy Children's Service and Departmental Strategy Directorate), and two senior researchers in the 'Early Years and Childcare Analysis' unit (which is in charge of the two main DfE surveys: Childcare and Early Years Survey of Parents and the Childcare and Early Years Providers Survey). In advance of this briefing we liaised with our Advisory Group (including a member from the DfE government department) to agree content which would be most useful to their work. The session was very well received and DfE gave us very positive feedback. As a result of meeting with us to discuss the implication of our results for the DfE they advised us:
? They would carry out their own internal review of the classification of childcare workers in the Labour Force Survey (LFS), and that if they agreed with our findings, they would feed this back to the Office of National Statistics to support our own letter to the ONS (see below) calling for changes to be made to the Standard Occupational Classification system.
? They acknowledged and agreed with our findings of the lack of data on childcare preferences and would be supportive of further research in the area to encourage better understanding of what parents want alongside patterns of childcare usage.
? They were interested in our conclusion that delivery of future services needs to bear in mind flexibility for parents, especially those working a-typical hours. We have since seen evidence of a recognition of the need for greater flexibility in the Childcare Act of 2016, regarding how the increase in universal free childcare provision will be delivered.
? Our findings on low workforce pay would inform a new workforce strategy due in September 2016. Since then they have informed us that this research has &amp;quot;particularly raised awareness of the SOC coding issues and we recognise that this is a limitation when we're analysing the LFS and other data (such as ASHE [ONS Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings]) which will inform our own future analysis of these datasets and the workforce&amp;quot;. (13/06/2016).

We submitted a letter to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) outlining possible adjustments that they might like to consider making to the Social Occupational Classification System to improve the information that can currently be obtained about the childcare workforce using the Labour force Survey. We were informed that this letter was of great value to the ONS's open consultation review of the SOC which took place in Spring-Summer 2016 - the results of which are due sometime in August 2016.

As a direct result of the work carried out for this project, we were invited among a small pool of researchers in the field to apply to carry out a small piece of research to help the Department of Education better understand the role of childminders in delivering the free childcare offer. We were successfully awarded this research and carried it out between May-June 2016.

NGOs - Disseminating findings of the project to stakeholders was one of our priorities from the beginning, which resulted in an active Advisory Group as well as a number of practitioner-focused dissemination events we organised (see other outputs on Researchfish for details.) Below is what some of the stakeholders told us about our research and how useful it was to them in their work.

Jill Rutter, Head of Research at the Family and Childcare Trust said she cited our work was invaluable in her work producing recommendations for 'Creating an anti-poverty childcare system' (funded by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation for their programme of research on tackling issues related to poverty) and she cited our research within their 2016 publication: 'In for a pound. The relationship between staff wages and Ofsted grades in group-based childcare provision': http://cdn.basw.co.uk/upload/basw_93434-6.pdf (see page 6).

The Professional Association for Childcare and the Early Years (PACEY) have also cited our research in various publication campaigning for better workforce pay, including this recent report: 'Towards an Early Years Workforce Development Strategy for England' https://www.pacey.org.uk/working-in-childcare/workforce-development-policy-briefing-jan16.pdf (see pages 2 and 8).

The National Day Nurseries Association (NDNA) was a collaborator in the project and represented on the Advisory Group. They have told us that &amp;quot;the Provision and Use of Pre-School Childcare in Britain project has been beneficial in providing evidence to help NDNA inform the policy agenda on the childcare workforce. We used evidence from the report when engaging with policy makers and in our submissions to public consultations, including our submissions to the Low Pay Commission's consultation on the National Minimum and National Living Wage and the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee Inquiry into Free Entitlement to Early Education. Evidence from the study was used in our media work to make the case for reform of education funding to allow greater investment in the childcare workforce and a workforce strategy. The government has announced that it will develop a childcare workforce strategy and committed to reforms to childcare funding ahead of expanding the entitlement for free childcare to 30 hours per week for working parents of three and four-year-olds.&amp;quot; (19/06/2016).

The Preschool Learning Alliance was represented on the Advisory Group. Neil Leitch, director, told us: &amp;quot;This work on the impact of low pay and conditions in the childcare sector has helped inform the debate on the need for adequate early years funding, a central part of the Alliance's lobbying and campaigning work over recent years. We have also cited this research in discussions on the reasons for the low numbers of male practitioners in the childcare sector, and I cited the UCL study directly in a speech on the issue of men in childcare in February 2016. The research has also highlighted the potential challenges to recruitment in the sector going forward, another key focus of the Alliance ahead of the roll-out of the 30 hour offer, and has helped inform discussions with peers and government around the current recruitment crisis in the sector.&amp;quot; (17/06/2016).

Academics - we have received a number of enquiries from academics about our research, including e.g. Dr Barbara Da Roit, University of Amsterdam, Department of Sociology, who contacted us to obtain some further information about the ethnic breakdown of the childcare workforce. Although we hadn't published this material, we were able to supply her with some information on this for a paper she is writing.
Antonia Simon was recently invited to co-author a chapter, 'Driving towards a united early childhood workforce? Common heritage and touchstone issues in workforce development in New Zealand and England' for a global policy handbook on early years.

We carried out a major dissemination event in July 2015 to raise awareness of the need for a better paid workforce. We are continuing to highlight the importance of this message by writing a blog and regularly tweeting on the subject, which have been used in turn by others to campaign for better policies for childcare for families in Britain.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>1B8B89E6-B146-4A40-942C-67660C839C21</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d728605af4f2.82467605</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1. Recent policy drives have been to increase the access to good quality, affordable childcare. Quality has been linked to qualifications of the childcare workforce. While we identified that qualification levels of the workforce are modestly rising (a 12 per cent increase between 2005 and 2014 in NVQ level 3+ qualifications in the Labour Force Survey) suggesting policy initiatives are working, we found pay remains very low compared to other occupations (average pay is only 10 pence above the minimum wage level). This is a concern because low pay risks childcare workers leaving the sector which could lead to children not being looked after as well as parents have the right to expect. It also raises concerns about who will do the caring in the future.

2. We found parents of preschool children use multiple forms of childcare and use differed according to family circumstances (e.g. informal childcare used more by younger mothers; formal childcare by higher income families). We identified a dearth of data from the perspective of providers of informal childcare for pre-school children. More data is needed that captures the characteristics of those providing informal childcare for preschool children, including their work patterns and the extent to which these carers are providing work to others (such as elderly parents). There is also a lack of data about parental preferences for formal and informal childcare. These important gaps in current knowledge hinder understandings of the future shape of childcare provision and usage in Britain.

3. Collaborating with the National Day Nurseries Association (NDNA), and the Family and Childcare Trust, had a significant impact on the research direction and the reach of the key findings. Both organisations were instrumental in the design and write up of the key findings and contributed to the study's dissemination events and even hosted an event for us (at the NDNA). A key outcome of this collaboration was to jointly submit with the NDNA a letter to the Office for the National Statistics suggesting areas for improving their classification of the childcare workforce which we expect to directly change the way these workers are counted and classified in national statistics in the future. The collaboration with these organisations also meant the outputs were directly relevant to the users of the research.

4. An important but unexpected finding from this research was that more people describe themselves as working as childminders in the Labour Force Survey (LFS) than are registered with Ofsted as childminders. In 2014 Ofsted reported a total of 53,000 childminders, whilst the LFS estimated over 100,000. This difference could indicate a body of unregistered (illegal) childminding, but it could also be a result of the variation in the way 'childminders' are defined between the two sources. For example, the LFS childminder category includes 'related occupations', such as nannies and au-pairs who are not required to register with Ofsted, and there is no reliable estimate of their numbers. However, the size of difference in estimates between the two data sources makes this unlikely.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>There are a number of ways our research is being taken forward, including:

1. The National Day Nurseries Association (NDNA), the Family and Childcare Trust and the Preschool Learning Alliance using our research as evidence to campaign for a better qualified workforce especially related to the 30 free childcare hours pledge.

2. Impact generation through submitting with the NDNA a letter to the Office for the National Statistics to work with them to improve their future classification of the childcare workforce using the Standard Occupational Classification System.

3. Encouraging dialogue between groups attending our recent key findings dissemination event on 24 July to take forward the key messages, particularly about low pay and the viability of the government's 30 free childcare hours offer, but also how the workforce should be defined and grouped in the future.

4. Encouraging people to 'keep the conversation going' through the #childcareinbritain hashtag on Twitter and our project microsite: https://www.ucl.ac.uk/childcareinbritain .

5. Having meetings with the DfE and DWP to discuss how to take forward the key research messages in their future planning for childcare provision and usage.
