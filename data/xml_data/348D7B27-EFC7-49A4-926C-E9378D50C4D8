a three-year research programme led by the Centre for Longitudinal Studies (CLS) that will seek to improve our understanding of the intergenerational transmission of economic and health inequalities in the UK. The programme will use rich data from the four CLS-managed cohort studies that form a core part of the UK's portfolio of world-renowned longitudinal studies: the 1958 National Child Development Study (NCDS), the 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70), the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) and Next Steps (formerly the Longitudinal Study of Young People in England). In bringing together the leading academics responsible for these studies, the programme of research described below will exploit CLS's unique experience in designing longitudinal surveys, its in-depth knowledge of each of the data sets, and the Centre's insight into UK public policy issues. 
The programme, which will also involve expert external collaborators and visiting scholars from other countries, is designed to enhance the work of CLS as an ESRC resource centre. It will deepen our understanding of two overarching themes 1) Healthy lifestyles across the life course, and 2) Processes and consequences of social mobility. The programme will focus on cross-cohort comparisons, policy-relevant topics, cutting-edge empirical methodologies, and inter-disciplinary collaboration. Each theme will comprise a set of inter-related research projects. The 'Healthy Lifestyles' strand will cover: intergenerational influences on physical activity; parental work and the rising prevalence of obesity across generations; childhood mental health trajectories and lifetime consequences; alcohol use across the life course and its links with health and wellbeing. The 'Social Mobility' strand will cover: parents' wealth in childhood and its relationship with children's development; the mechanisms and consequences of social mobility; the influences on and outcomes of educational and occupational aspirations of children and young people.
The programme will capitalise on the new data collections of the MCS and LSYPE, planned for 2015. This will maximise the return from prior ESRC investments, and ensure the relevance and timeliness of findings for policymakers and practitioners. The analyses will also benefit from the comprehensive data collected from cohort members born in 1958 and 1970 through childhood and into adult life. Coupled with the detailed data available on cohort members' parents, these studies are uniquely placed to shed new light on intergenerational transmission of advantages and disadvantages.
We have a carefully considered strategy for making sure that evidence from the research programme is fully exploited by a wide range of users. Seminars and conferences will be organised to share the results of analyses. The well-established CLS website (with approximately 25,000 unique users per month) will be augmented to showcase the programme's outputs, including publications, presentations and case studies. Media coverage of the cohort studies has proven to be an effective way of reaching many target audiences, including policymakers, practitioners, third sector organisations, and the general public. CLS will issue press releases on new publications and findings from the programme, and will further extend its use of social media to promote this research. 
CLS recognises the importance of ensuring that the cohort studies have maximum instrumental, conceptual and capacity-building impact. The proposed programme therefore focuses on issues that are central to promoting health and wellbeing across all sections of society. Research findings will be discussed with practitioners and policymakers, thus feeding through to public policy debate. We will also monitor, record and publicise the impact of the research to inform researchers and funders, and demonstrate to cohort members that the studies they are involved in are making a vital contribution to society.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research programme?

Policymakers - As discussed in the Pathways to Impact, findings from the proposed research programme will have direct relevance to a range of policy issues. CLS has extensive experience of successfully raising awareness of cohort study findings among policymakers, primarily through its media and events work. Focusing on central government and devolved administrations - but also local government and parliament - CLS will continue to improve the accessibility of both the data and findings for these beneficiaries.

Practitioners
Findings from the research programme will be useful to practitioners, their regulators, and their professional associations. In particular the proposed programme of research will be directly relevant to those working in health education and public health. 

The Third Sector
The two main strands of the research on Healthy Lifestyles and Social Mobility are likely to be of specific interest to organisations within the third sector and the provision of funding for secondments to CLS to work on the cohort data will help build capacity in this sector as well as strengthening links between CLS and external bodies.

General public
As a publicly-funded resource centre, CLS has a duty to make its work transparent and accessible to the general public. However, CLS also has the potential to improve public understanding of social, economic and health issues. Findings from the proposed research will be relevant to issues in everyday life, such as parenting, physical and mental health. It should also be noted that the general public includes cohort members and their families. Public outreach, such as press coverage of the studies, will contribute to boosting cohort members' engagement.

Media
Successful engagement with international, national, regional and local press is an important mechanism for reaching a wide audience including each of the groups described above. More information on our media work can be found in the Pathways to Impact section.

Data users
As described in the Case for Support, an important output of the research programme will be well-documented derived variables describing longitudinal trajectories (e.g. of alcohol use and of physical activity). These will augment the high quality data resources already provided by CLS. The primary beneficiaries of this work will be other data users across sectors, career stages, disciplines and countries. 

Wider research community
CLS holds considerable substantive, methodological and professional expertise. In the proposed programme of research we will take a systematic approach to important statistical issues such as unmeasured confounding, measurement error and attrition, and in so doing our published work will provide guidance to other users - particularly those early in their careers and those using other longitudinal resources - to dealing with these issues in their own research.

How will they benefit from the Research programme?

The CLS Research programme will benefit the groups listed above in several ways:
- relevant and timely packaging of findings for policy development and practice guidance, for example, briefing documents and events, and social media
- easier access to published works using cohort data, for example through the CLS online bibliography and the working paper series
- accessible and engaging information on social, economic and health issues, for example through web news items, press releases, social media, and briefing papers
- high-quality, well-documented data resources for research
- opportunities for secondments and visiting fellowships
- training and capacity building support for those analysing data, including students, early career researchers, Government analysts and those from the third sector</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-12-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1517647</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Camden Council</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Intergenerational influences on Physical Activity - London Sport, Camden Council and Islington Council; Childhood Mental Health - Camden Council and Islington Council; Curricula, Schools and Social Mobility - Department for Business, Skills and Innovation, Universities UK and The Sutton Trust</gtr:description><gtr:id>1AD1AF8D-2C37-4F7F-A819-928DE48BE686</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Impact partners have agreed to the collaboration.

The 20th century witnessed significant improvements in health in most countries including substantial increases in survival to older ages and large reductions in late age mortality. The continuing rise in life expectancy is undoubtedly one of the great successes of public health, but has also raised the question of how healthily the gained years of life will be spent. We use data from UK's birth cohorts, other longitudinal studies and repeated cross sectional surveys to investigate competing theories of the joint progress of health and mortality. Sullivan's method and regression based approaches were employed exploiting their different underlying assumptions to empirically test the compression, expansion and dynamic equilibrium of morbidity hypotheses. We found evidence for expansion of morbidity in the working age population, whereas a more complex pattern emerged in the older population, indicating a structural break between generations. The opportunities and challenges of employing longitudinal and life course studies to empirically test competing theories of ageing and practical implications for the study of potential mechanisms that underlie the joint progress of health and mortality will be discussed.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b85f22b081e4.89585788</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Symposium, &quot;Do curriculum differences generate educational inequalities? held 19th  September 2016 @ UCL IoE.</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1D4CC0B8-4DA7-4410-9DD7-E01A1937E6B3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We invite you to develop a paper for a forthcoming Special Issue of the Oxford Review of Education on the topic of subject choice.

There was considerable discussion afterwards and from this I made many contacts. The abstract follows: This study investigates whether Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual (LGB) young adults are more at risk of bullying than their heterosexual peers using Next Steps, a nationally representative longitudinal dataset from England. The experiences of more than 7,200 young adults from across England who were born in 1989-90 are examined. At age 20, the young adults were asked about their sexual identity and whether they had been bullied in the previous 12 months and during secondary school. The findings show that young LGB adults had a 52 per cent chance of having been bullied in the past year at age 20, compared to a 38 per cent chance for their heterosexual peers, after taking into account other characteristics that may make someone more likely to be targeted, such as gender, ethnicity, disability, or family socioeconomic background. The situation had improved slightly since their school years. Between the ages of 14 and 16, young people who later went on to identify as LGB had a 56 per cent chance of having been bullied in the past year, compared to a 45 per cent chance for their heterosexual peers. Moreover LGB young people were at considerably greater risk of being bullied frequently - that is, once or more every fortnight - during secondary school. LGB young people were found to be more than twice as likely as their heterosexual classmates to be regularly physically bullied and excluded from social groups. This paper also examines the association between being bullied and life satisfaction: the findings show that by the time they reached age 20, young LGB adults were less likely than their heterosexual peers to report being &amp;quot;very satisfied&amp;quot; with how their lives had turned out so far. However, all young adults - regardless of sexual identity - were less likely to be very satisfied with their lives if they had been bullied. In summary, although all people are less likely to be bullied as they get older, young LGB adults remain at higher risk than their peers. These findings suggest that in order to tackle the problem, anti-bullying interventions cannot be focused only at schools and their pupils. Policymakers, employers, further education institutions and others working with young adults need to do just as much in order to challenge discrimination at all ages.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b7ddb36246e0.61272244</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.aera.net/Events-Meetings</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Cross Cohort Research Project Social Mobility Individual Projects</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0C84FC8B-C66C-41AD-BC53-42B7064D61E7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Not aware of any impact.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56b9c879b56ac7.86031904</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.cls.ioe.ac.uk/page.aspx?&amp;sitesectionid=2369&amp;sitesectiontitle=Social+Mobility%3a+Cross+Cohort+Research+Programme</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Cross Cohort Research Project main webpage which details the two Research Strands.</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>23E3B75D-CDF5-4A7D-843A-0270F03EE3B3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Not aware of any impacts.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56b9b1b5d1baf8.75041953</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.cls.ioe.ac.uk/page.aspx?&amp;sitesectionid=1358&amp;sitesectiontitle=CLS+Cross-Cohort+Research+Programme+(CCRP)+</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Symposium: The determinants of subject choice and its role in determining future academic pathways, SLLS Bamberg</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>04ACED8C-3D88-4322-94C3-147CC6DBC011</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Description of symposium (up to 300 words)
The importance of the subjects that young people study while at school for their future academic pathways has increasingly attracted the attention of policymakers. Most notably this has manifested itself in the UK Government's introduction of the English Baccalaureate school performance measure at age 16 and their introduction of a school performance measure based on the Russell Group's list of &amp;quot;facilitating subjects&amp;quot; at age 18. The interest from policymakers has sparked greater attention from researchers, who recognise that understanding subject choice at age 14 is important because without doing so we do not have the knowledge to help young people make the choices that will help them to achieve their future plans. This symposium will present new evidence on the determinants of subject choice, extending this from traditional predictors such as pupils' gender and SES, to consider non-cognitive traits and the importance of peer groups. It also considers the consequences of subject choice, specifically highlighting their role in influencing post-16 transitions and whether individuals remain on an academic focused track. By bringing together both the backward- and forward-facing aspects of this subject choice research this symposium will allow presenters and attendees to engage with this important topic in a holistic manner.

PAPER 1 (abstract up to 300 words, including name and affiliation of presenter and any co-authors)
The role of schools in explaining individuals' subject choice at age 14
Jake Anders, UCL Institute of Education (with Morag Henderson and Alice Sullivan)

Young people's subject choices at age 14 may have important consequences for future academic and labour market outcomes. However, the choices that individuals face are shaped by the schools in which they find themselves at this point in time. This paper explores the important question of the extent to which individuals' decisions are affected by the school they attend and to what extent this changes when we also consider the composition of their schools in terms of academic attainment and socioeconomic background. This is achieved using multi-level variance decomposition models applied to both survey and administrative data on the subjects young people study between ages 14 and 16, separately testing the robustness of the results to population-level data and to rich background data on individuals. We highlight the important role schools play in many subject choice decisions, but also how school's decisions are in turn affected by their composition.

How does the choice of A-level subjects vary with students' socio-economic status in English state schools?
Catherine Dilnot, Oxford Brookes University and UCL Institute of Education

The reasons why students from lower socio-economic groups are under-represented at highly selective universities are not entirely understood, but evidence suggests that part of the gap may be a consequence of differential choice of A-levels by social background. The Russell Group of universities has since 2011 published guidance on subject choices, describing some A-levels as 'facilitating' in that their choice keeps the largest number of Russell Group degree courses open to potential applicants. This study uses National Pupil Database data from three recent cohorts of English state school students taking at least three A-levels, and a taxonomy of all 96 A-levels certified for English students in 2014/15. Large differentials in subject choice by social background are found, particularly for facilitating subjects but also for subjects considered 'less suitable' by Russell Group universities. Multilevel linear probability models show that much of the difference is accounted for by the characteristics of schools and colleges attended by students from different social backgrounds and by prior attainment, although a small but significant relationship of subject choice with social background remains. This suggests that there is an important role for appropriate subject choice guidance at age 16+, which is a particular challenge if students are changing school.

The role of non-cognitive traits in socio-economic disparities in subject choices at university
Natasha Codiroli-McMaster, UCL Institute of Education

This paper considers the underlying drivers to socio-economic disparities in subject choices at university, with a focus on the psychological processes involved in these choices. Firstly, I consider whether differences in students' perception of ability in, and enjoyment of STEM subjects can account for disparities in choices. Secondly, I consider whether these non-cognitive factors interact with social background, to further understand whether the psychological processes that underlie subject choice differ by students' background. I use representative survey data, Next Steps (previously the LSYPE), and regression methods to identify the unique associations between students' enjoyment of subjects, and their perception of ability, with subject choice at university. With prior academic attainment accounted for, I find significant interactions between students' family background, enjoyment of STEM subjects at the start of secondary school, and choice of subjects at university. Students whose parents do not have a degree and who enjoy maths and science are more likely to study social sciences, business and law at university over STEM subjects, than those whose parents have degrees. I will discuss findings in relation to sociological and economic theory, and explore possible policy implications.

The school curriculum and post-16 transitions
Vanessa Moulton, UCL Institute of Education (with Jake Anders, Morag Henderson &amp;amp; Alice Sullivan)

The British school system provides a curriculum to 14-16 year olds which is highly differentiated, both within and between schools. This paper considers whether the subjects a pupil has taken in the 14-16 phase influence post-16 transitions, taking into account prior academic attainment, and if so, whether this accounts for socio-economic differences in access to post-16 education. We consider post-16 progression to the following outcomes: 1. Full time education or training; 2: The college-track curriculum (A levels); 3: A level subjects which have been identified as highly valued by elite universities ('facilitating' subjects). We address these questions using 'Next Steps', a study of 16,000 people born in England in 1989-90, linked to administrative education records (the National Pupil Database).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b806ec664e01.06092261</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.slls.org.uk/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Social Justice Expert Steering Group, Department for Work and Pensions (8th December)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>468E9044-0FB9-4247-8B61-2373B0054687</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I took part in this day of discussion about the research output using the cohort studies related to Social Justice.

In the first half of this seminar Dr. Morag Henderson will look at Subject Choices at 14. Does the school curriculum generate educational inequalities? This paper reports on initial findings from a major ESRC project on social mobility. We identify patterns of subject and qualification choices made at age 14. This topic is particularly important for England as the school curriculum encourages specialisation at a relatively early age compared with other European countries. This curriculum differentiation is typically framed in terms of 'choice', but in practice young people's choices are constrained by their schools. In addition, adolescents are likely to lack the information needed to foresee the long-term consequences of options taken as young as age 14. Yet most past research on 'subject choice' has focused on the 
later stages of educational trajectories, particularly Higher Education. The choices made at early branching points can limit pupils' subsequent options, potentially contributing to educational inequalities. 

We examine the roles of social class, parental education, income, gender and ethnicity in determining these curriculum clusters. We also examine the role of the intersections of these variables, for example, the different role of gender for working and middle class 
youth. Using measures of prior attainment at 7 and eleven, we address the question of whether curriculum differentials simply reflect differences in prior attainment or whether they actually exacerbate inequalities.

This would be considered a non-controversial response. The intuitive assumption when considering subjective wellbeing and psychological distress is that factors associated with one are associated with the other - albeit in the opposite direction. But what if we're wrong? What if wellbeing and mental illness, or happy and sad, are not two sides of the same mental health coin?

In this blog for World Mental Health Day, Dr Praveetha Patalay examines the factors that influence children's mental illness and wellbeing using the Millennium Cohort Study. The blog appeared on the What Works for Wellbeing blog, and was cross-posted to the IOE London blog and the CLS website.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c9543971a131.04075646</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://whatworkswellbeing.org/2016/10/10/childrens-mental-wellbeing-and-ill-health-not-two-sides-of-the-same-coin/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Cross Cohort Research Project Healthy Lifestyles Individual projects</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>452E678D-9EB4-447E-BBB7-F04315222325</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Not aware of any impacts.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56b9c7ed28c486.11842093</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.cls.ioe.ac.uk/page.aspx?&amp;sitesectionid=2367&amp;sitesectiontitle=Healthy+lifestyles%3a+Cross+Cohort+Research+Programme+</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Social Epidemiology Workshop (Antigua, Guatemala, November 2015)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3C1B061D-29D1-43E6-988A-8BDA8C7F4AD7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A poster under the Intergenerational Influences on Physical Activity was presented to the Society for Longitudinal and Life Course Studies conference in July 2015.

In this paper we identify patterns of subject and qualification choices made at age 14. Most past research on 'subject choice' has focussed on the later stages of educational trajectories, particularly Higher Education. However, the choices made at early branching points can limit pupils' subsequent options, potentially contributing to educational inequalities. This paper identifies the patterns of General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) subjects chosen by a cohort of young people born in 1989/1990. We make use of the Next Steps data (formerly the Longitudinal Study of Young People in England (LSYPE)) which is linked to the National Pupil Database. We develop an approach to measuring the academic selectivity of subjects and qualifications. We examine the roles of social class, parental education, income, gender and ethnicity in determining participation in these curriculum groupings. We also examine the role of the intersections of these variables, for example, the different role of gender for working and middle class youth. Using measures of prior attainment measured at age thirteen, we address the question of whether curriculum differentials simply reflect differences in prior attainment or whether they actually exacerbate inequalities.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56bdd0213598d6.33381863</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation at meetings of American Society of Criminology by R Bucci &amp; J Staff, titled Variation in early childhood alcohol use by parental substance use</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>759DE1AF-8B31-4306-9801-30349920A67E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Academic presentation at national scientific meeting of American criminologists.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>588b8d0f6c6bb3.51311150</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1) We observed differences in psychological distress between the 1958 (NCDS) and 1970 (BCS70) cohorts at age 42 years. Men and women born in 1970 report more psychological distress symptoms than those born in 1958, but the observed differences were more pronounced in men, with the magnitude of the year of birth effect being almost twice as strong compared with women. The observed increase in the levels of psychological distress experienced by people in mid-life in Britain has major policy implications, given that the increase has occurred despite economic growth. The 1958 cohort is part of the 'lucky generation' of post-war baby boomers, who experienced high absolute levels of social mobility, and lower levels of social inequality in their early lives, whereas the 1970 cohort are part of 'Generation X', who have experienced greater uncertainty and insecurity over the whole of their adult lives and a more individualistic ideological climate (Sullivan et al. 2015). If these generational changes lie behind the increase in psychological distress, then we would predict that future generations will be worse off still if such trends were to continue

2) Correlates of children's mental illness and wellbeing are largely distinct, stressing the importance of considering these concepts separately and avoiding their conflation. This study highlights the relevance of these findings for understanding social gradients in mental health through the life course and the conceptualization and development of mental illness and wellbeing in childhood as precursors to lifelong development in these domains. The predictors of the two domains of mental health, in terms of their salience and the amount of variance that they explain, indicate that, for wellbeing, the wider environment and social relationships are very important at this age. Of note, school connectedness, being bullied, friendships, and perceptions of safe neighborhood were strongly correlated with wellbeing. Conversely, these variables did not significantly predict mental ill-health, which was associated with arguing with parents, peer problems, chronic illness, communication difficulties, special educational needs, and parent mental health. Overall variance explained indicates that the ecosystems theory-based predictors included in these models predict almost half the variance in mental illness and just over a quarter of the variance in wellbeing. The present analyses also highlight the relevance of examining predictors as part of a framework and systematically considering the role of covariates in models. To illustrate this point, existing studies have investigated the associations between parental education and child's mental health18 and find that higher parental education is associated with lower mental illness. In the present study, once the model accounted for parental income and child's cognitive ability, parents' educational level ceased to be significantly associated with their child's mental health.

3) We found beneficial relations between elite education during schooling and university, with subsequent self-rated health and health-related behaviours in midlife. Private school and higher-status university attendance were related to better self-rated health, lower BMI and multiple favourable health behaviours in midlife. Findings suggest that type or status of education may be an important under-researched construct to consider when documenting and understanding socioeconomic inequalities in health. They add to studies demonstrating inequalities in health outcomes according to educational attainment and to studies examining how aspects of schooling or university education are related to a more limited number of health outcomes. By not accounting for the type or status of education, and focusing solely on attainment, it is possible that existing epidemiological studies have underestimated differences in health attributable to education.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>These findings will be useful to practitioners, their regulators, and their professional associations.
