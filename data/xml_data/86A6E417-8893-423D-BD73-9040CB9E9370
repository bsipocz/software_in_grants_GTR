This heterogeneity partly reflects variability in the types of DNA damage or mutation carried within each cell and also the type of cell which carries the mutation. Importantly, only some cancer cells, known as cancer stem cells, are able to propagate disease relapse in patients. Our research is focused on the biology of these cancer stem cells. Our group is applying single cell analysis and state of the art genetic modelling, to better understand the cancer stem cells in certain types of blood cancer. Using patient samples, we will analyse cancer stem cells at a single cell level to understand exactly which cells might be responsible for causing relapse in patients and how they might be better detected and eradicated. Through application of these state of the art cell and molecular biology techniques in both humans and model systems, these studies will provide a substantial contribution to the understanding of blood cancer stem cells and the findings will highlight the clinical applicability of single cell technology across cancer biology.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The major focus of our research programme is towards the identification and genetic modelling of leukaemic and pre-leukaemic stem cells in myeloid malignancies. Our aim is to characterise the cellular and molecular biology of these key populations of cells which are capable of propagating disease relapse in patients, in order to understand how these cells might be more effectively identified, targeted and eradicated. To achieve this, our research programme is focused on understanding the normal cellular origin of leukaemic stem cells, and to thereby identify the perturbed molecular pathways which result in the generation of preleukaemic clones, and eventually malignant transformation. There are 3 related approaches in this regard:

1. The development of genetically engineered leukaemia models to study the impact of specific mutation(s) on the establishment, evolution and propagation of leukaemic stem cells. For example, through modelling of the haematopoietic impact of leukaemia-associated Flt3 mutations during the development of acute myeloid leukaemia.
2. The study of leukaemia stem cells in patients with myeloid malignancies throughout their disease course, in order to understand the impact of novel targeted therapies and the cellular origins of clonal evolution, resistance to therapy and transformation to more aggressive forms of disease. These studies necessitate state of the art single-cell whole-transcriptome genomic analysis, a technique which has been established by our group. This technique will be applied to normal blood stem/progenitor cells in order to definitively reconstruct the haematopoietic hierarchy. This will provide the foundation for analysis of single blood cancer stem cells to better understand their origin and evolution.

3. To understand the clinical and biological consequences of germline genetic abnormalities in humans which predispose to the development of myeloid malignancies later in life.

Importantly, whilst these studies are specific to myeloid malignancies, as this is the area of clinical medicine in which AJM specialises, the findings of these studies will also be more broadly applicable across cancer biology. For example, the development of single cell genomics approaches to investigate cancer stem cells has clear potential to facilitate the translation of this pioneering technology through to patient benefit through better detection of minimal residual disease and targeting of therapy-resistant cancer stem cells.

In parallel, AJM has developed an extensive clinical research portfolio, delivering new treatments to patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms in the Thames Valley (and beyond), and also providing invaluable sample biobanks to help support the above translational research programme.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>673000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Celgene</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>The Genetic Landscape in Transfusion Dependent Myelofibrosis</gtr:description><gtr:id>701317E2-321F-45BB-B555-E39CEE465BB1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>AJM is a newly established group leader and MRC Senior Clinical Fellow in the WIMM working in the field of myeloid malignancies. The intention for initiating this collaboration is to generate substantial information with regards to the genomic architecture in myelofibrosis that will result in a strong publication. Thus, it would be expected that AJM would &amp;quot;own&amp;quot; the genomic data arising from this research and will have the right to publish these data following an appropriate review period by Celgene.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cc3ef224c682.63170157-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Samples are available from 250 patients with high/intermediate risk myelofibrosis enrolled on a phase III trial of pomalidomide (2:1 randomisation pomalidomide:placebo). All samples will be analysed by targeted resequencing using a gene panel developed in our institution (TruSeq? target enrichment kit) followed by sequencing using MiSeq. This assay will require minimum of 1?g gDNA using PicoGreen quantification. The panel will include all the genes listed above. For this project it is important that deep coverage is obtained to gain insights into clonal architecture and evolution in myelofibrosis patients during response to pomalidomide therapy, during prolonged follow-up, and at the point of any disease progression events. Thus, we will aim to achieve 100x coverage for each of the above gene targets. Any patients not carrying any of the above mutations (likely to be a small minority (&amp;lt;5%) will be subject to exome sequencing. 
Using algorithms well established in Oxford by the computational biology research group housed at the WIMM (http://www.molbiol.ox.ac.uk/CBRG_home.shtml) we will carry out state of the art bioinformatics analysis to identify likely somatic driver mutations in this large cohort. Through the interaction with Celgene, these data will be correlated with the robust clinical information collected as part of the trial to understand the relationship between somatic mutations, clinical characteristics and response to pomalidomide. For such a large and well annotated cohort of patients with carefully defined transfusion dependent myelofibrosis, this will also provide unique insights into genetic heterogeneity in this disorder and the relationship to clinical phenotype and disease course. Recurrent, previously undescribed mutations predicted to be functionally relevant will all be validated using sanger sequencing and tracked through serial samples.
Importantly, we are also well placed in the HSCB laboratory to follow-up findings from the sequencing with biological studies to understand how any novel candidate genes/pathways might modulate response to pomalidomide. In addition to state of the art cell culture and molecular platforms, we also have a number of highly relevant mouse models available (JAK2 V617F conditional knock-in, EZH2 conditional knockout) providing powerful platforms for understanding the in vivo consequence of different mutations for development of anaemia and response to pomalidomide. Any candidate genes will initially be studied in cell lines by lentiviral transduction of the relevant mutation or shRNA mediated knockdown if genes are inactivated/deleted to understand if the candidate gene(s) affects the response to pomalidomide in vitro. Once validated in cell lines, candidate genes will be further studied using the above in vivo models, including in vivo treatment of mice with pomalidomide, to understand how different mutations may interact to modulate response to this treatment. Finally, using our extensive cell bank of samples from patients with myelofibrosis, we will then validate possible candidate genes using human myelofibrosis patient samples using either lentiviral transduction as above or by using targeted agents if available, both with and without pomalidomide treatment.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>This is a research collaboration with Celgene. Detail of the original research proposal are below. This research is currently underway and still active.

Myelofibrosis is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous BCR-ABL-negative myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) with reported mutations in a number of genes primarily affecting signalling pathways, epigenetic regulators and splicing machinery e.g. JAK2, CALR, MPL, TET2, ASXL1, EZH2, DNMT3A, IDH1/2, CBL, IKZF1, U2AF1, CHEK2, TP53, SF3B1, SRSF2 and LNK.1-3 The most frequent reported genetic event is a gain of function recurrent mutation in JAK2 (V617F) causing constitutive activation of the kinase with consequent activation of downstream signalling. Furthermore, many patients show activation of the JAK2 signalling pathway in the absence of the JAK2 mutation, likely caused by mutations indirectly activating the JAK2 pathway e.g. MPL. Recently, somatic mutation of CALR has been reported in MPN patients without the JAK2V617F mutation.4,5 These mutations are mutually exclusive of JAK2V617F and MPL mutations, suggesting that they might activate similar pathways. 
Severe anaemia with RBC-transfusion-dependence is common in patients with advanced MPN-associated myelofibrosis. The above signalling pathway mutations are associated with high as well as low blood counts and rather mutations affecting splicing (SRSF2) and epigenetic regulation (ASXL1) are associated with development of anaemia in myelofibrosis. Pomalidomide, an immune-modulating drug with pleiotrophic bone marrow effects, resulted in improvements in the level of anaemia in several phase 2 studies, however, preliminary results in a phase 3 study are disappointing. Nevertheless, in this phase 3 study, 16% of patients showed an anaemia response (16% also in placebo arm) and 22% a platelet response suggesting that some response does occur in a subgroup of patients. There also were some possible differences in clinical parameters between patients achieving transfusion independence on placebo versus pomalidomide. Together, these findings suggest that a there might be a subgroup of transfusion-dependent or thrombocytopenic patients who would benefit from pomalidomide therapy, although this subgroup is relatively small and lost within the context of heterogeneous patients included in this large phase 3 trial. With the advent of next generation sequencing and personalised medicine it is possible that molecular features might better define a subgroup of patients predicted to respond to pomalidomide.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Oxford</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>The Oxford SIngle Cell Consortium</gtr:description><gtr:id>CABD38DE-6402-4BB2-A007-C0F7530B7489</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Oxford Single Cell Consortium was established in 2014 followed by successful application for MRC CRI funding (&amp;pound;5 million) led by Professors Doug Higgs and Kay Davies, I am a coauthor on this grant application.

Limitations in our ability to study the biology of individual cells has historically been a major obstacle, inhibiting our understanding of some fundamental problems in biomedical research such as the onset of cancer, the immunological determination of 'self', and the ability to purify tissue-specific stem cells. Recent developments in the field of single cell genomics is now opening up unprecedented opportunities to uncover individual cell differences within such complex tissues. The objective of the proposed research is to establish a Centre of Single Cell Biology (CSCB) in Oxford that will take advantage of this pioneering technology in order to improve the diagnosis, stratification and treatment of a wide variety of human diseases. The CSCB will be coordinated by the Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine (WIMM) which has a long-standing technical and strategic expertise in single cell research. The capital development will be used to enhance single-cell research capabilities across the campus in a number of key areas:

Data analysis: Single cell genomics studies generate an enormous amount of data, with consequent challenges for the analysis and correct interpretation of these complex data sets. We propose to establish an entirely new research group devoted to the development of novel approaches for the statistical and computational analysis of single cell biology data and its application to medicine. This group will be located in new space to be developed at the WIMM, but jointly led by leading scientists across the campus. This new initiative will provide a clear pathway to integrate multidisciplinary, scientific and technical innovation in single cell biology research across the Oxford University Campus and to provide ground-breaking applications of this approach to medicine in the UK.

State of the art facilities: We will develop single cell biology research laboratories to allow practical access for research groups conducting these studies across the campus. These facilities will house cutting edge technology platforms and, importantly, will create &amp;quot;ultra clean&amp;quot; environments to carry out single cell experiments. This is necessary as very low levels of background &amp;quot;contamination&amp;quot; make the interpretation of single cell experiments challenging. 

Projects: As a specific example of how this technology will be applied to address fundamental problems in human disease, the lead programme of research in the CSCB will be focused on inherited disorders of red blood cells. These disorders are amongst the most common of all human genetic diseases worldwide with an estimated 300,000 affected babies born each year and a total number of affected UK patients of ~16,000. Currently, severely affected individuals are treated with supportive care, including lifelong blood transfusion and treatment to prevent accumulation of iron in the body, which is costly, burdensome, and gives rise to serious, long-term clinical complications. Here we propose to &amp;quot;genetically repair&amp;quot; the damaged genes in the patient's own blood stem cells. Single cell biology will be central to this project: First, single cell genomic approaches will be used to identify the blood stem cells which are the best target for this therapy. Second, single-cell analysis will be used to assess the safety and efficiency of this approach. This programme, focussed on developing an entirely new approach to treating the haemoglobinopathies, has the potential to transform the treatment of all human genetic diseases that can be cured by stem cell transplantation. This is one example of many projects in development across the campus which will be greatly facilitated by the development of improved single cell research capabilities.

2. To determine the CML-CSC burden in patients with suboptimal response to imatinib and in patients on 1st or 2nd line nilotinib therapy
3. To further characterise the biology of these residual CML-CSCs functionally and at the molecular level throughout the course of the disease in a series of patients on imatinib and nilotinib to:
a. Compare and contrast mechanisms mediating resistance of CML-CSCs to imatinib and 1st or 2nd line nilotinib
b. To understand whether 2nd line nilotinib can effectively eradicate residual CML-CSCs in imatinib suboptimal responders
c. Most importantly, to directly compare the biology of normal stem cells with CML-CSCs in patients on imatinib and 1st or 2nd line nilotinib to understand how these cells might be selectively targeted with novel agents.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>This is an educational award from Novartis UK (approx &amp;pound;250K) for a research project focused on leukaemia stem cells in patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia and how these might be better eradicated. Details of the research proposal are below:

Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is a stem-cell driven chronic leukaemia propagated by a population of therapy-resistant cancer stem cells (CSCs) that, over time, are capable of causing disease relapse and progression, making this an ideal disease for the study of the cellular and molecular biology of CSCs. Current evidence supports that imatinib does not effectively eradicate CML-CSCs. The high proportion of patients in cytogenetic remission on imatinib therapy allows for ready availability of biological material for the study of these therapy-resistant CML-CSCs. It is perhaps surprising, therefore, that the phenotype and, in particular, the biology of CML-CSCs remains poorly characterized. Whilst second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as nilotinib have shown considerable efficacy in CML, with a higher frequency of deeper molecular remissions than seen with imatinib, the optimal indication and timing of a change in therapy to second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as nilotinib also remains unclear. Furthermore, whether patients in complete molecular remission can safely discontinue nilotinib is largely dependent on the presence or absence of residual CML-CSCs. Thus, understanding the response of the CML-CSC population to first or second line nilotinib therapy in pre-clinical studies is a key hurdle to help inform strategies towards the &amp;quot;path to cure&amp;quot; of patients with CML.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>MPN Advances</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BC91055F-2AC9-4438-9EC0-73DA1E51D01C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I regularly talk at the national myeloproliferative neoplasms patients and carers day, updating patients about scientific advances in the field.
