The energy trilemma presents many complex interconnected challenges which reach beyond the UK and have huge relevance internationally. These challenges vary considerably from region to region. Cultural differences also significantly affect what could be deemed as appropriate energy networks provision.
Current energy networks research does not fully embrace a whole systems approach and is therefore not developing a deep enough understanding of the interconnected and interdependent nature of energy network infrastructure. Although energy networks research is a rich and diverse area full of exciting research questions it is not attracting enough new researchers to work in this space.
Existing research into the future capabilities needed for our energy networks tend to focus on the physical hardware and, to a lesser extent, software and the digital/ICT elements which enable our energy networks to become &amp;quot;smart&amp;quot;. However, my understanding of energy networks is broad and incorporates many elements such as; People, Communities and Organisations, Digital/ICT, Physical hardware, Software and Control Systems, Policy and Markets
My vision would be to help create a vibrant, well connected, diverse, open, communicative energy networks community that has a deeper understanding of whole systems approaches to energy networks. I would strive to make this community open to new entrants, be representative in terms of equality and diversity, have well developed succession plans to ensure longevity and involve both established and emerging areas of research excellence. I would seek to strike the right balance between being inclusive but also focussed on the relevant questions, whilst being complementary and integrative with respect to other investments nationally and internationally in the energy networks space. I see the role of leading the energy networks hub as one of connecting, convening, facilitating, steering and communicating in order to help all stakeholders reach their potential and exploit all their chosen opportunities. In that sense I would see myself as stepping back from competing for further funding in this area to avoid conflicts of interest.
I have taken the bold approach to clearly identify a team of research staff who are highly capable of supporting me during the 6-month engagement period. I wish the 6-month programme of work to be delivered in an inclusive and transparent way. 
The engagement which I and the project team plan to undertake is done with the motives of:
- Deeper involvement by stakeholders
- Broadening the base of responsibility for outcomes
- Enabling community involvement, to create higher levels of trust
In this instance, the community is the range of academic, business, policy maker, international, third sector parties and the public, which I plan to engage with. I have therefore, in considering appropriate engagement methods, considered the intentions or motives of the participants and tried to ensure that these motives are addressed. Concurrently, I wish to utilise a method which co-creates the work programme for the Supergen Hub in a collective and inclusive manner.
I envisage my role to be one of enabler and leader of the Hub. I am ready to develop the skills of the management team at an early stage of the Hub so that there is career development and succession planning, to enable me to step back and take a more strategic role within the energy community. I expect the management team of consortium partners to include ECRs, and underrepresented groups including females and BME. I expect the management team to include leadership and management skills, and experience of EPSRC, EU and international research project management.
The management team shall be jointly responsible for the development and delivery of E&amp;amp;D targets, and development of appropriate E&amp;amp;D policy.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>I have been working in energy networks in Industry and academia for 20 years. I believe I have developed the necessary skills to carry out internationally leading research and to engender a culture of excellence. My research career has given me the necessary credibility and insights to do this in a large integrated School of Engineering. I am an internationally recognised researcher in the area of Energy Systems and Smart Grids. I have published well over 100 peer reviewed papers and won more than &amp;pound;25m as PI from research councils, Industry and the EC. 
I am an ideal candidate for this role as I have an excellent depth of knowledge in research, technical, and whole energy systems coupled with exemplary leadership, strategic and communication skills. I believe we are at a crucial stage in energy networks: the energy community has grown and matured and is ready; the challenges are acute and urgent; Industry is receptive and enabled to engage; Governments are ready to listen and shape policy with Industry and academia. I am eager to take on this role as an agent of change during this exciting period of energy transition. 
I would seek greater impact through driving further integration and alignment of funding mechanisms across the TRL levels (e.g. RCUK and Innovate UK). This will enable research questions to be co-created with society, industry and governments and taken from foundation to translation more frequently, rapidly and effectively.
I passionately believe in being open, transparent and collaborative and have seen this produce great results throughout my career, and therefore strongly advocate the Supergen leader as envisaged by EPSRC/RCUK. I strongly believe in inter-disciplinarity and have been working closely with academics in Anthropology, Human Geography, Economics, Statistics, Geology , Computing Sciences etc. in energy networks for many years now. A mutual respect and understanding for each other's disciplines is crucial but often missing and this oftenhinders the success of hubs of this kind. I have invested time to understand and respect these other disciplines, for example through the Customer-Led Network Revolution project. This gives me significant legitimacy and authenticity to run a hub of this nature in an effective and truly inclusive way. I understand that this is a challenging role and I will bring to the role a strong level of resilience and determination as well as being open, consultative and approachable.
