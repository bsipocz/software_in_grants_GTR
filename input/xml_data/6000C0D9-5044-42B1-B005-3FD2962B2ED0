This project aims to significantly advance knowledge about this hugely under-researched textile. For example, Clifford Gulvin's The Tweedmakers, which was the last major academic publication on the history of tweed, was written nearly forty years ago and there is a strong need to re-interpret this textile using more up-to-date methods. Furthermore, this project will be the first to examine the history of factory-produced tweeds in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. The researcher has been studying tweed since 2001, work that has primarily focused on the late nineteenth century. This Fellowship will substantially further develop and extend this inter-disciplinary investigation. The international dissemination of the research will primarily be through a major book, titled Tweed, to be published by Berg Publishers.This publication will explore the history of tweed including its manufacture, design and consumption from its emergence in the 1820s to the present. The project will be the first to consider in depth the crucially important inter-connections between the histories of different types of tweed, from craft-produced Harris tweeds, to factory-produced ones from the British mainland. The research will focus primarily on British contexts, but given the importance of exports to this industry, it will also examine the international consumption of tweed. For example, exuberantly coloured tweeds designed by Bernat Klein and made in the Scottish Borders were widely used by French couturiers in the 1960s. This project will also further develop previous research on the inter-relationships of tweed with major social and cultural changes in terms of class, gender and local and national identities in the late nineteenth century. For example, in that era tweed was strongly coded as masculine and the project will explore whether changing gender relationships have continued to play an important role in the design and consumption of these textiles. A previous innovative article by the researcher has shown the important physical and conceptual links of tweed with place or landscape and with changing ideas about British, Scottish, and English identities in the late nineteenth century. This research will be extended to examine the hitherto unexplored relationships between fashion textiles and urban and rural landscapes in the eras of late modernity and post-modernity. Tweed is often associated in contemporary media with Britishness, Englishness, heritage and tradition. Furthermore, the interpretation of tweed by leading fashion designers, such as Mary Quant and Vivienne Westwood, has focused on a fascination with its supposedly 'traditional' character. This study seeks to explore and explain how these connotations relate to the history of this textile and why they have such a strong contemporary resonance. The project also addresses the broader objective of aiming to develop and encourage new interdisciplinary approaches to the study of wool textiles. Through its focus on the design and consumption of tweed, it seeks to raise alternative questions to the existing research on British wool textiles, which focuses almost exclusively on taking economic history approaches to the English trade before 1830. The scarcity of published research on tweed means that the book will mainly draw on original sources, most of which have not been previously published. For example, this will include the Ceemo Tweed and Bernat Klein Collections held by National Museums Scotland. It will also involve interviews with individuals linked to the contemporary tweed industry. The research will also be disseminated through a partnership with Scottish Borders Council Museum and Gallery Service, which will involve collaborating on the development of an exhibition and associated education events.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This Fellowship project addresses an accessible topic that is of interest beyond the academic research community. Tweed is widely worn internationally and it remains an integral part of the British fashion identity. The project aims to significantly alter current knowledge about the history of tweed and to disseminate that research as widely as possible. Given the lack of competing titles, the book Tweed is likely to become the new standard text on the subject. This comprehensive and well-illustrated text will be of relevance as a source of visual and textual information. The project is likely to benefit professionals and students linked to the media and fashion and textile industries, both in the UK and internationally. In particular, it will help to stimulate innovation by raising awareness about the contemporary tweed industry amongst practising designers. It will also help to improve the quality of information disseminated about tweed in various contexts, including through the commercial and media sectors, thus benefiting the tweed industry and wider public.

The project addresses a topic that is highly significant to the local heritage of specific parts of Britain, most particularly the Scottish Borders region and the Outer Hebrides. Despite major decline in the tweed industries in these locales, the surviving firms are still of economic and social importance to these rural areas and to the UK. For example, employment in the Harris Tweed industry is important in helping to stem de-population from the remote Outer Hebrides. The project will therefore be of benefit to the local communities in these areas both socially,culturally and economically, as it will produce a new framework of understanding about tweed both past and present. Contemporary tweed producers export the vast majority of their cloths, including selling to high-profile fashion houses such as Chanel, Yves St Laurent and Prada. This design input of British mills to international fashion is usually anonymous and unacknowledged. Through its research on the tweed industry of today, this project will help to raise the international public profile of this important but fragile industry. Furthermore, previous discussions with the Chief Executive of the Harris Tweed Authority, have identified that heritage is very important to the Harris Tweed industry and brand. The project therefore has excellent potential to stimulate mutually beneficial dialogue between the applicant and industry figures about the history of tweed and how it is marketed today. 

The project will also be of benefit to the museum and archive sectors, as given the prevalence of tweed it features in many collections, both in the UK and internationally. The increased understanding about tweed generated by this project will help to improve the interpretion of these objects for the public. More specifically, the project research will assist staff at Scottish Borders Museums working on a small exhibition on Borders tweeds for 2013 and the associated education programme, as the applicant will deliver talks and input expertise based on her research. These events will provide educational and inspiring experiences for members of the general public, including senior school students. They will also involve an exchange of knowledge and ideas between local museum staff and audiences and the national museum-based researcher.The book Tweed is also likely to appeal to a wider public interested in textiles, fashion, gender, history and British identity. Members of the public who visit the proposed exhibition on Bernat Klein to be held at NMS in 2013/14 will also benefit from the project research as it will enhance the quality of the initial display concepts. 

The Fellowship project would establish the applicant as the leading international expert on the history of tweed. It will further develop expertise that will be available as an ongoing public resource through the applicants post at NMS.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-12-19</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-03-20</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>52886</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The Border Tweed exhibition was an outcome of the partnership between National Museums Scotland and the Scottish Borders Museum Service.

The AHRC Fellow, Fiona Anderson acted as Consultant for the display. The exhibition narrative related to some of the research questions addressed in the wider Tweed: History, Culture and Design project. For example, it explored the origins and naming of tweed, key aspects of its design, production and consumption and the historic links of this textile with the Scottish Borders region in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. It also looked at tweed as a fashion and sporting textile in both men's and women's dress. Furthermore, the display featured a section that focused on the design, manufacturing and international export of tweeds from the Scottish Borders region today.</gtr:description><gtr:id>E7EBE83A-8051-4CA7-AB11-F91C97290875</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The exhibition was visited by 3,000 people. Feedback from SBMS indicates that the display was popular with individuals who had formerly worked in the tweed industry, many of whom spent a long time in the exhibition reminiscing. It included contemporary tweeds produced by Scottish Borders manufacturers, thus raising public awareness about their work and international export success. It also featured objects on loan from the Archive of Heriot Watt University and it therefore provided wider public access to these artefacts. The Fellow was interviewed about the exhibition for the ITV, 'One Show'. This provided further public access to her research and also helped to raise public awareness about contemporary tweed manufacturing.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545b8bbd748393.90176650</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Border Tweed</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Scottish Borders Museum and Gallery Service</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Tweed, NMS and SBMS</gtr:description><gtr:id>F87391D1-E241-4664-BAA5-B5E56513C44A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This partnership resulted in the Border Tweed exhibition and the two talks, 'Tweed: Fashioned in the Borders' and 'Tweed in Contemporary Fashion' as described in detail in other sections.The collaboration was not multi-disciplinary.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545b98c12236b3.56410311-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The dialogue with Sinclair and Colton about the Border Tweed exhibition, actively contributed to the development of my research through knowledge exchange about relevant artefacts and archival documents in the collections of the SBMS and other local archives. These discussions also added to my existing awareness about developments in the contemporary tweed industry. The partners also helped to facilitate further useful knowledge exchange with other external contacts, including the Curator of Abbotsford, Matthew Withey. The collaboration with SBMS also helped with the dissemination of the research, by giving access to their regional networks of contacts in education and the wider community. These established relationships helped substantially with securing event bookings from senior schools distributed throughout the Scottish Borders region. In addition to curating the exhibition, SBMS staff organised and promoted the two talks and provided free access to their lecture theatre and audio visual equipment.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The AHRC Fellow, Fiona Anderson acted as Consultant for the Border Tweed exhibition, which was an outcome of the partnership. It was held at the Borders Textile Towerhouse in Hawick between 1st November 2013 and 22nd March 2014 and it was curated by Shona Sinclair and Fiona Colton of SBMS. My role principally involved sharing aspects of the project research and associated expertise about the history of tweed with the two Curators through a series of meetings. I also commented on the display text in consultation with the Curators. This dialogue fed into the development of the exhibition concepts and content and it therefore subsequently led to aspects of the research being disseminated to the public through the final display. The scant amount of published research on tweed meant that my expertise was particularly valued by the SBMS Curators. I also contributed to the promotion of the exhibition by being interviewed for the ITV, 'One Show'. My role in the partnership also involved preparing and delivering two talks that were part of the education programme of the Border Tweed exhibition.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Tweed in Contemporary Fashion</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2E27AE36-FECF-4876-AD10-10FF56DB2B27</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I delivered a lecture based on my research on the contemporary tweed industry within international contexts, at an event that was part of the education programme for the Border Tweed exhibition. This event was organised by Shona Sinclair of the Scottish Borders Museum Service, as one of the partnership activities of the Tweed: History, Culture and Design project. The talk took place at the Tower Mill, Heart of Hawick in the Scottish Borders on the 5th of December 2013 and it was attended by local senior school children. My lecture was followed by a talk from Ruth Duff, a young designer who works for the Hawick-based tweed manufacturers, the Lovat Mill. She discussed her education, chosen career route and the job she does today. The two talks were designed to raise awareness amongst young people about career possibilities in the local textiles industry. They inspired questions from and discussion with the school pupils. This event was successful in attracting bookings from around the Scottish Borders region of sixty five attendees from local schools. A press release was produced in order to promote the Border Tweed exhibition and the associated education programme. In addition, information about the event was included on the SBMS website.

Discussion with pupils showed that the event had raised awareness about career possibilities in the local textiles industry. I subsequently received interest from Heriot Watt University in a follow-up talk, which shows the ongoing impact of the event.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-2974096530.092970cbd8e32</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Tweed: Fashioned in the Borders</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>90B4D4B5-84D7-495D-8B5A-3BE585903456</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I delivered a lecture based on my AHRC-funded research at an event that was part of the education programme for the Border Tweed exhibition. In the talk, I examined new evidence about the origins, naming and early history of tweed. Innovative, primary research about the inter-connections between the contemporary tweed industries of the Scottish Borders and the Outer Hebrides was also explored in an accessible way. This lecture to 30 members of the public took place in the Borders Textile Towerhouse in Hawick, Scottish Borders on the 4th of December 2013. It was also attended by individuals who currently work,or who have previously been employed in the local wool textiles industry. The talk inspired questions from and discussion with the audience. A press release was produced in order to promote the Border Tweed exhibition and the associated education programme. In addition, information about the event was included on the SBMS website.



Feedback that the talk provided enjoyment and stimulated new thinking was received from a range of individuals including Alan Cumming, Design Director at the Lovat Mill and from a previous employee of the Woollen Industries Research Association.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-7585839636.2381430cc08fba</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The project has addressed a topic that is highly significant to the local heritage of specific parts of Britain, most particularly the Scottish Borders region and the Outer Hebrides. Despite major decline in the tweed industries in these locales, the surviving firms are still of economic and social benefit to these rural areas and to the UK. The partnership with SBMS helped to ensure that the dissemination of the research through the Border Tweed exhibition and associated talks was specifically targeted at the local community of the Scottish Borders, thus enhancing the level of impact. Owing to the large gaps in the published research, the sharing of the Fellow's expertise was particularly helpful to the Curators at SBMS and the project research significantly enhanced the quality of interpretation in the exhibition. The fact that the lectures had impact with the desired audiences is shown by the fact that positive feedback was received from individuals who were, or who had been, employed in the local tweed industry. My research has been the first academic study to explore the fact that the manufacturing of tweed in Britain has undergone dramatic decline, but continues to exist as small-scale, niche manufacturing of high quality cloths, mainly for international export. I have also identified that surviving firms in areas such as the Scottish Borders have difficulties with attracting new recruits because public perceptions about the future of their industry are often negative. The event for senior school students was successful in addressing these contexts, by providing positive and informative learning opportunities about the continued international success of a small number of local firms. 

The original application stated that the project research would contribute to the initial ideas development of an exhibition on Bernat Klein to be held in 2013/14. This display will not now form part of the displays programme of National Museums Scotland. In 2015, the Fellow's research about this Collection was published in the essay 'Bernat Klein: Colouring the Interior' in the book British Design: Tradition and Modernity After 1948 (Bloomsbury Publishers). My research about the Bernat Klein Collection is also publicly accessible via the Tweed book and through the permanent display of this designer's work in the Fashion and Style gallery at National Museums Scotland, which opened in 2016. It is envisaged that the Fellow's expertise about this Collection will continue to be publicly disseminated through other future publishing and public engagement activities. The project research also informed the overall concept for the Fashion and Style gallery, which mirrors the approach taken in the book Tweed by exploring the whole fashion cycle, including textiles. Impact was also enhanced through media interviews undertaken by the Fellow. Press coverage has included articles in Het Financieele Dagblad, the Netherlands equivalent of the Financial Times, the Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail and a feature about tweed on the ITV, 'One Show'. I was also interviewed by a journalist writing a promotional, web article for Harris Tweed Hebrides. These activities have helped to encourage public awareness in the UK and internationally, about contemporary British tweed manufacturing. In addition, they have helped to enhance the media profile of firms, such as Harris Tweed Hebrides, who have a notable impact on vital employment opportunities on the island of Lewis. The oral history research carried out on HTH and other firms and the subsequent media interviews reveal that the project has fostered mutually beneficial knowledge exchange and ongoing relationships between the researcher and industry. A further example of how the Fellow's knowledge about tweed was available as a public resource through her post at NMS, is the fact that she shared her expertise with the organiser of an international project, titled 'The Hebrides' being developed by the Norwegian artist, Knut Asdam.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>2DB806DF-4E54-4BC4-9D75-7FF5F89433BC</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545ba4e994b463.81535249</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The Fellowship has generated a significant new body of knowledge about the history and wider social and cultural significance of tweed between the late 1820s and 2013. The project has greatly extended and updated the published research, by exploring for the first time, the inter-connected histories of a range of different types of tweeds, including those made by craft and factory methods in different locations in Britain, including mainland Scotland, the Outer Hebrides, Yorkshire and the West of England. A significant contribution has been made to developing new, interdisciplinary approaches to the research of British wool textiles from 1830 onwards, a field that has been seriously under-researched and dominated by economic history methods. The project has embraced design, production and consumption perspectives, which has provided new insights into the social, economic and cultural meanings associated with a highly popular group of textiles. The book Tweed is the first academic publication to explore the history of British tweeds within their international contexts, in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. 

Contemporary research has involved a series of oral history interviews and knowledge exchange with individuals from British firms that make tweeds. This research has revealed that these companies continue to be successful in fiercely competitive, global luxury markets, through designing cloths that are desirable to companies such as Chanel and Ralph Lauren. Studying trade journals along with these interviews, has revealed the significance of tradition, or heritage and innovation to the design, production, marketing and export of British tweeds. The design input of British mills to international fashion is a particular form of creative practice, which is about global inter-connections and dialogue and a distinct sense of national or local identity.

The research has also significantly advanced knowledge about the shifting relationships between tweed and gender, which have hitherto only been researched in relation to the 1860 to 1914 period, primarily in relation to femininity. This investigation has shown that because tweed was worn by both men and women, it has great potential to yield insights into the creation and expression of the changing gender identities of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Tweed, more than any other fashion textile, was integral to the shifting development and embodiment of new, modern conceptions of appearances, sport and leisure, which emerged for men, between the 1830s and the 1930s and for women, from the 1860s, up until the inter-war period. The project has also made an important contribution to extending research about menswear textiles between the 1820s and 2013, which has been a virtually non-existent field to date. It has also revealed the existence of a design dialogue between Scottish and French woollen textiles for women in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. This dialogue continues to resonate today, as shown by the international popularity of British-made, fantaisie tweeds.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>A key way in which my research findings are having impact is through the book Tweed. The extensive international distribution facilitated by Bloomsbury Publishers means that the research is being widely disseminated. This access will be further encouraged by the proposed inclusion of Tweed in the forthcoming Bloomsbury Textile Library, a site that will be available through institutional subscription, thus facilitating wide access for students. The book Tweed is aimed at the academic market. It is also relevant to general readers with an interest in textiles and individuals working in archives, museums, the media and fashion and textile industries. In 2017, the project findings will be taken forward and communicated to others through academic papers presented at the annual conferences of the Pasold Research Fund and the Association of Dress Historians. It is envisaged that the extensive research carried out will be further developed and disseminated through the publication of several peer-reviewed, journal articles. The project has identified the importance of heritage to the contemporary marketing of tweed and it has encouraged knowledge exchange and ongoing relationships between the researcher and industry. I am keen to maintain these relationships and to maximise any related future opportunities for social or economic impact.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>F8A5ED5F-A5FC-4275-B9FC-CE5A5327E6AB</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545b9e54c74329.90535581</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D3687FA4-748A-4823-B5B5-202616758566</gtr:id><gtr:title>British Design: Tradition and Modernity After 1948</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ccfc11ff53e1b9ad7cbfe57d5028f1e2"><gtr:id>ccfc11ff53e1b9ad7cbfe57d5028f1e2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>F Anderson</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-4725-0537-8</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>56d704ea669985.28887369</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AAA086B5-74F3-40BC-9B77-EA63DDD396FF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Tweed</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f7a37925c9980312efa7b484fd1d7833"><gtr:id>f7a37925c9980312efa7b484fd1d7833</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames> anderson f</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn> 9781845206963</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>54525b57d00f05.62473140</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/J007285/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>608431EA-925E-44D8-A1E2-8C24B4768085</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9E4BDAC2-CD51-4625-BCC1-5F768EE168D0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
