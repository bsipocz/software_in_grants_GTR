I will provide data to allow more personalised estimates of risk of potential side effects for a specified prescription. At present drugs are prescribed to patients based on how well each drug is tolerated on average. The dosage given is also determined for the average patient. This is problematic, as each patient is different and while one patient may respond well to a drug at a medium dosage, another may experience multiple side effects. Treating each patient the same when it comes to prescribing a drug may be increasing the risk of negative side effects in certain patients. Instead, medicine should be personalised to ensure risks are minimised for everyone. The difficulty with personalised medication is that it requires applying statistics on small subpopulations consisting of patients that are similar. When statistics are applied to these smaller subpopulations, the ability to detect negative side effects is reduced. This is known as having insufficient power for the statistical test. 

This research will develop a new artificial intelligence technique that combines multiple statistical analyses with the aim of ensuring the power is sufficiently large for identifying negative side effects in subpopulations. Such a technique will enable the extraction of personalised risk knowledge. One problem with extracting personalised risk knowledge is the amount of work required. It requires investigating lots of subpopulations and lots of potential side effects per drug. Standard methods to identify non-personalised risks for a single drug and single potential side effect can take months to prepare and hours to apply. I will use existing advanced computational methods that effectively divide and concur the problem. These methods can split up the whole analysis so that a computer can analyse each potential side effect for each subpopulation at the same time. Therefore, in the time it normally takes to analyse a single drug and single potential side effect, I can analyse a single drug and numerous potential side effects for each subpopulation.

The research will focus on the class of drugs 5-aminosalicylates given for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease as a proof of principle. The research outcome is identification of subpopulations that are at a higher risk of experiencing any known side effect to 5-aminosalicylates. By focusing on known side effects the method can be validated. After validation, the method will be expanded to identify new subpopulation specific side effects. It can then be generalised for other drugs and eventually it will help revolutionise drug prescribing, and ensure that the most suitable drug and dosage are chosen for the specific patient. The subpopulations considered will be based on patient's demographics (e.g. age, gender, race, smoking status, location), other drugs being taken and chronic illnesses.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>1: I will learn various study designs for testing the hypothesis that 5-aminosalicylates (5-ASA) cause renal failure for a specified strata. I will stratify analyses by patient demographics, co-prescriptions and chronic illnesses. I will create generalised software that can apply each study design to test the hypothesis that 5-ASA causes a specified outcome for a specified strata. I will tune parameters via a heuristic search that finds the minimum strata size required to maintain a low type ii error based on the health outcome. 

2: I will investigate ways to combine the different stratified studies; this is termed ensemble methods. This will require expert input to validate the ensemble result. I will also investigate various shrinkage techniques (methods that add a bias towards no association when the number of patients experiencing the potential association is small). The stratified ensemble method will be applied for 5-ASA and a selection of known adverse drug reactions. My medical collaborators will aid identifying to what extent the results accord with prior medical knowledge.

3: I will learn the latest distributed computing techniques (Hadoop and Spark). Hadoop breaks up the whole problem into lots of smaller ones calculating the measure of association for hundreds of strata and outcomes in parallel. The deliverable is an efficient way to calculate 5-ASA strata specific adverse drug reactions.

4: Validate the final system-Using half of the CPRD data, I will find all the Read codes that occur within 180 days of a prescription of a 5-ASA. I will then implement the distributed computing ensemble method for 5-ASA and all of these Read codes. This is large scale stratified hypothesis generation. Using the other half of the CPRD data, I will implement the same methodology on all the identified strata specific associations. This is testing the hypotheses previous generated. Overall, this will then identify any strata specific acute ADRs to 5-ASA.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The main impact of this research will be towards patients. This research will develop a new high performance methodology that can scale up current methods and potentially identify personalised risks based on patients' medical records. This research will include a proof of principle that focuses on identifying stratified risks for medicines given to treat inflammatory bowel disease. However, the CPRD contains records for the majority of drugs and outcomes, so the method can readily be applied for different drugs. In continued work, this methodology can be implemented for different medicines and eventually calculate the strata specific risks for a variety of drugs. This can complement biomarker drug development that finds strata specific effective medicine, by finding new knowledge on strata specific harms. This will help determine the overall drug cost/benefit for each strata and will help revolutionise the way patients are medically treated.

This research will be beneficial to pharmaceutical companies as it will enable them to identify stratified risks for their drugs. An indirect benefit of the research is that strata corresponding to off-label or off-target prescription of the drug can be investigated to determine the risks. If there are few risks identified then this may enable drug companied to update their drug labelling to include new targets or demographics. The research may also lead to new ADR discoveries, this knowledge would be useful for pharmaceutical companies as they can remove the drug from the market if the ADR is severe or include the ADRs on the label as a known ADRs. Therefore, overall the research it likely to lead to improved drug labelling.

This research will be of use to the WHO UMC as they can use the methodology developed to monitor drugs signals using their variety of longitudinal observation databases. The ADR signals generated can be evaluated and any new ADR discoveries can be disseminated to medication practitioners to prevent unnecessary patient morbidities. This research will have a direct impact on patients' healthcare across the world. The research will be useful for policy makers as it will highlight the positives of using longitudinal observation data for medical research. This may enable initiatives such as care.data to be more welcomed and similar initiatives to have less resistance in the future.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-09-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>260933</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/M015041/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>F3822669-BB5A-4BB4-BAE0-DCB9DE36E092</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Generic Health Relevance</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>7135039D-2DB0-4D41-87B3-FA1C8D38E133</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>6.1  Pharmaceuticals</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
