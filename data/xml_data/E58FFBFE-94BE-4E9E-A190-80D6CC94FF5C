Nonetheless, during the massive &amp;quot;occult revival&amp;quot; of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, in which older forms of esoteric belief and practice-scrying, alchemy, astral travel, and ritual magic- were rehabilitated or invented anew, occult ideas and figures became the stuff of mass culture, featuring regularly in popular fiction, film, and theatre and permeating social movements and political debates. Our project seeks to explain how and why the occult became so central to the period's popular imagination. By focusing on the allure and reach of the occult in this period, our network aims to understand the relationship between popular culture, religious heterodoxy, and the public sphere more broadly.

The popular expressions of the occult revival can tell us much about the changing face of religious belief, literary taste, mass entertainment and public debate in the period of our study. Yet despite its crucial role as an index to changing religious, aesthetic, social attitudes, British popular occulture remains crucially understudied, often sidelined within humanities research to accounts of the reception of occultism within the avant garde cultures of modernism. Our network aims to redress this critical neglect by asking:
 
1) How and why did the occult ideas burst into the popular cultural mainstream during the period of our study? 
2) What role did British popular occulture play in shaping ideas about social change, creativity, secularization, and the public sphere between 1875-1947?
3) What new perspectives on the stakes of popular occulture can be forged by bringing together scholars from across disciplines (history, literary, cultural, and periodical studies, theatre studies, religious studies) with librarians, curators, digital humanists, and non-academic holders of archives?

In asking these questions, we seek to break down the boundaries between esotericism and exotericism, between elite and the mass cultural forms, that have previously constrained studies of the occult revival. 

To understand a subject as eclectic as popular occulture, it is necessary to take an interdisciplinary approach. The project brings together a range of scholars, curators, librarians, and non-academic holders of archives at three workshops, each focusing on a distinct interaction between occultism and British popular culture in the years between 1875-1947. The first will consider the encounter between the occult and popular fiction and entertainment; the second, the development of the occult public sphere through specialist periodicals and the reception of occultism in the mainstream press; the third, the contribution of occult ideas and proponents to popular social movements such as feminism, socialism, eugenics, and anti-imperialism. Academic participants will benefit from access to new disciplinary and methodological perspectives and the expertise of non-academic experts and stakeholders; curators, librarians, and archive holders will gain new angles on, and ways of contextualizing for the public, the rich popular legacy of the occult revival. All participants will benefit from the network's promotion and facilitation of international collaboration. The project will maintain a website and blog, enabling conversation to continue between workshops and extending the network beyond immediate participants; it will host visits to key occult archives and sites in Glasgow, Dublin, and London, thus encouraging knowledge exchange between scholars, curators, librarians, archive holders, and digital humanists; it will impact on exhibitions of occult archives and art; and it will produce an edited essay collection of selected workshop talks, constituting the first scholarly book to focus solely on the popular dimensions of the British occult revival.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our project will benefit users within and beyond the academy, including the general public. It will have impact on the following groups:

Curators and Artists: Francis McKee, Curator of Glasgow's Centre for Contemporary Arts, and Marco Pasi, Religious Studies scholar and co-curator of occult art exhibits in Paris and Melbourne, will sit on the advisory board and participate in workshops; artist and RCA tutor Catherine Anyango and curator P&amp;aacute;draic Moore, although not official network members due to team size constraints, will attend workshops. The impact on arts professionals will come through knowledge exchange with the scholars and practitioners involved in the network. Moore, Pasi, and McKee both have curatorial interests in occultism and the visual arts; the workshops will impact on their interpretive strategy and on the planning of a pending CCA exhibition of occult-themed contemporary art planned for late 2018, after the cessation of network activities. The network will ultimately have impact on the CCA's visitors (approximately 320,000 a year). Anyango is a multi-media artist currently planning a drawing exhibition inspired by spirit photography and the history of psychical research; the network will impact on her selection and contextualization of source images, and thus on future viewers of her work.

Archivists and Librarians: The impact on archivists will be in the form of knowledge exchange with scholars and occult practitioners. Christopher Jossife, Philip Young (both London-based),and Julie Gardham (Glasgow) will attend their locations' workshops,benefiting from the expertise of participants who will themselves gain improved knowledge of occult collections. Network participation will allow archivists and librarians to understand the reach and relevance of British popular occulture, and consider ways in which their collections might be used in outreach activity to scholars and the wider public.

Non-Academic Holders of Archives: This project will includenon-academic holders of significant private occult archives who will benefit from exchanging knowledge with network scholars.Erica Georgiades and Kevin Tingay are members of the Friends of the Theosophical Archives project; R.A. Gilbert is a prolific occult historian and holder of archives related to various early twentieth-century British occult organizations; Leslie Price contributes to the editing of Britain's longest running spiritualist newspaper Light and acts as archivist for the College of Psychic Studies's Library; Malcolm McQueen manages the Glasgow Theosophical Society and its library. All four will gain new viewpoints which will impact on their resource users; academic participants will in turn benefit from their knowledge of private occult archives.

GU Special Collections Exhibition:To coincide with the Glasgow workshop, Special Collections at GU will host an exhibition of selected late nineteenth and early twentieth-century works from its landmark Ferguson Collection (comprised of over 7,500 works alchemical,occult,and related literature).This activity and its accompanying online Flickr display will create knowledge exchange between archivists and scholars and raise awareness of the University's collections among visitors.

Website/Blog:This will impact on the general public by delivering an accessible, non-specialist account of the network and its activities. By linking into social media, it will advertise the project well beyond the academy. The site will host synopses of the workshops and allow the public to register for workshops (where space allows)or view recordings of talks and participant interviews from wherever they may be in the world. Recorded talks and interviews will be uploaded to YouTube and thus rendered available to users who may not have navigated through the central project website. Given the global accessibility of these outlets to web users, their potential impact is enormous;the site will track visitors with a hit counter.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>34695</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Popular Occulture in Britain Website, Blog, FB Account, and Twitter Feed</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EC66DAC9-617C-48B5-9F9B-79ED8095C03A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We have set up a website for our project which lists details about all team members, workshop programmes and paper abstracts, and regular blog posts from stakeholders in esotericism studies form within and beyond the academy; we are also currently in the process of uploading video interviews with speakers at the November workshop, along with audio recordings of their talks.

We had an audience of approximately 150, consisting of members of the general public, psychic practitioners, physicists, engineers, and curators from the British Museum. The subsequent debate was lively and even rowdy at time, as different audience members expressed their varying delight and dismay to hear about this aspect of the Nobel Prize winner's career. We received inquiries about the project afterwards. The event host Samira Ahmed is in the process of pitching a larger documentary project on this topic; should it be funded, I will likely be invited to act as an expert interviewee.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>589ca7737a91f8.93212907</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.rigb.org/whats-on/events-2017/february/public-spirits-in-the-ether</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>&quot;The Case of Lucifer: Blavatsky, Collins, and Periodical Occulture in Late Victorian Britain.&quot;</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>20CCDECF-A51D-4F73-8035-A7D2C757023B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I gave a talk at the Edinburgh Theosophical Society which introduced the project and used it to frame a discussion of Theosophical periodical publishing in the late nineteenth century, focusing specifically on H.P.

It featured 7 speakers from within and beyond the academy, including Professor Wouter Hanegraaff (Centre for Hermetic Philosophy and Related Currents, University of Amsterdam), Professor Richard Hand (Media Studies, University of East Anglia), Professor Nick Daly (English Literature, UCD), Padraic Moore (Independent Curator, Brussels, BG), Dr Patricia Pulham (English Literature, University of Portsmouth), Professor Darryl Jones (English Literature, Trinity College Dublin), and Dr Steven Sutcliffe (Religious Studies University of Edinburgh). We reach our attendance capacity of 30, with audience members including postgraduate students, academics, and film makers (Sean Martin). The papers and the closing roundtable discussion helped to shape the project's accompanying essay collection, on which we are currently working. Audience members noted on our response cards that the workshop had changed and improved their understanding of the topic. It also led to an invitation from Professor Hanegraaff to establish an &amp;quot;Esotericism and Literature&amp;quot; network for ESSWE (European Society for the Study of Western Esotericism). The event concluded with a reception and tour of local heritage site and Dublin Freemason's Hall.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>589ca1492444f8.20224086</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.stir.ac.uk/popular-occulture-in-britain/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Explorathon Screening of &quot;Night of the Demon&quot; and Q&amp;A on Occulture and British Film</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1387BA6F-D370-45EB-B679-717819235034</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As part of the 2016 Explorathon Festival, Dr David Rollinson (University of Stirling) and I co-hosted a screening of Jacques Tourneur's classic 1953 British horror film &amp;quot;Night of the Demon,&amp;quot; followed by a Q&amp;amp;A session in which I introduced the network and led a discussion about the popular reception of occult figures and ideas in twentieth-century British film and literature.

Its most significant achievements include the hosting of talks by Professor Wouter Hanegraaff, Professor Richard Hand, Professor Nicholas Daly, Padraic Moore, Dr Patricia Pulham, Professor Darryl Jones, and Dr Steven Sutcliffe. All talks were recorded; most are in the process of being uploaded to our website. The event also included a closing round table on the subject of popular occulture which will help to seed future additional planned output of special issue proposal to the Journal of Victorian Culture. All speakers also took part in video-recorded impact interviews about their research interests in relation to popular occulture, which are in the process of being uploaded to our website. All award objectives for this part of the grant have been met, with the exception that some of our talk recordings were compromised due to microphone problems, and not all are useable. We are working to correct this problem for our next workshop, scheduled for for July 14 2017 at Birkbeck, University of London. The findings from this workshop will be taking forward in two way: 1) some of the speakers are in the process of extending their talks for publication in our edited volume The Occult Imagination in Britain, 1875-1947; 2) the roundtable discussion provided ideas and angles for future special issue proposal to the Journal of Victorian Culture.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Talks and interviews from Workshop 1 will soon be live via our website, which also hosts blog posts on research-in-progress and archive information for researchers on this topic.
