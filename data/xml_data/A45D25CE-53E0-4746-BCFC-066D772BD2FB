Despite major advances, connection over large distances from small communities to existing grids is costly due to the cables, substations and additional equipment required. By 2008, 40% of Africans had access to electricity, but in sparsely populated rural areas the average drops to a mere 22.7%, in stark contrast to the 80% global average. Although many individual sites in rural areas, particularly mobile phone masts, have their own generators, there has been a reluctance to extend these to create local electricity networks. The use of small, independent electricity grids, powered by renewable or fossil fuel generators, presents operational and financial challenges. 

The proposed ESCoBox is thus indented to address financial and practical barriers to electricity access by enabling local agents to act as small (but expandable) Energy Service Companies (ESCos), by buying power wholesale from larger off-grid generators (e.g. mobile phone mast operators) and selling it to local customers. The ESCoBox is an enabling technology that will allow cross-sector innovation, from novel financing, to social interventions, entrepreneurial ventures and better designed technologies and services</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>ESCoBox will be an open-source technology platform with wireless communications capability that complements clean energy interventions in rural Africa. It aims to facilitate local entrepreneurship (providing affordable electricity for wealth-creating activities and establishing local Energy Service Companies), via pro-poor pricing models and cashless micro-payments for end-users. Additional societal benefits may accrue: e.g. improved water management, access to healthcare, ICT and entertainment, and - being low-carbon energy - all this without pollution. ESCoBox will provide high resolution, real-time data on end-user behaviour to facilitate more appropriate technology and service design, plus remote control and wireless telecommunications (e.g. for MPesa payments). The technology will be scalable from individual lantern to mini-grid. It provides a culturally-appropriate, accepted mechanism whereby 'agents' in remote areas can take care of local management and service delivery.

Two key aspects of ESCoBox make it powerful tool: firstly, a 'smart' control and monitoring system that optimises the operation of energy networks at various scales and levels of autonomy (e.g. off-grid or grid connected) to ensure reliability of energy supply, lower cost and longer system life; secondly, it is underpinned by the sophisticated, agent-based, CASCADE software model that provides a powerful Decision Support Tool (DST) for the adaptation and optimisation of both functional control (for reliability, efficiency, flexibility, responsiveness, cost-effectiveness) and commercial models (for user-focussed system evolution, market growth and business development, economic risk reduction and investment support).

Dissemination to the community and potential users, plus businesses, policy makers and academia, will be focussed though a number of activities: (1) engagement of potential customers (end users, NGOs, ESCos); (2) user needs analysis; (3) identification of possible sites (including existing projects) on which to test prototypes; (4) training and capacity building of local technicians to install, maintain and operate ESCoBoxes in the field (5) establishment of a project website, leaflets, newsletters, blogs; (6) dissemination to the academic research community.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>843942</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Nairobi</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Kenya, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:department>School of Engineering</gtr:department><gtr:description>Strauss Energy</gtr:description><gtr:id>7433A25D-FF6D-4AF9-B864-161EF3CAA1E8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Development of an innovative solar (PV) roof tile.

Many of these have been implemented, with others scheduled as part of a future growth strategy for the system. On a second visit by ESCoBox team members, the DST was used to design modifications to the mini-grid system to enable future expansion in usage and revenue generation, while further immediate improvements were undertaken in collaboration with local technicians and engineers. ESCoBox control hardware was also installed to implement demand management techniques that reduce costs while improving performance and reliability. Thus, in return for providing a field-test site for the ESCoBox system, Global Hands Gambia is getting its previously-failing energy system working, due largely to the intervention of ESCoBox. This collaboration brings together technical and social science specialists and is providing technical, economic and societal data that has been highly valuable to the ESCoBox project and will continue to inform follow-on research. It has also created a platform for ongoing research activities, nurturing local Gambian talent and providing in-country facilities for training, field-testing,business model development and deployment of sustainability measures that are expected to include energy, water, cooking, agricultural and transport technologies. With the dramatic political changes experienced in the Gambia recently, the path is now clear for this collaboration to significantly effect policies relating to these fields , due to the influence that Global Hands has the new political administration.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dfc5fa4303f2.50456708-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Providing access to stand-alone solar mini-grid systems (representing approximately &amp;pound;30,000 of assets) and solar home systems in real-world operation for use as a test-bed for the ESCoBox Decision Support Tool and, potentially, for its 'smart grid' control system.

Each year, project partners meet for a week in a region where the micro-grids are being installed (Kenya, Malawi), during which these discussions are undertaken, plus individual team members have been engaged in similar face-to-face discussions with end-users in The Gambia, India, Nepal, Zimbabwe and Rwanda. In addition to the insights gained by the ESCoBox team, considerable knowledge and information is passed on to the numerous and varied people with which they are interacting (end-users, potential end-users, school children, students, entrepreneurs, policy makers), who are always very receptive to this new knowledge and generally highly enthusiastic about its potential.

As well as educating us, these visits to various communities are a powerful way of spreading the word about what we are doing to those who are most able to benefit from it. Those who are already connected to the micro-grids gain useful information about efficiency measures and behaviours through which they can get the most out of the service, while those yet to be connected begin to see what wealth-creation and quality-of-life benefits can be gained if they join.

Having gained considerable insight into this, we applied that knowledge to the technical design of the system. ESCoBox's Decision Support Tool (DST), which helps to predict and manage power demand profiles, is being used to analyze failure modes and inefficiencies in under-performing mini-grids in The Gambia, where we are carrying out field trials of the system. The battery State of Health (SOH) model, which feeds into the DST, provided insights that underpinned important guidance to a failing energy kiosk business in Malawi to enable it to transform into a viable enterprise that gives valuable service to the local community. One of the key findings from the ESCoBox project is the degree to which human factors (skills and education, social and cultural factors, commercial acumen and professionalism) must be addressed to ensure the success of energy delivery systems. On the basis of these findings, plus the functional capabilities of ESCoBox, we are building relationships in India, Nepal, Malawi, Kenya, Rwanda, Zimbabwe, The Gambia, Nigeria and Ghana to enable future work in developing the necessary skills and education needed, alongside implementation of the technical aspects of ESCoBox, which is intended to maximize its impact. We are also preparing research proposals that extend ESCoBox's role into zero-emission transport provision to provide remote communities with access to wider markets for income generation.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>0CB8DBA7-E546-44CB-A175-9130CFEBD32F</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5463703e2fe1b0.18731491</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Energy,Environment,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Retail</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Understanding the needs of the users is critical to implementing a successful system. Much of what we have learnt in the ESCoBox project has been in the development of this understanding. So, what we have discovered about the practical, social, economic and cultural aspects of energy supply and usage in low-income, rural, off-grid communities is being fed into our technical development of micro-grids. One of the key findings in this respect is that - even in areas of great poverty - such systems must be founded upon strong commercial models to be viable, sustainable and to achieve ongoing wealth creation and improvements in the quality of life of poor communities. Having seen the challenges (and often failures) encountered by numerous existing (and some proposed) energy systems in the Global South that we have visited, it is becoming increasingly clear that this need for commercial viability and sustainability is severely hampered by extremely low levels of professionalism in the planning, implementation, operation and maintenance of systems. ESCoBox offers tools to assist in techno-economic optimization, but the need for fundamental and extensive training is an urgent requirement if these systems are to be successfully deployed and operated. Therefore, our recommendation is that further work in this field would include a major component of training and education in concert with any technical developments. In applying good business practice ourselves, we have focused on developing simple-but-effective methods of service delivery, thus we have dispensed with many of the more complex 'smart grid' techniques in favor of a simple, financially-incentivised, timeslot-allocation offer to high-demand users.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We hope that others will, like us, use these findings to guide their development of mini-grid technology and service delivery models to create systems that have a greater beneficial impact on quality-of-live in poor rural or peri-urban communities.
We have provided open-source versions of the ESCoBox Decision Support Tool (DST) and published papers explaining how ESCoBox methodologies can be used. Various aspects of the ESCoBox system will be taken forward into future research, such as the battery State-of-Health monitoring, models and algorithms, the load disaggregation techniques, control systems, DST, needs and impacts assessment, and a wide range of knowledge and experience gained first-hand by work in the field. 
Now that ESCoBox has established a robust mechanism for incentivising (by price) and implementing timeslot allocation for certain electrical loads to improve system reliability and costs, this can be explored further with particular demand loads in mind. For example, we shall be investigating the application of incentivised timeslot allocation to high-efficiency electric cooking, which can reduce deforestation and health risks caused by burning wood or charcoal fuel. 
Access to electric power enables increased productivity for small businesses in off-grid communities, but it is through selling this extra product to a wider market that creates increased income. Therefore, we shall also be investigating the viability of powering electric vehicles from mini-grids, which can give small businesses the necessary physical access to wider markets, thus fully unlocking the potential benefits of the provision of electricity in the first instance. This also exploits the many advantages of electric vehicles that can be particularly relevant to such communities.
Training and the professionalisation of those involved in energy provision and management is another area that our future research will address as we have seen this to be a critical weakness in mini-grid systems that fail to deliver on their original promise.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>1DC1F60D-502E-479F-B8F2-FDA75CBD5705</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546368c5880d27.50653848</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Electronics,Energy,Environment,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Retail,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.dmu.ac.uk/research/research-faculties-and-institutes/institute-of-energy-and-sustainable-development/research-projects/escobox.aspx</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Two methods of battery SOH estimation have been developed within the ESCoBox project.

This significantly aids in the design and management of reliable and cost-effective micro-grids and is designed to work in conjunction with widely used mini-grid design packages such as HOMER or as a stand-alone application. The Decision Support Tool (DST) is designed to run in the ubiquitous Microsoft Excel program, so as to maximize accessibility and minimize cost. It is used to improve the accuracy of estimating how much installed demand load can be accommodated on a mini-grid while reducing the risk of overload and blackouts. In particular, it enables the time-shifting of demand to be tested for technical and economic efficiency before implementation, thereby reducing risk (to users and investors). It works in conjunction with ESCoBox's control system to automatically implement demand shaping that protects the energy system from overload while improving its cost-effectiveness.</gtr:description><gtr:id>6E11160D-42B5-4FB8-BDBE-6BCAFB47C444</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The ESCoBox DST is being used to optimize the design and control of mini-grids to maximize usage (thereby improving ROI), stability, reliability, availability, efficiency and affordability of energy services.

It will also be used in de-risking (technically and financially) the expansion of established mini-grids with growing demand.

Users of power-hungry devices can reduce their energy costs by purchasing power through a Time of Use (ToU) tariff, which is implemented via this new control software that is being developed in the ESCoBox project. There are a number of ways of doing this, but in the ESCoBox project we have narrowed these down to one option, which is to sell allotted time-slots to high power users. This is to gain the greatest benefit with the greatest simplicity, as complex arrangements are less likely to be taken up by customers. The program is currently being developed and tested on a Raspbery-Pi platform to allow a low-cost, widely-deployable solution. It is intended that this software will be made Open Source.</gtr:description><gtr:id>189747CD-159C-48B8-8ADB-8A82B0D8790C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The primary use of this controller will be in implementing time-slot allocations to high power demand loads on power-limited mini-grids, such as those supplied from hydro-electric generators. This technique reduces the chance of overloading the system at peak demand periods by activating power supply circuits to high-power load at pre-allocated time-slots during off-peak periods. This allows more customers to be served at lower cost to them, while increasing reliability of the mini-grid and improving the operator's Return on Investment (ROI) by keeping the system running closer to full capacity. It can also be applied to energy-limited mini-grids, such as those supplied from wind or solar generators. In this situation, the time-slots are sold at preferential rates during periods of high solar (or wind) input. This reduces reliance on batteries, allowing smaller (and cheaper) battery banks, which are put under much less stress so that they last longer. Thus blackouts and battery damage are reduced as are lifetime costs and therefore customer tariffs.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54620ed2bfee75.25165225</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Demand Management
