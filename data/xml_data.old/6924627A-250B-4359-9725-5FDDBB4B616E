This project will examine the under-researched area of women artists' early video experimentation in the 1970s and 1980s within Europe. The emergence of video as a new medium, allowed women artists to create art using a flexible format that could be adapted to their practice. Issues inherent within gender identity - the body, fertility, motherhood, sexuality, violence against women, stereotypical images of women portrayed by the media, relationships, sexual discrimination, and what is was to be a female professional artist - could now be developed as moving image art forms and expressed with a visual fluency. Only few reference sources exist on women artists' early experimentations with video and of these, most concentrate upon female artists working in the USA. As yet, no large-scale academic study has specifically assessed the role of the female video artist and their experimentation with video and wider impact on culture in Europe.

This project aims to retrace women artists' stories, their works in video and their achievements to the benefit of academia, and to strengthen the profiles and identities of women artists within the art historical canon. First-person testimony will be sought as a primary research tool in a series of semi-structured interviews with the surviving artists, curators and animateurs of the period.

The research will be undertaken by:
1) Archival and bibliographical research
2) Interviews with the surviving artists, curators and animateurs of the period.
3) Rediscovery and occasional recovery of seminal women artists' works
4) Reassessment of the works
5) Workshops and screening with artists
6) Making of a Chronology of Women Artists' use of video.

The research findings will be published in an edited book, articles and presented in conferences and will provide an authoritative source on early women artists' experimentation of videotape as a new medium and language for their artworks.
The results will create an essential tool for future focuses on specific artists, works and archives at risk of loss and the recovery of those works that have not yet been re-mastered on digital format.

The outcomes of the project will contribute to meeting the challenges of the EU Equality Commision's Strategy for equality between Women and Men 2010-2015 and to an enhanced agency of women's achieving in the field of visual arts and video art in particular within Europe</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The results of the research on early Women's Video Art (70s and 80s) will fill a fundamental gap in the history of the practice and will provide a unique, fundamental and useful resource to individuals and organizations that promote and exhibit video art including contemporary art museum, archives, foundations, media centres, media theoreticians, art history scholars, broadcasters and critics. 

The collaborations with subject protagonists and world class specialists will enable to create a subject-specialist base from which to develop an evolved range of future research and implementation projects involving exhibitions, screenings, publications (books and DVD), and online recourses such as a Women Video Art online catalogue. The Website will include ephemera, articles, interviews, catalogue of works and artists and be hosted by the main REWIND database, which is well established as a major online resource, and since 2006 has received 1.5M hits from 98 countries, over 50,000 interview or other asset downloads (rewind.ac.uk).

The publication will constitute a reference resource on early Women artists' video from the 70s and 80s. The Investigators will also present papers at appropriate international conferences.

An international symposium, Women's Video Art will be organized to take place at University of Dundee: this will disseminate the results of the research and bring the research and the subject under the international spotlight. Furthermore it will help consolidate the network of contacts and will encourage exchanges on the topic.

A call for papers will also be issued in order to involve a broader range of scholars, researchers and practitioners at all levels and from different disciplines and will be advertised on the project webpage, through social networks and on online platforms and mailing lists. Results of the symposium will be published online on the project webpage.

Beyond the academic arena, the project will promote a new agency of gender equality within the visual arts in the new generations, providing new role models in particular to emergent women video artists.

Screenings with artists will be organised for universities' students and for general public, starting with a TATE Modern event, and then in other museums within Europe.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>234872</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>EWVA participated at the BNL Media Art Festival in Rome. This takes the form of an installed screening program at MAXXI National Museum of the 21st Century Arts, Rome (13-17 April 2017).
 
The selection included artworks by some of the most influential European women artists who were video pioneers in the 1970s and 1980s. A broad range of topics and approaches to video were shown. These included experimentation exploring the possibilities of the medium, video installation, multi-media and performance. The selected themes addressed: the critic to broadcast TV, identity, the relationship with their body, ephemerality of life, perception, pregnancy and maternity, the opposition between Nature and civilisation, how women are represented by the media, the role of women in society.

'Doppelg&amp;auml;nger' was recovered during the AHRC funded research project REWIND (DJCAD, University of Dundee), led by Prof Stephen Partridge, in 2012.
'Doppelg&amp;auml;nger Redux' was curated by Laura Leuzzi (EWVA PDRA) and Adam Lockhart (EWVA Archivist).
 
Doppelg&amp;auml;nger is one of the only two surviving videos of Shemilt's early experimentation with the medium. Shemilt employed video as a tool for introspection by manipulating her image, her face and her body. In Doppelg&amp;auml;nger, Shemilt created a phantasmal double of herself exploring key feminist themes such as identity, sexuality, duality, women's role in society and the status of professional women artists.
 
After three decades, Shemilt re-enacted, reactivated and reacted to the piece, sourcing from research materials from her own archive, and explored a new performative version of these key feminist issues.
A video documentation of the piece was produced and published on www.ewva.ac.uk.</gtr:description><gtr:id>FA4CE537-32F6-4B89-8AC2-D6EAA340B6D0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>'Doppelg&amp;auml;nger Redux' was discussed and shown at the 2016 Film and Media Aesthetics Conference in University of Roma Tre by Dr Laura Leuzzi in her paper &amp;quot;Early video art and re-enactment: some reflections upon forms and approaches towards media to re-enact, re-act and re-perform pioneering video artworks from the 70s and the 80s&amp;quot; and by Prof. Shemilt at the Shanghai Minsheng Art Museum at a lecture for the opening of the exhibition 'CURRENT: Contemporary Art from Scotland'.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5878c8fa516a41.90832384</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Doppelg?nger Redux</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artwork</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://ewva.ac.uk/doppelganger-redux-2016.html</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Prof. Elaine Shemilt, &quot;We do not have bodies, we are bodies&quot;, Contemporary Film and Media Aesthetics : Culture, Nature, and Technology in the 21st Century.

Both Shemilt and Leuzzi presented power point presentations. Doppelganger, seminal video artwork by Shemilt, was projected.
A &amp;quot;Media&amp;quot; round table followed led by Amy Tobin and Sarah Cook with Elaine Shemilt and Laura Leuzzi.
Practitioners, curators, scholars and PhD students participating to the workshop welcomed very warmly Leuzzi and Shemilt's presentation with several questions and inquiries also during the round table and in the after event.
The event helped to build a network of contacts.

This screening weaves together the visual narratives of 12 international women artists or collectives who have worked around questions of identity and self-determination, often in confrontation to their respective social and political contexts. Employing real and interpreted voices, lyrics and unorthodox visual techniques, their works address female sexuality, motherhood, ecology and violence.
Self/Portraits: Relating Narratives employs varied methodological tools, including dialogue, autobiography, cross-genre and fragmented narratives. This curatorial approach is inspired by two Italian feminist authors who located everyday narratives and exchanges at the heart of their philosophical and political strategies. The radical thinker Carla Lonzi and her book Autoritratto [Self-portrait] (1969), offered an unprecedented montage of different artists' interviews recomposed by the author in a continuous flux, a convivial conversation, and most significantly, as a personal portrait carved out of relations between artists and their critics. It also refers to feminist philosopher Adriana Cavarero's book Relating Narratives: Storytelling and Selfhood (2000), where an exploration of identity is framed as the desire to hear one's story narrated by an other.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58a318efe5dc55.91784106</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ewva.ac.uk/self-portraits-vrc-2016.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Launch of EWVA at Rome Media Art Festival</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7E06BBE9-3B7F-4FD7-A55D-68FA82B73DC0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>E.
