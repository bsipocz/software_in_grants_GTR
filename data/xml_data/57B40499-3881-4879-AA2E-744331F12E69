In response, the UKs National Pollinator Strategy (NPS) has catalysed landscape scale conservation projects aimed at protecting pollinating insects that support biodiversity and sustainable food production. Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (CAONB) has initiated new work to help deliver the NPS aims, and this Innovation Internship will create a partnership between the University of Exeter (UoE) and CAONB to advise, support and extend this. The intern, Dr Grace Twiston-Davies (GTD), will utilise the cutting-edge suite of pollinator computer models, developed at UoE (with Research Council UK funding), to provide robust scientific evidence that can inform the strategic implementation of wild pollinator conservation at CAONB. GTD will share her extensive biodiversity and pollinator ecology expertise to further CAONB's initiative to improve the Cornish landscape for pollinators. In return, CAONB partners, will share invaluable expertise in how best to work with land stewards and owners to benefit the environment; and will give vital feedback on how we can integrate our models to fit the needs of beneficiaries. This collaboration will provide a sustainable relationship with multiple benefits for both partners that extend beyond the duration of the Internship, since both plan to further their work to effectively improve landscape management for pollinators.

Agricultural landscapes cover 2/3 of the CAONB, providing an opportunity to make a significant contribution to pollinator conservation. However, there is poor uptake of the pollinator targeted management options (e.g. Countryside Stewardship options) like nectar flower mixes and grassland floral diversity enhancement. It is unclear as to what scale and density these options need to be administered at in order to maximise their ecological benefits and there is currently no mechanism for comparing the relative effects of different options to aid decision-making. This Internship will enable management recommendations to be made based on the predictions of relative bumblebee colony success to assist CAONB in implementing pollinator management most effective to the specific option and landscape. By potentially targeting grassland under agricultural use, this project covers two of the NERC Innovation priority areas; Sustainable Food Production, by increasing the sustainability of the beef and dairy industry through the enhancement of grassland sward diversity and Natural Resources, by managing natural resources of biodiversity and pollination services at CAONB. 

CAONB have recently published their 2016-2021 management plan which includes &amp;quot;Investing in Nature&amp;quot; policies specifically involving supporting land managers to increase ecosystem services and biodiversity. Now is the opportune time to strategically implement pollinator friendly management options. CAONB have invested in a Project Development Officer; Richard Hardy to help implement key objectives of the National Pollinator Strategy within the AONB and to launch new pollinator focused projects. They are keen to capitalise on the ecological expertise available in the pollinator research team at the UoE to maximise the impact of the project. GTD will therefore, bridge the knowledge gap between the partners, and share her expertise in landscape-scale grassland ecology and pollinator models. This will be transformative to the organisation in informing evidence-based decision making in order to enhance the Cornish landscape for pollinators. 

This project will provide a high profile impact case-study resulting from Research Council UK funded ecological modelling research (BBSRC, NERC), and will result in on-going and long-lasting impact for both partners, providing the opportunity for partners to develop further funding bids and projects together.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>24143</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/P010725/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5B25B6A3-B218-4F11-8A9D-661236DF455C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agri-environmental science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>1A1A6805-9DC4-4BCE-BC70-9F2AA4FD093B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ecol, biodivers. &amp; systematics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>794345CD-A1D5-4984-ADDD-088BCF41822F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agricultural systems</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5020ECC8-E0E8-434D-BDD5-663A9C04EFA2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Conservation Ecology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
