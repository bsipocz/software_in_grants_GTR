and heritage</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/N00289X/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This follow on project 's key aim is to identify one or more pilgrimage trail in the Isle of Man and in collaboration with stakeholder groups, trails will be supported by low-impact digital interpretation resources which will facilitate individuals and groups' exploration of the Island's faith heritage, with the potential to attract new and returning cultural and faith-based tourists.

This builds on the original research project on Pilgrimage and Landscape. The Isle of Man was one of three case studies for this project, when annual prayer walks to the remains of medieval chapels known as keeills were studied as there is no designated pilgrimage route on the Island. This original research project evidenced the demand for and appreciation of current occasional opportunities for residents and visitors to engage with the faith heritage of the Island, as well as a significant potential audience and appetite for: i) accessible resource-based interpretation material which would allow year round self-led engagement with the keeills; ii) a desire to identify one or more permanent pilgrimage routes on the Island; and iii) that these could provide a foundation for developing faith-based heritage tourism. 

Working with an established network of collaborating groups on the Island, such as Manx National Heritage, Cathedral Isle of Man and Praying the Keeills, this project will identify one or more pilgrimage routes, utilising existing footpaths and heritage sites, including the keeills; and will create a guide to these pilgrimage trails, with links to maps and historic interpretation material. These resources will be available online via a dedicated website and smartphone apps (hence it being described as a virtual trail) with minimal low-impact signposting. Print copies of resources and an audio guide will also be available via Manx National Heritage for those without internet access. 

Building on previous research project findings, existing heritage resources and recent church-led initiatives, this project will provide a resource for locals and tourists to explore the intertwined faith heritage and landscape of the island, primarily through the activity of walking, with alternative route information provided for those of limited mobility who may need to travel by vehicle. It is also hoped that the trail/s will act as a catalyst for the Isle of Man's recent cross-organisation initiative to develop faith-heritage tourism as well as attracting other long-distance walkers.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>a) Who will benefit from this research?

The key non-academic beneficiaries of this project will be three broad constituencies:

1. Faith communities on the Isle of Man, notably: the Diocese of Sodor and Mann, Praying the Keeills Group, the Island Spirituality Network, and those interested in other sacred spaces on the Island e.g. Neo-Pagans

2. Residents and tourists interested in Celtic and ecclesiastical cultural heritage, including the wider international community of Christian pilgrimage practitioners, cultural heritage tourists and long-distance trail walkers. 

3. Tourism service providers on the Isle of Man

b) How will they benefit from this research?

1. The churches and ecumenical groups such as Praying the Keeills Group and the Island Spirituality Network seek to encourage wider engagement for IoM residents with the keeills and other faith heritage sites on the Isle of Man; this project will provide easily accessible guides and information on the keeills, filling in the 'missing links' between the larger scale and well-developed faith heritage sites such as Rushen Abbey. These resources would allow individuals and groups to be aware of, find, visit and interpret the keeills as suited their purposes (ranging from a half day walk to 5-7 day long-distance trek).

2. The same applies for those travelling to the Island seeking Celtic cultural heritage, pilgrimage routes or for walking holidays (e.g. those tourists attending the IoM Walking Festival could extend their visit/ return to take a self-guided holiday based on the pilgrimage route resources).

3. The Celtic faith heritage of the Island has already attracted modest numbers of UK, European and North American visitors (e.g. as part of a Celtic West tour). A designated pilgrimage route would provide a platform to publicise that heritage more widely and thereby attract more visitors, bringing increased numbers and a more diverse visitor-base, providing income for tourism service providers such as cottage-rental, hotel and B&amp;amp;B owners, car hire etc.. It is anticipated it will take a 3-5 year period to establish and evidence this growth in visitors. Stakeholders in the project planning group have also identified potential retreat centres for development in the medium term.

4. The Island's economy has been adversely affected by the recession and would benefit from even a modest increase in tourism income, especially sustainable shoulder season environmentally-friendly non-motorsport related tourism.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-09-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>23900</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Manx National Heritage</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Isle of Man</gtr:country><gtr:description>Virtual Pilgrimage Trail Partners</gtr:description><gtr:id>2B6A3EFC-1796-4DF3-94DA-7F554A596B02</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Trails, interpretation resources etc. under development for September 2016 launch.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dda62b4ecac0.16054455-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>i) Participating in management group of Pilgrimage Trails and providing heritage interpretation expertise (MNH, CIoM, PTK)

Over 70 children walked the labyrinth mat, also giving opportunities to talk to accompanying parents; c 50 sets of games and wordsearches were taken and 30 'favourite keeills' identified; c 100 adults engaged with the stall, talked about the proposed pilgrimage routes etc., including IoM government representatives, clergy, walkers, Third Sector groups, tourist service providers and other interested parties. Examples of engagement include: two teachers asked to use pilgrimage activity sheets in school; a charity discussed using the pilgrimage trail for a fund-raising sponsored walk; a family planning to walk the whole coastal path in stages indicated they would use the Raad ny Foillan Pilgrimage Trail interpretation materials to organize and provide a focus for their walks.

This work has been undertaken in partnership with Manx National Heritage, Cathedral Isle of Man and the Praying the Keeills group, including numerous volunteers. 
Two initial trails have been developed, one linking the key ecclesiastical sites of Maughold, St German's Cathedral and Rushen Abbey; the second is focusing on the medieval keeills (remains of chapels and cells) and carved stone crosses found on or near the Raad ny Foillan (Way of the Gull) coastal path - which celebrated its 30th anniversary on 2016. 
The launch of the trails and resources took place 9-11th September 2016. This included a service with the Bishop, a Manx gaelic gig, art exhibition and short pilgrimage walk; a dedicated website and franchised section of a walking app provides digital materials for 'virtual' pilgrimage on the Isle of Man. 
The partner group is now led by Dr Kirsty Neate of Manx National Heritage and road based trails are being developed.</gtr:description><gtr:id>6165BAD4-C196-4A5C-BDCA-3E5D2F455DF0</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56dd82ce6cf9f7.37681040</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Developing digital interpretation materials to create a 'virtual' pilgrimage has shown how varied interest groups, religious, broadly spiritual and secular, are highly interested in and engaged by faith heritage in the Isle of Man.
