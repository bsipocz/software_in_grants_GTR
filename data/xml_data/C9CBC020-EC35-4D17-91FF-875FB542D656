Promoting the well-being of the population is a focus for most governments, so it is crucial to understand what affects well-being in older adults and to identify the policy levers that can promote well-being.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Many older people report that social relationships are particularly important to them, so our project focuses on different aspects of social relationships and how these are related to well-being.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This study is a collaboration between an academic group at University College London and a policy think-tank working on issues of ageing and longevity (the International Longevity Centre - UK), and will clarify these relationships using data from large cohorts of older adults from England using the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing and corresponding cohorts in mainland Europe and India.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We anticipate that findings from this study will help policy makers and practitioners develop policies and interventions that can help improve well-being in older age groups.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>There are a number of beneficiaries of this research on whom the impact of the proposed work will be apparent. These include:

i) Policy makers: The research questions addressed in this project have been identified through discussion with the International Longevity Centre-UK, a policy think tank, with the explicit intention to ensure the results are policy relevant. We intend that the findings will be relevant not only to ILC-UK, but to policy makers in national and local government as well. They will contribute to the current debates on measures of well-being and its determinants that are taking place both in the UK and internationally. The measures included in the ONS national programme and more widely in OECD initiatives are only the first stage towards understanding and improving the well-being of the population. By identifying specific aspects of social connections that are relevant to well-being in older adults, our findings will be useful in targeting levers for change, and directing policies and initiatives to improve well-being in older adults. This is particularly relevant for an issue such as well-being since a sizable proportion of the variance is likely to be due to genetic factors and structural aspects of society that are difficult to ameliorate, placing greater emphasis on those determinants of well-being that are malleable.

ii) Third-sector organisations: Several voluntary sector organisations and charities have recognised the problem of sustaining well-being in the elderly and the high risk of social exclusion in this group. These include Age UK and the AGE Platform Europe, both of which have highlighted the need for high quality research to support policy and lobbying activities. We anticipate that our findings will contribute to their work, and will help them develop programmes for older adults.

iii) Practitioners: Our findings will be valuable to social and health professionals, carers and volunteers who work with older adults, helping them identify individuals at risk and provide them with appropriate support. If certain types of social connection prove to be particularly valuable in terms of maintaining well-being, it may be possible to target these activities more precisely, and ensure that resources are focused more effectively

iv) Older adults: Not least, the findings will help identify the kinds of social connections that are most beneficial to older people. Many older men and women make substantial social, cultural and economic contributions, and these may be enhanced by measures that improve their health and functional status. Research on social connections and well-being may identify new ways of promoting these goals.

Our work with the ILC-UK will ensure dissemination of these findings at the highest levels of policy-making in the UK and the EU. As ILC-UK is part of the Global Alliance of Longevity Centres, we will also be able to disseminate these findings more widely.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-03</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-03-04</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>142375</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The Emotional Wellbeing of Older Carers</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>99FAD9BB-C957-4923-B9DA-93A91F02E20B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A workshop was held in collaboration with the International Longevity Centre UK on the issue of the emotional wellbeing of older carers.

Our work on social isolation and loneliness, in particular the findings with relation to mortality, have received considerable attention in the press and have contributed to the debates on the role of different dimensions of social relationships in health and wellbeing. 
? The Special Health &amp;amp; Wellbeing Forum hosted in conjunction with ILC-UK and Lewisham Pensioners Forum offered a useful opportunity to engage with older adults on an area of direct relevance to them. During the course of forum activities, we presented findings from our work and attendees were asked to consider the role of social networks in their life, different ways in which they could develop and maintain social relationships and the challenges they faced in doing the same. Attendees were involved in extension discussion around the topic and were keen on obtaining further information regarding our research findings. 
? We will shortly be releasing a series of policy reports and having a launch event of our findings aimed at policy makers.</gtr:description><gtr:id>9E0F4945-8810-4360-AB4A-30595C0B06DF</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5462418a743ae9.91081827</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This grant aimed at understanding the association between social relationships and wellbeing in older adults, using data from England, across Europe and India. Below we summarise findings with respect to our main research questions: 

Dimensions of social relationships and wellbeing 
? Our research shows that different social networks dimensions may have varying effects on measures of wellbeing. In analysis of data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), we found that having a number of close ties and frequent contact with family and friends was associated with greater life satisfaction and a better quality of life over a 6-year period. Merely having a large number of contacts was, however, not associated with improved wellbeing. 
? In an analysis using data from ELSA, we examined the role of social isolation and loneliness memory and recall. Our analysis showed that both isolation and loneliness were associated with poorer memory and recall over a 4 year period. 
? In an analysis using data from ELSA, we examined the role of social isolation and loneliness on objective physical function (walking speed) and self-reported disability. Our analysis showed that while social isolation was associated with poorer objective physical functioning, loneliness was associated with higher levels of disability.
? In analysis examining social isolation and loneliness from wave 2 of ELSA to predict survival (mean follow-up = 7.25 years), we found that following adjustment for a range of covariates including demographic variables and health status, being highly isolated was associated with a 26% increase in the hazard of death but being lonely did not independently lead to higher mortality.
? In cross-sectional analyses comparing data from England and India (2010/11), we found that loneliness was associated with lower life satisfaction in both countries but the association as more marked in the case of England suggesting differences in cultural meanings attached to loneliness. 

At-risk groups
? We examined transitions in caregiving status over a 2 year period using ELSA. We found that women who continued to be caregivers over this period reported a decline in quality of life. Women who stopped being caregivers over this time reported higher levels of depression. Neither effect was seen among men. 
? Among individuals who were highly isolated (those who report none or only 1 social connection) a fairly high proportion (46%) report never being lonely. Women, those of a lower socioeconomic status, individuals who scored higher on neuroticism and those who believed they had less control over situations at home were more likely to report being lonely some or all of the time. This indicates the role of stable personality characteristics on persistent loneliness in the isolated. 

Changes in wellbeing and social connections
? Using data from ELSA, we analysed the associations between social isolation and loneliness at baseline (wave 2) and enjoyment of life and life satisfaction over a 6-year period. Wellbeing showed a U-shaped relationship with time. Both isolation and loneliness were associated with smaller increases in life satisfaction over time. Social isolation was also associated with sustained decreases in enjoyment of life over time.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In line with our Pathways to Impact statement, we believe that our findings:
? Offer useful distinctions between different conceptualisations of social relationship and help identify which may be most important to different dimensions of wellbeing. We believe this is of use to various national and international level organisations involved in the measurement of wellbeing. 
? Suggest important cultural differences in ways in which some dimensions of social relationships may be perceived and could hence guide future cross-national comparisons. 
? Provide a valuable evidence base indicating the need for a more nuanced approach towards understanding social relationships and wellbeing in older age. Our project partner, the International Longevity Centre-UK, has ensured that the work remains policy relevant. We will be releasing a series of reports based on our work and launching these at a formal event aimed at policy makers. 
? Help practitioners such as doctors, nurses and care-workers who need to identify individuals at greatest risk of poor outcomes. 
? Help older adults consider the importance of social connections in their lives, and consider ways in which they could develop and maintain better social relationships so as to ensure greater wellbeing. 
? Academic beneficiaries include social science researchers interested in the role of social networks and wellbeing, health researchers, economists who work on measurement and determinants of wellbeing and social policy researchers who are interested in policy changes to improve wellbeing.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>713D1F7D-B27C-44FA-9699-F8A47A85D585</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544f92d6c48ca5.94229128</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>859E74A5-0097-4B86-B7B2-842FBDCCDC50</gtr:id><gtr:title>Informal caregiving transitions, subjective well-being and depressed mood: Findings from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Aging &amp;
