The isoperimetric problem falls into this category: among all the geometric shapes in the plane with the same area, which one has the smallest perimeter? This question is so natural and old that it was referred to even by Virgil in the Aeneid, in the 1st century BC. Despite this fact, a satisfactory and mathematically sound solution to this problem was found only in 1958, when Ennio De Giorgi proved that there is just one geometric shape with this property: the disk. A crucial step in De Giorgi's argument consists in showing that the solution of the problem exhibits certain symmetries. Indeed, once we are given this piece of information, we can focus on a very restricted class of geometric shapes, and this easily allows to conclude the proof. More generally, a fundamental question arising in many problems in calculus of variations is the following: 

QUESTION 1: Are minimisers symmetric (in some sense)?
 
The first goal of this project is to answer the question above for some important variational problems related to isoperimetric and functional inequalities. To this aim, we will take advantage of the successful approach recently adopted by the PI and his collaborators in the study of Steiner's and Ehrhard's inequality, where necessary and sufficient conditions for the symmetry of minimisers are given, in terms of the new notion of &amp;quot;essential connectedness&amp;quot;. This notion explains what it means for a Borel set to disconnect another Borel set, and turns out to be crucial for a clear understanding of the aforementioned problems. 

Once the symmetry of minimisers has carefully been investigated, a second important question arises:

QUESTION 2: Is it possible to &amp;quot;measure&amp;quot; in some way the asymmetry of those competitors that are &amp;quot;almost&amp;quot; minimisers?

For the isoperimetric problem, this second question can be formulated in the following way: suppose there is a geometric shape in the plane, whose perimeter is &amp;quot;close&amp;quot; to the perimeter of the disk. Can we say that such geometric shape is &amp;quot;almost&amp;quot; a disk? In 2008 Nicola Fusco, Francesco Maggi, and Aldo Pratelli gave a positive answer to this question, proving what is now referred to as the &amp;quot;quantitative isoperimetric inequality&amp;quot;. This gives a precise estimate of how far from being a disk a geometric shape is, in terms of its perimeter. In recent years, quantitative inequalities have attracted the attention of a large number of mathematicians. This is because such inequalities not only imply stability of minimisers, but also give detailed nformation about competitors whose energy is close to the minimum value. 

The second goal of this project is to prove, in the same spirit of what was done by Fusco, Maggi and Pratelli, a quantitative version of important isoperimetric and functional inequalities. These include, for instance, P&amp;oacute;lya-Szeg&amp;ouml; type inequalities, which have applications in several areas of mathematical analysis, such as harmonic analysis, spectral theory of differential operators, theory of Sobolev spaces, and PDEs.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The primary impact of the project will be mainly academic. In particular, the large international community of calculus of variations
will benefit of the tools that will be studied and introduced. Among these, in the UK we can include the departments of mathematics 
of the University of Bristol, University of Cambridge, University of Oxford. Other international departments that might have an interest on the findings of the project are those of Carnegie Mellon University (Pittsburgh, USA), University of K&amp;ouml;ln (Germany), Technical University of Munich (Germany), University of Texas at Austin (USA), University of Z&amp;uuml;rich (Switzerland). A workshop will be hosted at Sussex, where the main experts of the field will be invited to discuss cutting-edge research, and interaction and future collaborations will be encouraged. 

Besides the academic impact, special attention will be devoted to inspiring new generations of mathematicians. This project is particularly timely, considering that in the official HM Treasury Budget 2016 it is explained that the government will &amp;quot;ask Professor Sir Adrian Smith to review the case for how to improve the study of maths from 16 to 18, to ensure the future workforce is skilled and competitive, including looking at the case and feasibility 
for more or all students continuing to study maths to 18, in the longer-term&amp;quot;. For this reason, the PI will use his past experience as Outreach Officer, 
and his actual role as Admissions Tutor in the department of Mathematics at Sussex. The PI will pay visits to local sixth forms and London schools, 
and will deliver public talks directed to the broader public, together with local initiatives such as &amp;quot;Nerd Nite Brighton&amp;quot;. 

For this project in specific the PI aims to raise awareness of how the complexity of calculus of variations can actually have implications for the understanding of everyday phenomena. To this aim, the PI will also use some of the equipment already available in the department ofathematics at Sussex (such as soap bubble frames, to explain minimal surfaces, etc.). 

This project will build the PI's capacity in the future to lead a research group in the field of calculus of variations, by enhancing his scientific expertise.
At the same time, it will allow his broader professional skill set (i.e. project management, communication and networking skills) to develop.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>101104</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P007287/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>04D8FF87-2CFC-44E7-A7DF-47E10C813E05</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical Analysis</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
