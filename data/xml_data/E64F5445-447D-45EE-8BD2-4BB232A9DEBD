Equality)</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/P014232/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>In recent years there have been significant advances made internationally to raise awareness about gender inequalities. International organisations including the United Nations have also sought to ensure that the creation of more equitable futures for women and men are at the heart of global change and sustainable development. Despite those advances, gender inequalities persist in myriad forms and negatively affect the health and wellbeing of people the world over in a variety of ways, from constraining access to opportunities and resources to fostering gender based violence. We recognise the importance of both international bodies and national states and governments in agenda setting, enacting progressive legislation and adopting gender positive policies, as well as the work of those political activists who are at the forefront of pressing for these changes. However, this project is focused on the way that cultures of equality are being built and created from the ground up. We do so by investigating the creative ways that people and organisations in developing countries respond to and seek to address existing inequalities and enhance the wellbeing of people marginalised as a result of those. Our aim is disclose the ways that those everyday responses not only address harms, but also become opportunities for broader societal impact through creating new and alternative cultures of equality.
 
How and in what ways does the proposed research use art, curation, literature and performance to address these challenges? Our answer, following the novelist Jeanette Winterson, is that, 'Everything starts as a story we tell ourselves about ourselves'. By that Winterson means that so long as we remain capable of telling different stories about our own and other lives, there is the possibility of creating more equitable and sustainable futures for all of us. That is our understanding of what cultures of equality are about: working with and alongside people both to disclose the situations of inequality and the bodily and mental impacts of that on them and the people they care for, and to begin to tell different stories about what their lives ought and could be. As scholars working across the humanities and social sciences we think there are considerable advantages to using different arts based practice including creative writing, dance, exhibitions, music, theatre, performance or social media in this process. These different multisensory methods enable people to share things about their lives that may be too sensitive and threatening to talk about directly. They also create opportunities not just to tell different stories but also to tell them in new and different sorts of ways. Our project draws together and creates new partnerships between people and organisations from across the world in and beyond the academy. In so doing we will share expertise and learn from each other about how we can best use these arts based research practices, both to enable us to better hear and understand the stories people tell, and to find better ways of using those stories to create the conditions that underpin and will enhance the economic development and welfare of all people.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project is concerned with the development, welfare and wellbeing of people in lower income countries who are marginalised by a range of intersecting gender inequalities. Through art events and exhibitions we seek to make visible the embodied experiences of those intersecting forms of inequality and their impact on people's wellbeing, broadly conceived, and demonstrate how these situations of marginality may become sites for challenging social divisions and producing new cultures of equality.
 
1. Marginalised people in DAC listed lower - middle income countries 
The first beneficiaries of our work will be the people who participate as co-curators in the community based art events. Participating in performative events and curating visual images will afford people opportunity to creatively convey something of the everyday and embodied impacts of intersecting inequalities on their wellbeing, reflect on the key issues or interventions that might enhance their situation and enable them to make visible the way that their own work and lives contribute to making cultures of equality otherwise.

2. Project Partners and Community Based Organisations
The participation of third sector organisations in planning the research and contributing to community based art events will both encourage, and provide models for, an expanded use of art and other performative events to stimulate critical conversations about the relation between gender and development, wellbeing and the production of cultures of equality. These may then be extended to other similar community based organisations. The events aim also to increase investment in, and participation of marginalised people, in the work of these civic organisations that provide vital welfare services for their constituents but frequently struggle to find the resources needed to continue their work. 

3. Policy Makers and Advocacy Groups
The principle benefits for policy makers and advocacy groups are threefold: 
a) an enhanced awareness of the relation between intersecting inequalities and diminished wellbeing; 
b) better appreciation of the way that NGOs and other project partners are meeting the welfare needs of marginalised peoples and pressing for changes to address the underlying issues of inequality; and 
c) an opportunity to consider whether, and if so how, official equalities discourse may be critiqued and extended through engagement and encounter with alternative visions and versions of equality.
 
4. Impact on arts practitioners &amp;amp; museums 
The exhibitions and events will include curated images, sound and text from the community arts based projects. Together the events and exhibitions will encourage art practitioners to consider how and in what ways visual and performing arts might become involved in dialogues about gender, wellbeing and development. More broadly this project proposes an alternative to how anthropological museums and exhibitions deal with contemporary forms of diversity issues: usually objects from the stores, dealing with the lives of past peoples. Our project will encourage museums and galleries to consider their role in dialogues about contemporary development and to reflect on ways that they might practically become sites for the production of cultures of equality.

5. General public impact
Wide public engagement at the exhibitions, workshops, discussions held as part of this project, as well as through digital forms of dissemination and dialogue, is seen as an essential element of this project. That includes, but is not limited to, the planned Global Museum of Equalities and the GlobalGRACE open access online course. Our aim is to raise public interest in and awareness about the relations between intersecting inequalities and diminished wellbeing, and encourage better appreciation and understanding of the creative cultural practices that enable people to overcome the obstacles they face in sustaining their lives.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>3287886</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/P014232/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>38E9B207-EFC4-4B48-AF70-C67AC5978934</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Drama &amp; theatre studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3367A4B0-EBD4-4FD9-8351-3A2F206BD2AF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Anthropology and Development</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>62F4842F-55F4-41C6-A77A-572005E91429</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Community Art inc A &amp; H</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>51073B72-B972-4034-A0A1-87A6B0DCD198</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Museum &amp; Gallery Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9BB7B92A-CA2F-416A-8A6C-ED65BF575E45</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Performance &amp; Live Art</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>33A50DE3-0023-4F8B-810C-F0B929F9218F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Womens and Gender Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>D640D1B8-B141-4DFC-BCD3-CEADD848A918</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>GCRF</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
