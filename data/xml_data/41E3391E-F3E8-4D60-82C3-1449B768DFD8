Indeed, it has been reported that European RTE foods are frequently contaminated with pathogenic organisms. In order to enhance the safety of these foods, and at the same time prevent the heat-induced physicochemical and nutritional changes, novel, non-thermal processes will be developed and optimised. Photosensitization will reduce the contamination level of pathogens in RTE vegetable and fruit salads raw materials and packaging. Pulsed Electric Fields technologies and/or semi-continuous High Pressure Homogenization (in egg and/or dairy based products and ingredients) will be compared in terms of pathogens inactivation, microbiological quality and changes of the properties of proteins as well as food microstructure and rheology for fluid foods. The ability of the latter technology to activate naturally occurring or exogenous enzymes will be exploited in order to generate new bioactive natural food components. High Hydrostatic Pressure will be applied to RTE meals of vegetable origin packaged under CO2 atmosphere in comparison and in addition to traditional mild heat treatments. The optimisation of the formulation of the meals and the treatment specifications will be performed taking into consideration nutritional aspects (salt, lipid contents), the possible physicochemical and structural changes induced by the processes and the specific requirements of the various process technologies in terms of physical state and rheology (appropriate viscosity, particles presence and size etc.) In addition, the kinetics of inactivation and re-growth of pathogens will be evaluated by deliberately inoculating pathogens and will be incorporated into a quantitative risk assessment to determine the appropriate treatments required in relation to the shelf- life of each product.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_PROJECTED</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>139624</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Better microbial characterisation of new food processing technologies, leading to improved food safety.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2007</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>93D4B189-2848-43A9-99BF-BF0BFDD2EFC9</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5448d0799c0ae6.71547813</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>New data were generated on the kinetics of inactivation with &amp;quot;innovative technologies &amp;quot;; and subsequent growth of food pathogens . In general the modelling of inactivation of &amp;quot;emerging&amp;quot; technology is still in its infancy. This may be in part because these technologies are expensive to implement and experiments are costly but which factor influence the inactivation processes and how have emerged from the project. In addition, Quantitative Microbiological Risk assessments (QMRA) were carried out with specific products:

Inactivation by photosensitization of Listeria monocytogenes on tomatoes

Inactivation of Listeria monocytogenes in whole UHT milk by heat, High Pressure Homogeinization (HPH) (with lab scale equipment) and pulsed electric field (PEF) combined with heat and subsequent growth at fridge temperature.

Inactivation of Salmonella typhimurium in egg by HPH (with lab scale equipment) and PEF combined with heat and subsequent growth at 10&amp;deg;C.

Inactivation by HPH (at industrial scale) and heat treatment and subsequent growth of different pathogens in soup

Growth of Listeria monocytogenes at 10&amp;deg;C in grilled red pepper after inactivation by High Hydrostatic Pressure and CO2 and heat treatment.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings should be built in predictive software packages</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0405C1F4-12AC-4FD5-8964-104694843509</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-9502748362.256917748c756</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5B013D5A-D157-4C3C-92AD-D0F96B467102</gtr:id><gtr:title>Modelling the photosensitization-based inactivation of Bacillus cereus.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of applied microbiology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2ab3b5e6e7202964287e8f9eead536ff"><gtr:id>2ab3b5e6e7202964287e8f9eead536ff</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Marc YL</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1364-5072</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>544675300a9707.05829118</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BBS/E/F/00042105</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
