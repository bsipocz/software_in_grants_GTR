However, the deformation behaviour of small volumes of material is not well understood, in particular the effect of the measured hardness increasing as the size of the indentation (and hence of the volume of materials deformed) decreases. Our interdisciplinary approach to this problem is unique internationally and uses techniques and concepts developed in semiconductor technology to solve fundamental problems in materials science and metallurgy.The key aims are to unify the very different theories that are used to explain the mechanical strength of nanostructures in different contexts. Critical thickness theory is highly developed as a way to understand the strained layers used in semiconductor technology. Strain gradient theory has been developed to explain the size effect in which small stressed volumes appear to be stronger. The work at QMUL has introduced two new concepts. The first is that the initiation of plasticity starts throughout a finite minimum volume. The second is that there is a minimum rate of relief of elastic strain energy required to initiate plasticity. These four ideas are undoubtedly different expressions of a single underlying principle, and our central aim in this proposal is to identify that principle through experiment and theoretical development.At Queen Mary, we will design structures to be grown at the Central Facility in Sheffield. We will carry out mechanical tests - nanoindentation, bending, at room temperature and high temperature - and we will use the results to guide theory. Through collaborators at Cambridge, we have access to unique facilities for looking at, for example, the material under a one-micron indent. Through collaborators in industry, we have access to the latest Xray techniques, for analysing, for example, the strains in a bent beam specimen.The total cost of the programme will be about 600000. This is worthwhile and timely since Nanoscale applications need to be underpinned by fundamental research in materials, where EPSRC observe that there are rich new areas for uncovering novel materials behaviour. This proposal falls under the themes of Nanostructured materials, and Materials phenomena and properties, in EPSRC's research priorities.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>106930</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>700000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>European Union (EU)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>EUR</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>Austria</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>de_AT</gtr:currLang><gtr:department>Seventh Framework Programme (FP7)</gtr:department><gtr:description>Accelerated Metallurgy (ACCMET)</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-02-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>European Commission</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>263206</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>FC3DB2B5-62E6-4B7F-92F4-B03628605501</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544ec91b016956.36346658</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-03-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>77009</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Building New Capability in Structural Ceramics</gtr:description><gtr:end>2013-06-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>EP/F033605/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>BC3FB4A1-1F29-48CE-9BE9-42695EC35173</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544f7903276c91.25969822</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2008-07-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>109605</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>European Union (EU)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:department>Seventh Framework Programme (FP7)</gtr:department><gtr:description>HiTempProp</gtr:description><gtr:end>2013-03-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>European Commission</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>252520</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>915547F0-DF8E-4EA5-A1C9-AB33AE30F379</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544eca12988f81.25699703</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>9469808</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Doctoral Training Partnership(DTP) in Structural Metallic Systems for Gas Turbine Applications-Universities of Cambridge,Swansea and Birmingham</gtr:description><gtr:end>2014-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>EP/H022309/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>30FD390E-0479-42C9-8BAA-F7BCAF1C359A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544ecadbd20fb3.03015116</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2009-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>2740824</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Structural Metallic Systems For Advanced Gas Turbine Applications</gtr:description><gtr:end>2014-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>EP/H500375/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>FBA4F000-7FBD-42F9-95AD-ECA08C3D6D32</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544ecb878bb781.87135070</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2009-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The observation that the micropillars could be plastically deformed without cracking led to the micropillar compression being investigated as a technique for studying plasticity in brittle materials without the requirement for high confining pressures.

While there must inevitably be a scale at which this happens, for instance as the sample size approaches the activation volume, the sample sizes here tended to be larger than this. An assumption of the initial analysis was that the yield stress did not vary with the In concentration in the layers. To investigate this, films of InGaAs were made with varying In concentrations. Using spherical indentation to determine the onset of yield, it was shown that both the elastic modulus and yield stress were influenced by the In concentration and that this assumption was incorrect.



The deformation of the multilayers was studied using spherical indentation. Similar results were obtained to those at QMUL. An essential point of the initial analysis was that the onset of deformation should occur in a volume extending further than a single layer thickness. However this proved impossible to see by examining the sample in the electron microscope after it had been deformed. Micropillar compression and nanoindentation experiments in the transmission electron microscope were therefore carried out at the National Centre for Electron Microscopy at L.B.N.L. in Berkeley, California. These showed that deformation was more prevalent in the weaker layer. Based on these results, a straightforward analysis to be developed, using the information gathered on the effect of In on the yield stress, where the yield pressure of the multilayer is related to the onset of flow in the weaker layer determined by both its intrinsic yield pressure and coherency strains. This gave good agreement both with our observations and with the previous experimental observations obtained elsewhere, as well as being consistent with the observations of the effects of internal stresses in films in the literature.



The observation that the micropillars could be plastically deformed without cracking led to the micropillar compression being investigated as a technique for studying plasticity in brittle materials without the requirement for high confining pressures. Work, in collaboration with the group of J.

Normally such materials would break rather than plastically deform. However, the plastic flow behaviour can be of great importance both at low and high temperatures in structural applications, in hard coatings for cutting tools and even in electronic materials. This work is now being developed in a range of other projects, some with industrial funding and others with academics in the UK, Europe and the US.

The development of small-scale test techniques has, more recently, been used to study deformation in diamond, in collaboration with Element 6, whose main research centre moved from South Africa to Harwell in 2013. There has also been work studying the deformation of hard coatings in collaboration with the Singapore Institute for Manufacturing Technology (SIMTech). This has led to coatings being made, where recent work has shown that plastic flow requires dislocations to be nucleated within each 10 nm grain, giving rise to great improvements in wear resistance.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A9AC49F0-DA51-4139-BAF8-71F97BEDE93F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-4562435089.2030037747d940</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Energy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0F558FFD-9144-4158-8F0E-C5903D1C7D91</gtr:id><gtr:title>Discontinuous yield in InGaAs thin films</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Surface and Coatings Technology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c84a557646e13fdd5ec7e06f4229e273"><gtr:id>c84a557646e13fdd5ec7e06f4229e273</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Korte S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2008-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>544ed4c0957e14.82922102</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B0C2481E-9B05-432F-8186-0D534865EFBA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Micropillar compression of ceramics at elevated temperatures</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Scripta Materialia</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c84a557646e13fdd5ec7e06f4229e273"><gtr:id>c84a557646e13fdd5ec7e06f4229e273</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Korte S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>544ed19a790d14.66802451</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B05F3BDB-41BC-4807-B8BA-CDC91750D740</gtr:id><gtr:title>Deformation of silicon - Insights from microcompression testing at 25-500&amp;deg;C</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>International Journal of Plasticity</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c84a557646e13fdd5ec7e06f4229e273"><gtr:id>c84a557646e13fdd5ec7e06f4229e273</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Korte S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0749-6419</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a35196532b4a8.01024956</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>09575557-7993-4B59-9554-28889B6340F2</gtr:id><gtr:title>Fracture modes in micropillar compression of brittle crystals</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Materials Research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5f9269864790b3d91214b555d7f4200b"><gtr:id>5f9269864790b3d91214b555d7f4200b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Howie P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>544f7f71eb1f12.29738695</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>12D87F16-4979-4474-BF8F-9196DB41FAB7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Ductile-brittle transition in micropillar compression of GaAs at room temperature</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Philosophical Magazine</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/fefc3f820fd88fc606d074c88dfaa28e"><gtr:id>fefc3f820fd88fc606d074c88dfaa28e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>?stlund F</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>544ed27e3cbf79.74525497</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B5FE9FD7-E3F5-476E-8529-CD41BD45A431</gtr:id><gtr:title>Discussion of the dependence of the effect of size on the yield stress in hard materials studied by microcompression of MgO</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Philosophical Magazine</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c84a557646e13fdd5ec7e06f4229e273"><gtr:id>c84a557646e13fdd5ec7e06f4229e273</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Korte S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>544ed1dae1fbc8.83397869</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BDD33EBF-9626-4AAC-BFA6-EA33D172F09D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Onset of plasticity in InxGa1-xAs multilayers</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Acta Materialia</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c84a557646e13fdd5ec7e06f4229e273"><gtr:id>c84a557646e13fdd5ec7e06f4229e273</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Korte S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>544ed47acbaba2.73139492</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AC28CFC0-C373-425E-861F-FF64C14DBE88</gtr:id><gtr:title>Elastic and plastic properties of In
