electrolytes</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/N020707/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Li-stuffed garnet electrolytes are poised to provide a breakthrough in battery technology since they can deliver the adequate Li-conductivity and the safety and cycle life required for the commercialisation of high-energy density batteries (i.e. high voltage Li-ion and Li-metal batteries). However, these garnet electrolytes, if they are not processed properly, suffer from severe moisture-sensitivity that leads to drastic degradation of their transport and microstructural properties - a problem that has not been universally recognised in the field. This fast degradation, which occurs even at room temperature, has so far hindered fundamental studies aimed at identifying and optimising the modes of lithium transport within the crystal lattice and the grain boundaries. Furthermore, measurements of the interfacial resistances reflect those of the decomposition products, rather than the intrinsic properties of the garnets themselves. We have developed a unique t setup that will allow a strict control of the moisture during the processing and characterization of the garnets. Our work, to date, has shown a three-fold enhancement in lithium-ion conductivity, if the degradation-related problems are addressed. The aim of this project is threefold: a) Reveal the optimum intrinsic Li-mobility in Li7-nxAxV(n-1)xLa3Zr2O12 (V = lithium vacancy) garnets b) Investigate the electrode/garnet interfaces and c) Analyse the degradation under moisture-controlled conditions to evaluate the potential use of the garnets in Li-air cells.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The development of safe, long life, high energy density secondary batteries is one of the most important challenges in materials science towards safeguarding quality of life for future generations. On the one hand, it will reduce fossil fuel dependency and its associated greenhouse gas emission levels, helping to fulfill targets set by the Climate Change Act for the UK to cut its emissions by at least 80% from 1990 levels by 2050. On the other hand, the successful realisation of such high capacity batteries will allow the production of long-range electric transport requiring mobile storage and release of electrical energy and will support the utilization of green power sources more efficiently for stationary applications. Solid electrolytes such as lithium-conducting garnet ceramic oxides have the potential to provide the breakthrough in battery technology that we seek since they are able to deliver the required safety and stability properties. However, there are some aspects relating to the adequate understanding of Li-conduction paths and degradation processes in these systems that remain unknown, hindering their optimization and integration in commercial batteries. This project represents a unique and timely opportunity to unveil the intrinsic Li conductivity in garnets and to understand and improve the interfacial resistance of the solid electrolyte/electrode interfaces. It will provide invaluable information for optimising the Li-conduction pathways in these materials that will allow the design and production of the best possible ceramic electrolytes to be used in secondary batteries. Furthermore, the project aims to establish a universal procedure for the suitable processing of Li-ceramics that will prevent their degradation and optimise their performance in batteries (i.e. via tuning of the microstructural and electrochemical properties). This will not only have a great impact on the knowledge of these complex and interesting systems but also has potential economic benefits through the introduction of procedures for the commercialization of solid state batteries.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>98536</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>MIT Seed Fund</gtr:description><gtr:id>1B65E881-722A-4F9F-822B-EC79842D217F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>So far we have developed a protocol for in-situ characterization of the cathode/electrolyte interfaces under Temperature and bias</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6ba39d2c1a6.85662008-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>At MIT the gorth by sputtering the cathodes on the garnet electrolyte and measure high pressure XPS and XANES in synchrotron facilities at USA</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We have established a collaboration to look at cathode-garnet electrolyte interfaces. at Imperial we provide with the garnet electrolyte and analyse the surface and interfacial chemical properties by using surface analysis techniques</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The main discoveries achieve so far with this grant have been:

- Garnet oxides with high Li-conductivity (&amp;gt;10-5 S/cm) quickly react with moisture and CO2 forming secondary phases and degradation layers that can hugely affect the electrochemical performance of this systems in a secondary battery
- The degradation layer has a thickness of around 2 micrometers and seems to act as a passivation layer preventing further degradation
- Degradation-free garnets can be obtained by synthesizing and processing the materials under strict control of moisture and CO2 (Ar-filled glove box)
- We have performed isotopic labeling experiments with D2O to evaluate the kinetics for the degradation reaction and the mobility of the protonic species in the garnet structure. We have observed that chemical diffusion coefficients of around 10-13 cm2/s can be obtained what suggest a mobility of D similar to that expected for Li at the same temperature
- We are evaluating different ways to analyse the Li exchange kinetics and Li diffusion in different Liquid/solid and solid/solid interfaces using garnet electrolytes</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The integration of garnet electrolytes in secondary battery systems can promote the development of safer and higher energy density batteries. However, so far, all the literature is very controversial and is still not clear what are the factors affecting the low performance observed so far en garnet-based battery systems. With this study we are showing the importance of controlling very well parameters such as synthesis and processing conditions to prevent chemical inhomogeneiteis in garnets that can promote early degradation when working in a battery. This study is fundamental to understand these complicated systems and improve their performance in different secondary battery systems.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>3E84EFC7-53B6-4AA4-ABBF-B318645870CD</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c13f1c8152b8.83041172</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Energy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/N020707/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F95121C7-7C31-40CE-BDBC-1E2BF025AEA6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Energy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>97AD4D1C-4499-4C7E-AF8A-FE9EFE56E306</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Energy Storage</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
