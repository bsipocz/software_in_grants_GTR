Marks Hall near Coggeshall, Essex, is one of the lost mansions of Britain. It is a site that offers exciting opportunities for exploring the reconstruction of heritage and its educational and recreational appeal. During the twentieth century, Britain lost a third of its greatest country houses. Hundreds of mansions were pulled down because proprietors could no longer afford to maintain or repair them. Many houses were lost in the straitened decade of the 1950s, following wartime damage. Essex alone lost more than 100 mansions between 1946 and 1966.&amp;nbsp; The project will offer a virtual recreation including innovative conservation and planting. It will digitally recreate the original walls and architectural features, using hundreds of photographs, and integrate new displays, exhibits, holographic interpretations, university learning resources, community open days and archaeological digs, a new guide book and academic study of the whole project. A workshop and public policy forum on lost houses and historical memory will be held in May 2013, followed by an international conference on lost country houses in July.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project will benefit Marks Hall Trust, members of the local community, visitors from further afield, heritage organisations (with links already in place to the National Trust and the Royal Horticultural Society), local schools, local history and archaeological groups and local and regional government officials among others.

The charitable Marks Hall Trust will gain a major attraction of national and international importance, showcasing the interaction between academic research and community involvement - notably through an oral history project and community involvement in archaeological investigation and training. The exploration of local histories such as that of post-war housing, the demolition of great houses and the conflicting testimony of witness will all inform debate (projected by an open forum and a conference). The Trust will also benefit economically via the estimated doubling in number of visitors that will occur (in line with the DEFRA-appointed Trustees' strategic objective). Staff at Marks Hall will increase their experience and have access to academic expertise and contribute to the development of a new permanent website that they will maintain beyond the award period.

The project will also inform debate on issues such as community, leisure, tourism and rural regeneration which feature heavily in local and regional government policy objectives: see for example the Braintree District Council Affordable Housing Strategy 2009-14, Essex Development and Regeneration Agency, Essex County Council's 'Heritage Conservation Policy' and 'Essex Rural Partnership'. The project will also provide historical context to public policy decisions, such as emergency housing and planning consents.

Local residents and visitors from further afield alike, will benefit from the multi-faceted redesign and regeneration of the lost mansion site. Local residents in particular will benefit from improved local recreational and educational amenities which will be created and from the sense of local community identity and place generated by this civic engagement project. The emphasis on volunteerism will provide opportunities develop skills by gaining a 'hands-on understanding' of the site for those interested in archaeology as will the conservation and interpretation of features displaying lost craftsmanship and building techniques. They will also have access to training opportunities such as the Certificate of Continuing Education in Local Historical Studies. 
 
Visitors will also be able to help shape the project by providing feedback during its lifetime. For example, it will be possible to make on-site videos of visitors' reactions (including by children). Those interested in website design and holographic installation and digital interpretation will also benefit.

Students will benefit from the inclusion of placements, internships and training, which will increase their employability by providing excellent training and skills development for future heritage, tourist management or like careers.

Local history groups and archaeological groups will receive significant new interest and training and involvement in the project, boosting their membership numbers and experience.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-11-15</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-07-16</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>74725</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>See Full 90pp Report submitted in January 2014</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>7C39F1FB-3038-4BD6-9F3E-38BFF076F42E</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d958bf3de457.51547148</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Creative Economy,Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Interpretation of the dig has exceeded all expectations. In addition to recovering the outline of the Jacobean mansion (destroyed in 1950) the sites of the Tudor and medieval houses have now been uncovered, recorded and plotted (and will shortly be on the project website and facebook page). An eleventh-century great hearth has been revealed (the finest in the region) and further walls and drains. Two outstanding cisterns have now been given smart reconstructed brick domes by local students. We maintain a fascinating account of building in stages from Domesday onwards. Among notable finds is perhaps the finest and largest Neolithic (c 4,000BC) flint tool found in Essex and rivalling only one other in East Anglia. The story of continued occupancy of this site in a manor house/mansion is probably now the fullest in Essex in archaeological terms and the digging will continue into a further season, with further courses and community dig days and opportunities for internships. We are also advancing a major HLF bid for a new visitor centre to show off the remains (including the recovery of the original mansion staircase, rescued from mid Suffolk where it went in 1950) . 5 pamphlets and a school pack have been prepared, 2 books are in process, the international conference and public policy day have attracted great attention,. press coverage has been sustained (and included the visit from the Australian High Commissioner) and we have had excellent feedback from visitors to the site. The travelling exhibitions were a great success - many objects were also donated - and Jane Pearson's oral history work was showcased along with digital and videoed models. The 'drain-cam' - of photographs taken from the moving video camera down the uncovered Tudor drain was a particular success and hit with the public.

John Mallinson will give an account of the history as uncovered at an event planned for June to which all are welcome.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>As a visitor attraction, local heritage and tourism industries, recreation, digital application study in the community,. community involvement in archaeology, oral history involvement, local planning in relation to visitor centres and the exploitation and interpretation of local heritage and a major archaeological site, Facebook, twitter, webpage, visitor guide books, books (academic and general) radio and TV interviews, travelling exhibitions, international conference and public policy days, community digs and other public events.,</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A8A9F683-4AA8-4507-834C-6D0ECE3282B5</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-3128066233.4785487775780a</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.facebook.com/markshallmansion</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/J020516/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Archaeology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>48433216-63E8-4CF1-9DCA-EB8E156B6265</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Archaeology of Literate Soc.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DCE73056-5E3D-4976-B573-234E5FF4D633</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic &amp; Social History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AD75E543-5F70-43C2-A40D-4452373465C4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Heritage Management</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F59367AF-7012-441B-9AD6-B360A3DFA96B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Landscape &amp; Environ.
