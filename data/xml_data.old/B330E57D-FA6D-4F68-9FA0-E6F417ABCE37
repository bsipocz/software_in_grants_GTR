aims to promote partnerships and creative dialogue between leading academics and practitioners concerned with young people?s sexual health. It is prompted by the recognition that different cultures and paradigms can make it difficult for academics and practitioners to learn from each other. The seminar series aims to embrace such differences and to create dynamic dialogue to foster joint understandings. Insights generated through current theoretically informed applied social research will be examined in the light of educational and clinical issues concerning young people?s sexualities and sexual health. The seminars are:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>&amp;nbsp;competing knowledges of the young sexual body&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>&amp;nbsp;the errant body&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>&amp;nbsp;the invaded/invading body&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>&amp;nbsp;the desiring body.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>The series will critically examine key policy areas in relation to young people?s sexual bodies, including:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>contraception and reproduction&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>sexual violence and exploitation&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>sexualisation, sex and sexuality.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>A wide range of non-academic professionals and practitioners are likely to benefit from the proposed seminar series. These include: health care professionals, sex and sexual health educators; social care professionals; GPs; clinicians; youth workers; and charities and other organizations representing and/or supporting young people. Representatives from all these groups have attended a previous Sexual Health Research and Practice Conference at the University of Greenwich, and all have expressed an interest in learning about how applied social research can improve their practice. This is a key objective of the seminar series, and we have already invited a number of such practitioners as participants and speakers (as detailed in the Pathways ti Impact). Discussions will cover a number of themes including the relationships between different social and cultural contexts; young people's experiences and expectations; and the role of education in preparing young people for sexual relationships, adolescence and adulthood. 
As our case for support outlines, the seminar series will take place in a context of anxieties about the young sexual body. These anxieties incorporate fears about the growing 'sexualization' of young people, reports of sexual violence and exploitation, and continuing concerns about unintentional pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections. These are just some of the issues that practitioners, and policy-makers, are grappling with. The seminar series will address these, and other relevant, issues from academic and practitioner perspectives. The Errant Body seminar, for example, will investigate at least three key (under-researched) questions that practitioners working in contraceptive and sexual health settings are asking: why are increasing numbers of young women presenting for repeat abortions? Why are young women who do not want to become pregnant not taking emergency contraception following an incident of 'unprotected' sex? Why do so many young women have a contraceptive implant removed within one year of having it fitted? Each of the seminars has been carefully designed around a set of issues that are of concern to practitioners, and are currently being addressed in academic research. 
The series will also benefit policy-makers and commissioners as improved understandings of these issues can influence that way in which professionals and agencies design policy interventions; as well as encouraging academics to recognize policy and practical constraints in their research plans and recommendations. Outputs from the series will help agencies and practitioners develop more effective practice. Finally, the participation of the sexual health programme leaders from the University of Greenwich and Anglia Ruskin University will ensure that lessons learnt will be incorporated into sexual health practitioners' training.
Services for young people are often driven by the needs to achieve targets and prevent 'risky' sexual behaviour. Young people, however, may have different priorities and needs that can undermine much of the rationale underpinning policy and provision. The seminar series will enable discussion of innovative and flexible approaches to the exploration of the issues and needs relevant to young people. It will also facilitate collaborations between practitioners and academics that will feed into the provision of services to young people. 
The series will see the development of a web-based resource which will be widely publicised via existing academic/professional networks and which will realise the series' potential for ensuring that future research builds on existing knowledge and good practice. The results of the seminar series will also be presented as a report outlining differences, continuities and pressing issues across academic disciplines and practitioner boundaries and will be disseminated to charities, education groups, policy makers and youth organizations.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-10-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>13586</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Four short films on young women's experiences of abortion.</gtr:description><gtr:id>4DA5106D-8661-4E7A-AD44-DC61CB317E5C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>These films will form the centre piece of an abortion storytelling installation (if funded).

Several previous participants (who had not previously presented their work) presented new material at the event, and many previous participants attended the event. There was an even distribution of academics and practitioners and the event received very favourable feedback.

After the event two sub-groups were formed to take forward ideas for future collaborative research. The first on designing a contraceptive consultation model, and the second to work on abortion providers and abortion stigma. Symposium participants also decided that the Reproduction, Sexualities and Health Group at the Open University should organise an annual academic/practitioner symposium.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5655a7a099bef3.59331731</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Gender well-being and relationship cultures conference for children and teachers (year 6)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E1388232-4C28-4158-ADBB-C7F1376F0E65</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This one-day event launched the findings of a Welsh research project that explored what pre-teen children had to say about growing up as 'girls' and 'boys' in the 21st Century. One of the key findings was how angry children felt about having lived in a sexist and sexualised peer culture and society. A key aim of this conference was to provide a platform where boys and girls can have their say and learn what other children think about body image, fashion, bullying, friendships and relationships in school, in communities and online.
Workshops were run by young people (secondary school students) and facilitated by Professor Renold and PhD students focusing on gender/sexuality related topics.

Body Talk (a movement workshop with choreographer, Jen Anghared, Canolfan a Theatr Soar)
- Challenging Gender Stereotyping in Schools (Mark Jennett, Education Consultant, and Co-Ordinator of 'Breaking the Mould' project.)
- Staying safe and having fun online (Andy Phippen, University of Plymouth)
- Just good friends?: a peer-led PSE lesson on relationship cultures (with DIGON, Ysgol Plasmawr)
- Building feelings (Lego workshop on gender stereotypes in the media with FF - NEWID, Ysgol Plasmawr)
- Camping Out (Making gender feel-good shelters in a tent decorating workshop with Emma Renold)

There was also be an opportunity for researchers interested in research impact and public engagement to stay on for a roundtable after the children's conference has finished (led by Professor Emma Renold).


A key outcome of the day was to bridge the silence between children's worlds, and between children and teacher worlds. This was achieved (teacher feedback and pupil feedback)

A key outcome of the day was to enable boys and girls to discuss the pressures of gender stereotypes and combat gender and sexual bullying. This was achieved via feedback from each workshop, and in the children's comments from the 'wall of thoughts' (see pictures on the URL below)</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54624d8eca4620.64610274</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://feminismsinschool.wordpress.com/2014/07/18/girls-and-boys-speak-out-conference/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Researching Girls and Sexuality: Affect, the digital and the body</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F5B5E1AD-DF66-46D1-8D93-F5785833F302</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Girls, sexting and gender politics: making material-discursive space for teens girls as sexual agents (Amy Dobson, Monash University, Australia).

Applicants have been involved in contributing to government guidance and policy development on sexualisation, sex education, sexual health and online safety in England (Government Equalities Office, Body Confidence Campaign, Department of Health, Public Health England) and Wales (Welsh Assembly Government). Applicants have also been active in co-production of training materials and pedagogy with practitioners. As a direct result from our collaborations with international keynote, Rasmussen (Australia) in Seminar 3, we have been commissioned to co-ordinate the chapters on pedagogic practice for the young sexual bodies in a new International Handbook of Sexuality Education (Routledge forthcoming).

Research dissemination channels developed for the seminar series played an important role in the dissemination of research findings for all applicants. They were utilised by Hoggart, for example, for abortion and contraceptive research dissemination that had an impact recognised in the 2014 REF entry for the University of Greenwich where it formed an impact case study for UoA3. papers presented in the series by Hoggart and by Newton prompted partnerships that helped facilitate a number of impacts mentioned in the case study. These included: 'the delivery of a public service has changed' where we noted that there has been a change in contraceptive counselling practice in a number of local areas (eg Greenwich, Hillingdon) where women are now given more information about all possible side-effects of the contraceptive implant, and also advised to return to the clinic as soon as they become concerned about side effects, and that therapeutic interventions can be offered to alleviate bleeding-related side-effects. These changes have been recommended at training workshops conducted by Jane Dickson (consultant in sexual health) throughout the country. A second relevant impact in the case study was that 'Professional training has been influenced by the research'. Again this was facilitated by partnerships emerging from the seminar series. Hoggart and Newton have worked closely with partners to incorporate the findings of their long acting contraceptive research into practitioner training and thus maximise the impact of the research in clinical practice.

Papers from the series have been published in the practitioner journals, Journal for Family Planning and Reproductive Healthcare and Contraception. Other papers have been published in the journal Sexualities, and a special issue on queer sexualities in Discourse: Cultural Politics of Education and the forthcoming edited collection, 'Children, Sexuality and The Sexualisation of Culture' (Renold, Ringrose and Egan). Further academic publications are noted in the Publications section for this award.

Jessica Ringrose and Emma Renolds (along with Alison Phipps and Carolyn Jackson) have had a special issue approved for Journal of Gender Studies. This is a direct outcome of the collaboration between the one day event (led by Jessica Ringrose), 'Researching Girls' Sexualities: Materiality, Affect and the Digital'; which the seminar series partially supported. The special issue for the journal is: 'Rape culture, Laddism and Everyday Sexism: New Mediations of Gender and Sexual Violence'. 

We have at least four on-going academic/practitioner partnerships (specified in the collaborations and partnerships) that were formed as a result of the series. We anticipate further research and development activities, and societal and cultural impact to arise from the activities of these partnerships. 

Finally, networks first developed in this seminar series have led to the development of a programme of impact activities being developed by Hoggart, also specified in collaborations in partnerships, which include making four abortion films, and have culminated in an application for an ESRC Impact Acceleration Award for an Abortion Storytelling installation.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>6A12C7D9-F319-4363-8720-642DAB90C3EA</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>546128f70451c7.58613518</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This award is for a seminar series so we do not have research findings per se.
