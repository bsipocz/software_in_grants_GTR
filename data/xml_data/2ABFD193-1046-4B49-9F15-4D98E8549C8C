By watching our child?s facial expression, we know exactly which toy she will go for. When seeing someone frown at an open window, we are not surprised when she gets up and closes it. Conversely, a breakdown of these predictions might be one reason why social interactions are so confusing to those with autism.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project tests, using behavioral and psychophysical measures, whether there is a sophisticated mechanism in our brains that ?knows? which cues signal the intentions of others and uses this knowledge to predict these people?s actions (eg, looking at something signals interest, a smile signals the tendency to approach).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The first aim is to demonstrate that predictions of other?s behavior are indeed generated when watching others. We will test whether the perception of different social cues is automatically converted into predictions of their future actions.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A second aim is to find out how these predictions come about, and specifically whether these predictions rely on our own action knowledge. A third and final aim is to establish whether such predictions are crucial for social interactions, and whether their breakdown is related to the social difficulties in individuals with autism spectrum disorder. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The present work bridges research in neuroscience, visual perception, social psychology, attention, emotion and the embodied representation of action, and integrates it under the banner of social predictive processes. Its results should have far reaching implications for researchers in each of these fields. It will resolve how understanding others' action goals can affect ones own planning processes, a question for which almost no empirical evidence is available so far, but which is directly linked to main research thrusts in social and clinical psychology, such as Theory of Mind and intention reading. It will make paradigms developed in the field of embodiment and action control usable to address questions from social psychology. The results will be disseminated in national and major international conferences and in high-impact international journals in experimental, social and clinical psychology. At least eight high-ranking publications are expected.

The work will contribute to the public's understanding of science. It will reveal the automatic mechanisms that translate our knowledge about other people into predictions of their behavior. The presence of such mechanisms challenges views of rational, consciously controlled accounts of social interactions by highlighting mechanisms that act as 'auto-pilots' of social behavior and which support (and sometimes undermine) our interactions with others, without us being aware of their presence. Elucidating these mechanisms may have long-term implications for clinical disorders, such as autism and schizophrenia. Even though it is clear that sufferers have deficits in the social domain, it has been hard to pinpoint the nature of the impairments. Identifying the mechanisms guiding social interactions in healthy individuals may therefore provide a yardstick to measure what, specifically, is impaired in these disorders, and may help to develop training programs that improve functioning in social situations. By highlighting what happens if these processes are disrupted in autism, the present work may lead to a better understanding of this disorder, allowing family members and caregivers to interact with affected individuals in a more productive manner.

The comprehensive test of cues used in predicting others' behavior is of relevance for emerging technologies, particularly the burgeoning field of human computer interactions. It may help to develop devices that are sensitive to others' goals and emotions, so that human-machine interactions become more 'in tune' and natural, which is a key factor in driving the adoption of such systems. Devices that 'understand' the cues that signal others' intentions have strong applications for behavior profiling and surveillance. They allow potentially harmful acts to be detected before completion, support computer-based pre-screenings of the data masses accumulated by surveillance systems, and may play a direct role in alerting caregivers to problems with patients living independently (e.g., those suffering from dementia). Knowledge about the cues that humans use to read others' intentions is also relevant for 3d virtual environments that increasingly permeate our online lives, and which depend on the naturalness of avatars for an immersive experience. However, the actions of such avatars are still represented in a very naive fashion and often appear puppet-like to observers. We believe that utilizing the subtle cues that signal the goal of another's action will make the communication of intentionality more effective and may thereby have a direct effect on the immersiveness of such systems and thereby on their economic value.

Finally, impact will be realized through students. The proposed work will directly support the careers and future career choice of the named RA and of project students, Masters students, apprentices and placement students working in the lab and enthuse them for work in research and psychology.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-03-25</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>270569</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of York</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Psychology</gtr:department><gtr:description>Tactile prediction processes in social interactions (with Prof. Steven Tipper, University of York)</gtr:description><gtr:id>05139119-A0A4-4B5F-A5B8-0BC803941418</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Bach, P.

This research program tested how social predictions come about, which cues they rely on, and whether they differ in people with autism spectrum conditions (ASC).
 The main hypothesis (Objective 1), derived from recent predictive coding models of (social) perception (8), was that any idea about others' goals would be immediately translated into mental images of what they would do as a consequence. We indeed revealed such a perceptual format of predictions, which enriches actual sensory input, leading to changes in how other's behaviour is perceived. We showed, for example, that participants reported that a hand moved further towards an object than it really did, if they thought the actor wanted to reach for the object, and further away when anticipating withdrawals (1). Other studies generalised these effects (Objective 2), showing that they are elicited by both an actor's own statements (&amp;quot;I'll take it!&amp;quot;) and instructions by the observer (1,2), objects in the environment (9), prior action history (10) as well as by emotional expressions (e.g. disgust vs. smiles), obstacles in the way of an action, and hand shapes that match a potential goal object (forthcoming publications). 
 The prior literature assumes that perceptual predictions emerge from the observer's own motor system, allowing them to plan actions for the other person (Objective 3). We should then find cross-over effects: the observer's own action goals should induce similar perceptual distortions as inferred goals of others. However, despite several attempts, no such effects were found (1). Nevertheless, we did demonstrate that, in the tactile domain, prediction effects were larger when actions were viewed from a 1st person than a 3rd person perspective (3), suggesting at the very least common mechanisms for predicting own and others' action. Moreover, we confirmed that predicted actions affect own motor output, showing gaze following for predicted gaze of others (4,7), and that automatic imitation is larger for actions that are expected because they produce positive outcomes (forthcoming). Together, these findings suggest a revision of prior theorizing: that predictions first occur perceptually, and that motoric activation follows as a second step, supporting efficient coordination of behaviour (4,5,6,9).
 Finally (Objective 4), we tested whether social predictions are made differently in those with an ASC. Surprisingly, we found that goal-based predictions are, if anything, stronger in ASC than neurotypicals (forthcoming), suggesting an over-reliance on high-level conceptual knowledge at the expense of actual sensory input. These findings may explain why those with ASC tend to avoid social situations, which cannot be made predictable by prior information.
 Together, our findings suggest that people constantly predict others' behaviour. The resulting mental images can then help perception (e.g. if actions are only half seen) and action (either competitive or cooperative), but also learning, when the person's actual behaviour either confirms or challenges our preconceptions about them. They therefore provide novel insights into the mechanisms underpinning social interaction, and how this differs in ASCs.

They are part of the current &amp;quot;predictive coding&amp;quot; revolution in cognitive neuroscience, and provide new avenues for understanding social processes in neurotypical and autistic populations. Frameworks such as ours might explain why people are able to so effortlessly interact with each other, and why our knowledge about other people is so fluently updated by new information. Several results have already been published in high impact peer reviewed articles, both theoretical and empirical, and further publications are forthcoming. One of the theoretical articles emerging from the grant (5) has already spawned two peer reviewed commentaries by important researchers in the field. 
 Our findings are of particular interest for those with an autism spectrum condition and their carers, and we have already started to present them at some of their community events. Further impacts are expected in other, more applied, fields, such as sports psychology, where predicting others' behaviour is crucial (&amp;quot;skate where the puck is going&amp;quot;), and computer vision, aiding the development of biologically inspired algorithms for behaviour prediction, with the goal of creating robots that are able to interact with humans as fluently as other humans do.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>DF629585-F6EA-42CE-88AE-DF35020C7DE2</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e1544cd4d510.91963074</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://actionprediction.com/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>We developed a second novel technique that makes the classic representational momentum-like paradigm usable to test predictive coding in social perception, a current research focus in social neuroscience. Participants are asked to observe actions. At some point, the body part carrying out the action (e.g. the hand) disappears, and participants have to judge where they have last seen it, by pointing on a touch screen. This method is a significant advance to the other method described here. It is highly usable even by participants that struggle with the relative difficult first paradigm (such as children, participants with an autism spectrum disorder). 

As before, the results reveal a perceptual distortion: participants report the hand to have travelled further than it actually has, in line with the idea that perception itself is not a veridical representation of reality, but includes a prediction of what will happen in the future. Importantly, we were able to show that this prediction is affected by the participants' knowledge of the environmental constraints.. For example, actions are distorted away from an obstacle if it blocks the way, or towards a straighter path towards a goal if there is no obstacle.. This paradigm can therefore reveal (a) not only that predictive processes do take place in social perception, but (b) that these processes are not only stimulus-driven by directly influenced by high level information about the other person's goals, and (c) with reference to the current environmental constraints.</gtr:description><gtr:id>9704EDAC-F9CF-46A9-B746-4173BD40F8E9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This procedure is not published yet, but we have demonstrated our novel procedure in talks and posters at conferences, and at invited talks at other universities.
