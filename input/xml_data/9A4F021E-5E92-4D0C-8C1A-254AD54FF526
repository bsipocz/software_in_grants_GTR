How do parasites that cause infectious diseases evolve to overcome host defences? These are the key questions that drive my research, which seeks to understand the continual evolutionary battle between hosts and parasites. Studying how host and parasites &amp;quot;co-evolve&amp;quot; not only has important implications for controlling infectious diseases, but also for answering fundamental questions about the natural world.

All living organisms suffer from infectious diseases caused by parasites, many of which have a serious impact on host health and can be fatal. As such, hosts have evolved a variety of ways of coping with parasitism, from complex and expensive immune systems that recognise and eliminate microscopic pathogens, to grooming behaviour that removes external parasites. Likewise, parasites have evolved fascinating ways of avoiding or overcoming host defences (e.g. by secreting proteins that suppress immune responses), and even manipulating host behaviour to maximise transmission.

Hosts and parasites exist in diverse multi-species communities, which have the potential to impact their evolution through increased competition for resources or changes in cost-benefit trade-offs associated with investing in defence and counter-defence traits. For example, predation may increase pressure on parasites by reducing host availability (resource competition) and may prevent a costly resistance mechanism from evolving if disease becomes rare (trade-offs). However, we currently know very little about how host-parasite coevolution is affected by the wider ecological community (e.g. other hosts and parasites, predators, prey, etc).

The aim of this research programme is to understand the impact of species in the wider ecological community on the evolution of hosts and parasites. To achieve this, I will use mathematical models and computer simulations to reveal the underlying processes and mechanisms that affect how hosts and parasites co-evolve in the presence of other species. I will also collaborate with empiricists to test the new theory and use experimental observations to feed back and further develop the theory.

I will first investigate how the structure of the ecological community affects co-evolutionary dynamics by analysing different networks of interactions. I will then use the knowledge that I have gained about the impact of the wider ecological community to examine the co-evolution of multiple host and parasite traits. This will allow me to answer questions such as: are parasites that infect multiple hosts more likely to be deadly? And when should hosts prioritise adaptive defences over innate defences? Finally, I will work with experimentalists to test and improve the theory by coevolving bacteria and viruses.

My research will provide key insights into fundamental biological phenomena, such as how biodiversity is generated and maintained and the role that parasites play in the evolution of host mating behaviour. Although my work is theoretical, it has important implications for public health. For example, viruses can be used to treat antibiotic resistant infections (phage therapy), but it is crucial to understand how the presence of other microbial species affects bacterial evolution to maximise treatment efficacy. There are consequences for industry and conservation, as well, especially for predicting how human interventions or environmental changes affect the stability of natural ecosystems or managed populations.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research is in basic science and as such will primarily benefit the academic community. By providing fundamental insights into the underlying mechanisms that shape host-parasite coevolution in complex communities, I will lay the foundations for new theoretical and empirical work across disciplines. However, three potential additional beneficiaries are: (1) the public health community; (2) the agri-food industry; and (3) the general public.

Academic community:

This interdisciplinary research programme will be of broad interest to the academic community, especially epidemiologists, ecologists, evolutionary biologists and applied mathematicians. The proposed research will identify key features of multi-species interactions that shape selection for traits such as resistance, infectivity and virulence. This will not only improve our general understanding of how coevolution unfolds in natural communities with implications for core evolutionary principles such as sexual selection, but also our ability to develop more realistic models of infectious diseases, especially zoonotic pathogens. Other researchers will immediately benefit from my work by applying my general theory to understand specific host-parasite systems and by using my simulation and numerical analysis algorithms, which I will publish freely online.

Public health:

My research will help to develop better public health interventions over the long-term by (1) identifying how ecosystem changes affect whether infectious diseases become more virulent or switch to new hosts; and (2) improving the efficacy of phage therapy through a better understanding of multi-species interactions in microbial communities. Phage therapy is likely to become an increasingly important public health intervention due to the spread of antimicrobial resistance. My experimental collaborators have working relationships with phage therapy laboratories in Europe (Prof. Buckling, Exeter) and UK based companies (e.g. Novolytics, Dr Koskella, UC Berkeley), which will help to realise applications of my research to phage therapy. By engaging with industry and regulatory bodies (through Phages for Human Applications Group Europe, P.H.A.G.E.), my research will help to apply evolutionary theory to the design of better treatment regimes that minimise the likelihood that resistance will evolve.

Agri-food industry:

The proposed research will potentially benefit the agri-food industry over the long-term by (1) identifying how best to manage infectious diseases in economically important crops; and (2) improving our understanding of pollinator diseases. In particular, my research will provide insights into the tripartite interaction between honeybees, Varroa mites and Deformed Wing Virus (DWV) and will provide predictions for how best to minimise the evolution of virulence in this system. This work will ultimately benefit the beekeeping industry by lowering colony losses and reducing the need for miticides and other treatments. I will disseminate my research through talks at stakeholder events (e.g. the British Beekeepers Association, BBKA) and by working with other researchers that have long-standing relationships with the beekeeping industry (Prof. de Roode, Dr Brosi, Emory; Prof. Delaplane, UGA).

General public:

This research is likely to resonate with large sections of the general public, as we all have first-hand experience of infectious diseases. It is therefore relatively straightforward to put my research into an understandable and relatable context that can be conveyed through social and conventional media. The proposed citizen science project and other public engagement activities (see Pathways to Impact) will deliver immediate impact in the form of an improved understanding of science among members of the public (including schoolchildren). These outreach activities may also deliver long-term impact by inspiring schoolchildren to become the next generation of scientists.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>446374</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>EBC941AA-F761-42A6-ACA8-E3C1449833DF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Host-parasite fluctuating selection in the absence of specificity.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Proceedings.
