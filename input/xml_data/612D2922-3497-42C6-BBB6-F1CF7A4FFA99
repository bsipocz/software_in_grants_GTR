The project will explore the links between risk and time preferences and behaviour, with a focus on health and wellbeing. A sub-sample of the respondents within the IP will take part into two experimental sessions, taking place at an interval of 12 months, where risk and time preferences will be measured using incentive-compatible tests. Combined survey and experimental data will be used to empirically address three specific research questions related to the &amp;quot;validity&amp;quot; of experimental measures, namely: i) the cross-validation of survey and experimentally-derived measures; ii) the links between risk and time preferences and health-related behaviour; and iii) the stability over time of risk and time preferences and their response to life changes. 
The project aims at benefiting a wide community of researchers - from economics to psychology, from social policy to health and behavioural sciences - in three distinct ways.
First, the project will elicit, for the first time, experimental measures for risk and time preferences for a representative sample of the UK population, and it will link them over time with current survey responses, which themselves are being linked with administrative data. USoc will become the first survey to contain a sub-sample of current panel members whose survey responses will be linked to, and broadly cross-validated by, incentive-compatible tests, which will be available to develop further applications and linkages. 
This fits the ESRC priority themes in the call, encouraging research &amp;quot;involving secondary analysis of existing datasets and the application of innovative research methods&amp;quot;, and will further enhance the leadership of USoc as a unique source of high impact data for academic and policy research. It will also advance the attempts to combine experimental and survey data (e.g. in the Netherlands, using Tilburg's CentERpanel), and to conduct field experiments with samples of the general population (e.g. in Germany and UK, replicating questions in the SOEP and BHPS; in Denmark).
Second, the project will bridge the gap between the lab and the field, ultimately pushing forward the frontiers of experimental methods in behavioural and social sciences, and exploring the synergies and cross-fertilisation between different research methods and inter-disciplinary areas, including experimental analysis, health research, econometric analysis of survey and experimental data, social policy, behavioural sciences.
Third, the focus on health and wellbeing will further enhance the impact of the research, allowing to better relate risk and time preferences and health behaviours, and to provide valuable insights to inform the design of policies to bring about changes in behaviour and wellbeing. 
To achieve the highest impact, several dissemination strategies will be pursued, including: i) Involving world-leading experts within the advisory group; ii) Targeting high-impact peer-reviewed journals, e.g. the American Economic Review, Lancet, and Science; iii) Circulating results in working papers and policy briefings making them immediately available before publication; iv) Organising dissemination events: LSE and ISER have excellent research infrastructures for knowledge exchange and strong links with international academic and policy-making institutions; v) Presenting results at international conferences, e.g. the Royal Economic Society, and the American Economic Association; vi) Building a website for posting events, working papers, and uploading slides, videos and podcasts of presentations. vii) Engaging actively with the media, newsletters and websites (e.g. VoxEU) through regular media briefings with the help of knowledge translators.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-12-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>174671</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Yes. The findings of the project have already been used in four directions. 

First, the inherently interdisciplinary nature of the project has motivated the launch of a cross-disciplinary cross-university platform where experimental and behavioural researchers can meet and interact in London. The project, in fact, has directly fed into the foundation of the London Behavioural and Experimental Group (LBEG), coordinated by Matteo M Galizzi, which brings together, for the first time ever, experimental and behavioural scientists from all the disciplines (economics, psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, business), and from all the universities in London: LSE, UCL, LBS, Imperial Business School, King's College, Birkbeck, Queen Mary, City, SOAS, Royal Holloway, Middlesex, Westminster. The LBEG has set up a dedicated website: www.behavioural-experimental.london, which has greatly enhanced the visibility of the London behavioural research community and the profile of each LBEG member. In the last two years, the LBEG has animated several initiatives including: a series of very popular LBEG Workshops with world-leading behavioural scientists of the calibre of Colin Camerer (Caltech), Gary Charness (UCSB), John List (Chicago), George Loewenstein (Carnegie Mellon), Graham Loomes (Warwick), Matthias Sutter (Cologne), Peter Wakker (Rotterdam), among others; two London PhD Experimental Worskhops; a ground-breaking and highly successful London Experimental Week in December 2015 (LEWeek: http://leweek.co.uk/) involving a series of knowledge exchange and dissemination events taking place in the same week across all the London universities with leading speakers from the policy, business, and academic worlds, such as Orazio Attanasio (UCL), Daniel Berry (NHS England), Tim Chadborn (Public Health England), Stefan Dercon (Oxford, DFID), Benedikt Herrmann (Nottingham, European Commission), Aniol Llorente-Saguer (QMUL), Alison Mclean (Swiss Re), Rosemarie Nagel (Universitat Pompeu Fabra), Giovanni Ponti (Alicante, LUISS), Eyal Winter (Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Leicester); and two PhD training workshops at the LSE Behavioural Research Lab; two popular Jiscmail mailing lists regularly reaching thousands of researchers and practitioners interested in behavioural experiments (behaviour-and-experiments@jiscmail.ac.uk) and behavioural public policy (bpp@jiscmail.ac.uk). The LBEG has also established connections with other existing networks in the UK (e.g. Network for Integrated Behavioural Science, NIBS; Behavioural and Experimental Northeast Cluster, BENC) and internationally (e.g. Science of Philanthropy Initiative, SPI-Hub; Behavioural Experiments in Health Network, BEH-Net). The foundation of the LBEG is thus a long-standing legacy of the project that will foster and immensely facilitate any future dissemination and knowledge exchange strategies among the behavioural and experimental scientists in the London area, and the practitioners and decision-makers in the business, policy, and no-profit sectors. 

Second, the methodologically innovative design of the project has attracted attention from the research teams and organizations that run and manage some leading longitudinal panels and epidemiological cohorts in Europe, such as the TwinsUK Registry, the UK BioBank, and the Millennium Cohort Study in the UK, the KELA National Drugs Prescriptions Register in Finland, and the Constances Panel in France. Matteo M Galizzi has been invited into a high-level policy workshop at Paris in September 2015 to illustrate the case for data linking. He has also been awarded HEIF5 funding to organise a series of knowledge exchange and impact activities at the LSE, culminating in a high-level workshop on the frontiers of 'smart big data' and 'behavioural data linking', involving key decision-makers in leading business, policy, and research institutions such as the Financial Conduct Authority, Google, Dunnhumby, Ogilvy and Mathers, Prolific Academic, Pandora, NESTA, ESRC, Science Europe, Wellcome Trust, Health Foundation, among others.

Third, the methodologically innovative design of the project has also attracted the interest of organisations such as Science Europe, the 'umbrella' organization that represents all funders and research councils in Europe. Science Europe has in fact invited Matteo M Galizzi to a workshop in Bruxelles in May 2015 to present the design of and the main findings of the project, and has subsequently invited him to contribute to draft a new European policy brief for making the case of integrated research infrastructures for the behavioural sciences, bringing closer together lab, field, and online experiments.

Fourth, the preliminary findings of this project have attracted the interest of a working committee at the Department of Health and the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) that has invited Matteo M Galizzi to join the committee as 'expert' in a meeting in July 2015. The meeting aimed to discuss the introduction of new time discounting models to be used in the current cost-effectiveness analyses practices in the UK healthcare sector. The committee, in fact, has reckoned that the current practice of using a constant discounting model may no longer be appropriate or accurate, given the mounting experimental evidence cumulating against the assumption that time discounting is constant. For the same reasons, Matteo M Galizzi has also been invited to be member of the Behavioural Science International Advisory Board of Sanofi.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>5B08A816-238D-49DE-B255-9A25EE3CB461</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56dad09dea16e6.19789227</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Education,Healthcare,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology,Retail</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Key findings

ESRC Future Research Leader Project
Linking Experimental and Survey Data: Behavioural Experiments in Health and Wellbeing 
(ES/K001965/1, PI: MM Galizzi)

Dr Matteo M Galizzi
London School of Economics, m.m.galizzi@lse.ac.uk 

There are three key findings of my ESRC FRL project. Each finding has been incorporated in (at least) one research paper that has been submitted to a leading peer-reviewed scientific journal. Each key finding is originally contributing to the existing literature and evidence both substantially and methodologically.
 
The first key finding and paper is about linking for the first time behavioural economics experiments with longitudinal survey data for a large representative sample of the UK population (Paper 1: Linking experimental and survey data for a UK representative panel: structural estimation of risk and time preferences). The paper documents for the first time with a representative sample of respondents within the Understanding Society panel (also known as UKHLS) some of the 'classic' behavioural economics anomalies that have previously been showed exclusively for small and specific samples of student subjects. This study is of interest to research organizations that run longitudinal surveys with representative samples of the population. It illustrates the case that integrating behavioural economics measures in ongoing surveys is feasible, and that promising insights can be gathered by systematically linking experimental, survey, administrative, and biomarkers data, and by running behavioural economics studies outside traditionally student-centred lab experiments. It has attracted attention from the research teams that are managing some other leading longitudinal surveys and epidemiological cohorts in the UK, France, and Finland. I have been invited into a policy workshop at Paris School of Economics in September 2015 to illustrate this case for data linking. I got involved in a series of knowledge exchange and impact activities between 2015 and 2016, culminating in the successful London Experimental Week (LEWeek) and in some high-level workshops at the LSE on the frontiers of 'behavioural data linking'.

The second key finding and paper is a randomized controlled experiment comparing the responses to behavioural economics tests across a traditional face-to-face computer assisted professional interview (CAPI) and a web-based interview mode (Paper 2: Estimates of risk and time preferences do not differ across web and face-to-face incentivised experiments: evidence from a UK representative survey). The experiment finds no statistically significant differences in the elicited responses across the two interview modes when the analysis adjusts for selection in the mode and controls for different sample composition. Respondents make significantly less 'errors' when responding to the web mode, compared to the CAPI mode. The study is of interest under two perspectives. First, there is currently a trend to 'migrate' large representative surveys to the web, for budget-saving reasons and to minimize attrition and non-response. Second, behavioural scientists are increasingly conducting experiments using online samples. The study shows that nothing in the 'structurally estimated' behavioural parameters would be lost by moving online, and if anything, web responses could benefit from higher precision in the estimates of behavioural parameters. The study has attracted the interest of organisations such as Science Europe, the 'umbrella' organization that represents all funders and research councils in Europe, that has invited me to a workshop in Bruxelles in May 2015 to present the project and contribute for making the case of integrating research infrastructures for the behavioural sciences, bringing closer together lab, field, and online experiments.

The third key finding consists of two 'parallel' papers. The first paper looks systematically at the 'cross-validity', 'temporal stability' and 'external validity' of three different measures of risk preferences, by focusing on risky health behaviours (Paper 3: Stability, cross-validity, and external validity of risk preferences measures: experimental evidence from a UK representative survey). To date, this is the most comprehensive and systematic exercise of this type to be conducted with a representative sample of the population. It has raised attention among behavioural and experimental economists in the UK and abroad and in networks such as the London Behavioural and Experimental Group (LBEG), and the Behavioural Experiments in Health Network, BEH-Net). A second paper has replicated the same research design looking at the time preferences measures, in particular by focusing on happiness and subjective wellbeing (Paper 4: Subjective wellbeing and 'inconsistent' time preferences: experimental evidence from a UK representative sample). The preliminary findings of have attracted the interest of a working committee at the Department of Health and the NICE that has invited me to join as 'expert' in a meeting in July 2015. Reckoning the mounting evidence against the assumption that time discounting is constant, the meeting aimed to discuss the introduction of new time discounting models to be used in the current cost-effectiveness analyses practices in the UK healthcare sector.

Paper 2 has attracted the interest of organisations such as Science Europe, the 'umbrella' organization that represents all funders and research councils in Europe.

The committee, in fact, has reckoned that the current practice of using a constant discounting model may no longer be appropriate or accurate, given the mounting experimental evidence cumulating against the assumption that time discounting is indeed constant.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>62B399A7-E9DB-492F-A703-E76B7C5C8953</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56ae84382a1277.03219280</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8EA1754F-23BC-44A0-B4A5-6C70587B3CB3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Like ripples on a pond: Behavioral spillovers and their implications for research and policy</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Economic Psychology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/afa48f3dbac24b1a9b33539b209f215b"><gtr:id>afa48f3dbac24b1a9b33539b209f215b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dolan P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56c656f4d089e4.76106302</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>07CA15F7-8569-4515-9E64-5B049CDC58F5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Because I'm worth it: a lab-field experiment on the spillover effects of incentives in health</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/afa48f3dbac24b1a9b33539b209f215b"><gtr:id>afa48f3dbac24b1a9b33539b209f215b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dolan P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56dae2b80bddb1.91601029</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4CFA30A7-F3C7-418C-B152-2066EB86F563</gtr:id><gtr:title>Handbook of Policy Formulation</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/bd1393cb9ef164c04eee1264dd96623a"><gtr:id>bd1393cb9ef164c04eee1264dd96623a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Galizzi M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56df137e4ae708.25637468</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8DA370DB-B8CD-496A-AA7D-25215362CC8A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Digit ratio and risk taking: evidence from a large, multi-ethnic sample</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/894b3d96bcad592667a382c71d09991a"><gtr:id>894b3d96bcad592667a382c71d09991a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Galizzi MM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56dae17a9f8649.18867299</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>CCAF3459-30F3-4A18-9E47-FB1E465753FD</gtr:id><gtr:title>Estimates of risk and time preferences do not differ across web and face-to-face incentivised experiments: evidence from a UK representative survey</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/894b3d96bcad592667a382c71d09991a"><gtr:id>894b3d96bcad592667a382c71d09991a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Galizzi MM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>56df1092522964.96930785</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>FC64AAA1-514C-4F3F-8037-1ACE71070049</gtr:id><gtr:title>Are you what you eat?
