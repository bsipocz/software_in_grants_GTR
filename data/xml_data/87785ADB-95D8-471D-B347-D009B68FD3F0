It is constantly invoked in political discourse, not only in discussions of 'ethnic cleansing' and genocide but in a huge range of issues (most recently, for example, in debates about freedom of speech and religious hate). It is the subject of museums, memorial days and other forms of historical and memorial activity. It also pervades other forms of cultural production, from a moment in a children's film where the villain tells his sidekick to use the 'Nuremburg defence'-- &amp;quot;tell them you were only following orders&amp;quot; I to Salman Rushdie's 2005 novel Shalimar The Clown which juxtaposes the Holocaust with the 'War on Terror'. 
The Holocaust has penetrated deeper into our contemporary culture than can easily be traced and is a 'touch stone' for modern self-understanding. However, as the more authorised historical productions focus, refine, remember and explain the events, other significant forms of cultural production offer new, sometimes controversial and uncomfortable understandings of it. These insights are rarely bought to bear I and are often simply ignored --in the fields that study the Holocaust. Some historians have discussed how traditionally historical forms of cultural production, such as the work of historians themselves, museums and acts of pubic memory, represent the Holocaust. Scholars have also discussed how works in the 'Holocaust canon' I such as 'Schindler's list' (1993) and the writing of Elie Wiesel-- represent the Holocaust. However, there is very little on recent or 'uneconomical' texts which deal with the Holocaust but often stem from different cultural fields, geographical areas or discourses. Analysing these powerful and more marginal texts and discourses will be of interest to researchers working in literary and cultural studies, history and Holocaust studies, as well as those with a broader interest in the Holocaust and its implications. Because both discussions about the Holocaust and the scope of the book are international, I expect this project to have an international impact.

Aims and Objectives The aim of this project will be to produce an 80,000 word monograph which analyses and accounts for a series of ideas and debates about the meaning and significance of the Holocaust that come from significant sources outside the more usually authorised fields. Through this dissemination, the project will also aim to bring into the mainstream of scholarly and public debate a series of disparate and marginalised engagements with the Holocaust and its legacy and offer a significant contrast to the important work undertaken by historians in this field. Potential Applications and Benefits The potential applications and benefits of this research are set within the international frameworks of contemporary intellectual and cultural debates. The research will illuminate and clarify areas in which, often, a great deal of heat is generated (about 'misinterpretations of the Holocaust', for example), but not much light is shed. It will also serve to bring into international discussion a series of divergent views (from Eastern Europe, from the less developed world, from popular culture and popular science) that are often ignored in current debates about the Holocaust, which have become particularly centred in the USA's cultural sphere.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-04-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-01-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>19692</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/E504450/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>470B20F0-5FD1-4AA6-8809-5E2780CBDB18</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Comparative Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8C451D81-4626-46D5-BE5B-7B684CED97EF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural Studies &amp; Pop Culture</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9DFBE9F1-538E-4C96-B606-5163472E6960</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Literary &amp; Cultural Theory</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
