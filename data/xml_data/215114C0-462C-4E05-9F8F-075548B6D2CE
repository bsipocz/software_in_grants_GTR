SINATRA)</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>NE/K008765/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Project SINATRA responds to the NERC call for research on flooding from intense rainfall (FFIR) with a programme of focused research designed to advance general scientific understanding of the processes determining the probability, incidence, and impacts of FFIR.

Such extreme rainfall events may only last for a few hours at most, but can generate terrifying and destructive floods. Their impact can be affected by a wide range factors (or processes) such as the location and intensity of the rainfall, the shape and steepness of the catchment it falls on, how much sediment is moved by the water and the vulnerability of the communities in the flood's path. Furthermore, FFIR are by their nature rapid, making it very difficult for researchers to 'capture' measurements during events. The complexity, speed and lack of field measurements on FFIR make it difficult to create computer models to predict flooding and often we are uncertain as to their accuracy. 

To address these issues, NERC launched the FFIR research programme. It aims to reduce the risks from surface water and flash floods by improving our identification and prediction of the meteorological (weather), hydrological (flooding) and hydro-morphological (sediment and debris moved by floods) processes that lead to FFIR. A major requirement of the programme is identifying how particular catchments may be vulnerable to FFIR, due to factors such as catchment area, shape, geology and soil type as well as land-use. Additionally, the catchments most susceptible to FFIR are often small and ungauged.

Project SINATRA will address these issues in three stages: Firstly increasing our understanding of what factors cause FFIR and gathering new, high resolution measurements of FFIR; Secondly using this new understanding and data to improve models of FFIR so we can predict where they may happen - nationwide and; Third to use these new findings and predictions to provide the Environment Agency and over professionals with information and software they can use to manage FFIR, reducing their damage and impact to communities. 
In more detail, we will:
1. Enhance scientific understanding of the processes controlling FFIR, by-
(a) assembling an archive of past FFIR events in Britain and their impacts, as a prerequisite for improving our ability to predict future occurrences of FFIR.
(b) making real time observations of flooding during flood events as well as post-event surveys and historical event reconstruction, using fieldwork and crowd-sourcing methods.
(c) characterising the physical drivers for UK summer flooding events by identifying the large-scale atmospheric conditions associated with FFIR events, and linking them to catchment type.
2. Develop improved computer modelling capability to predict FFIR processes, by-
(a) employing an integrated catchment/urban scale modelling approach to FFIR at high spatial and temporal scales, modelling rapid catchment response to flash floods and their impacts in urban areas.
(b) scaling up to larger catchments by improving the representation of fast riverine and surface water flooding and hydromorphic change (including debris flow) in regional scale models of FFIR.
(c) improving the representation of FFIR in the JULES land surface model by integrating river routing and fast runoff processes, and performing assimilation of soil moisture and river discharge into the model run.
3. Translate these improvements in science into practical tools to inform the public more effectively, by-
(a) developing tools to enable prediction of future FFIR impacts to support the Flood Forecasting Centre in issuing new 'impacts-based' warnings about their occurrence.
(b) developing a FFIR analysis tool to assess risks associated with rare events in complex situations involving incomplete knowledge, analogous to those developed for safety assessment in radioactive waste management.

In so doing SINATRA will achieve NERC's science goals for the FFIR programme.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>SINATRA will deliver a number of important benefits for our immediate UK project partners and for the wider public, who will ultimately be served by more effective flood forecasting and management systems, both in the UK and beyond. 

SINATRA will help the Met Office, the Environment Agency, and their joint Flood Forecasting Centre (FFC) meet the demands of the Pitt Review (2008: vii) for a &amp;quot;a step change in the quality of flood warnings&amp;quot; and in their capacity to forecast groundwater, surface water and other kinds of flooding from intense rainfall (FFIR).

Beyond the UK, SINATRA's findings will also be of benefit to forecasters dealing with similar challenges elsewhere, including the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI) and Dutch Rijkswaterstaat, the executive water management organisation of the Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment, who have all provided letters of support outlining their interest in the project.

By improving the basis for assessing impacts, SINATRA will also make important contributions to fulfilling the strategic aims of the Cabinet Office's National Hazards Partnership and to meeting the demands made by the expressed by the Met Office Public Weather Service Customer Group, on behalf of the civil contingencies community, for more proportionate and meaningful warnings 

At the local and regional scale, SINATRA will also improve the evidence-base on catchment susceptibility factors needed by Local Authorities to fulfil their new duties under the 2010 Flood and Water Management Act to be the lead agencies responsible for the management of flood risk from surface runoff, groundwater, and small (so-called &amp;quot;ordinary&amp;quot;) watercourses. The database of FFIR events and impacts, as well as the analysis of extreme value statistics and of catchment susceptibility factors, will also help critical infrastructure providers, the insurance industry and others across the private sector to appreciate their exposure to FFIR.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>297546</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>National Taiwan University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Taiwan</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Bioenvironmental Systems Engineering</gtr:department><gtr:description>2014-16 RS-NSC Development of real-time flash flood mapping and early warning system</gtr:description><gtr:id>C4775862-3EE0-4CE4-B68E-888D9E3B1FF2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>CWS and NTU had intense interactions under the international collaboration project.

Two of them are coastal cities facing sea level rise impact as well. An urban growth model will be developed using the satellite sensor data and the artificial intelligence techniques to detect the changing trends of urban sprawl and to project future urban growth scenarios in these three cities. The parameters derived from the urban growth model will be used in hydraulic modelling to assess the flood impact for the whole city in the 2050s. The state-of-the-art hydraulic models will be adopted to simulate flooding in complex urban environment with high spatial resolution. The multi-disciplinary collaboration will bring the experts from the UK, the US and China together to create an operational framework for analysing flood impact associated with various urban development conditions and climate change scenarios at the mega-city scale.

He will contribute his experience to modelling the flash floods in ultra-urban region. Dr Jian Sun is a lecturer at THU. He has been working on numerical model simulations with the aid of physical experiments of urban flood flows in urban regions. He will contribute to the development of computer models for large scale urban flood predictions.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>In the project, we aim to investigate the future flood impact as the consequence of the combination of urban development and climate change in three mega cities - London, New York and Beijing. Two of them are coastal cities facing sea level rise impact as well. An urban growth model will be developed using the satellite sensor data and the artificial intelligence techniques to detect the changing trends of urban sprawl and to project future urban growth scenarios in these three cities. The parameters derived from the urban growth model will be used in hydraulic modelling to assess the flood impact for the whole city in the 2050s. The state-of-the-art hydraulic models will be adopted to simulate flooding in complex urban environment with high spatial resolution. The multi-disciplinary collaboration will bring the experts from the UK, the US and China together to create an operational framework for analysing flood impact associated with various urban development conditions and climate change scenarios at the mega-city scale. The results can inform urban planners about the potential increase of flood risk such that better urban development strategies can be developed and implemented to avoid unexpected flood impact.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Tsinghua University China</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>China, People's Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Hydraulic Engineering</gtr:department><gtr:description>2015-17 RS-NSFC Hydrodynamic analysis of urban features with physical and numerical experiments</gtr:description><gtr:id>A74AC4F4-1C56-4D95-BA08-903D43BC6F02</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr Di Zhang visited CWS in July 2015 to work with Dr Albert Chen and Dr Guangtao Fu on flood model development.

The laboratory has six flumes and one of them has been particular designed for flood simulations in urban environment. This provides a great chance to observe the flow dynamics influenced by different urban features. The observed data can then be used to calibrate and to validate the new model.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The Centre for Water Systems (CWS) at the University of Exeter has developed a series of computer models (e.g. UIM and CADDIES-2D) to improve the performance of urban flood simulations. The UIM introduces additional parameters in the coarse grid modelling to describe those features that affect the flood movement. To simulate the flooding more efficiently CADDIES-2D adopts simplified rules, which borrow ideas from a computer science field instead of solving hydraulic equations. CADDIES-2D also includes different hardware-based parallelising techniques that further accelerate the calculations. In the project, we aim to combine the strength of the UIM and the CADDIES-2D to develop a new model that can simulate urban flooding at large scale accurately and efficiently. The model will be applied to flood simulations in case study cities to identify the areas that are prone to flooding such that better adaptation measures can be developed to mitigate the flood risk.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Surrey</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering</gtr:department><gtr:description>2016 Meeting Prof Jianping Wu at Tsinghua University</gtr:description><gtr:id>96C18DAE-4E23-4FE6-B56D-6B20CEC08C3B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Developed the idea to transportation management system that combines flood modelling and early warning, autonomous vehicle for emergency management.

The topic was 'Promoting and supporting scientific and technical research that will inform disaster management practice and policy' and it included four sessions:
? Necessary bridging for successful Disaster Risk Reduction and Management
? Current Disaster Risk Reduction policy creation process and required research efforts
? Current Disaster Risk Reduction research efforts in the Asia-Pacific and processes for determining research topics
? Bridging the gap between science and policy together

Dr Chen presented the research findings from the related projects that the CWS has contributed to, including EU FP7 CORFU and PEARL, H2020 RESCCUE and EU-CIRCLE , EPSRC CADDIES, CREW/SWERVE, and FRMRC/FRMRC2, and British Council Global Innovation Initiative, to officials and experts in disaster management from ASEAN countries. 
Dr Chen also shared the work in the ongoing NERC FFIR programme and discussed potential future research to help policy makers. The audience identified that flash flooding as a key area where better science and technology are desperately needed to support decision makings in hazard mitigation. Research outcomes from FFIR programme will benefit ASEAN countries in building the capacity of flood forecasting that consequently will enhance early warning and reduce flood
