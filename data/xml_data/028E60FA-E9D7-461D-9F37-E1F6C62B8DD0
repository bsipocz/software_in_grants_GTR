To make sense of an environment, we need to be able to distinguish sequences, i.e., stimuli that are temporally patterned. Auditory and tactile stimuli can only be understood in terms of their temporal structure - a cue that the brain is particularly good at deciphering and remembering, for example when we learn a new song or a certain rhythm. The ability to generate and decode sequences of electrical activity is ubiquitous throughout the brain. Moreover, sequence learning and the processing of temporal duration are impaired in psychiatric disorders including depression and schizophrenia. Yet despite this centrality of sequence selectivity, remarkably little is known about its substrates in the brain. The chain of events from when a sequential temporal pattern is first reflected in the electrical activity of neurons to when it is classified as an &amp;quot;object,&amp;quot; a meaningful entity, remains unknown. This is a major gap in our functional understanding of the brain. 

The goal of this project is to understand how representations of sequences emerge from the activity of populations of neurons in the cerebral cortex - the part of the brain that combines information from the senses, assigns it a meaning, relates it to earlier experience and decides on a response. To show how electrical activity in neurons relates to sequence recognition, it is necessary to link neuronal responses during presentation of a sequence to a specific behaviour showing that the subject distinguishes the sequence. To this end, we have created a novel behavioural task that is successfully performed by mice as well as by humans. Mice learn to detect arbitrary sequences of stimulation delivered to their whisker - tactile &amp;quot;songs&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;words.&amp;quot; The sequences presented differ only in their temporal patterning, and mice learn to recognise a particular sequence for a reward. This experimental design is designed to allow us to search for general principles of sequence recognition in the brain, and specifically to test whether neurons sensitive to a given sequence reside in sensory areas of the cortex. 

We propose to combine this design with powerful new techniques for examining and manipulating brain activity. We will use methods of electrophysiology and two-photon imaging, already established in our laboratory, to record activity. Recordings will be targeted to groups of neurons in the cerebral cortex by means of state-of-the-art genetic and imaging tools. These experiments will allow us to uncover the neuronal activity related to the controlled sensory behaviour and identify neurons that are selective to a particular sequence. 

Our research will provide new insights into how neuronal circuits process information over time to give rise to sensation and perception. Because the neuronal circuitry in sensory areas of the cerebral cortex is similar in different mammalian species, this new knowledge will be relevant across species and will apply to human sequence learning as well. The outcome will have implications beyond improving our fundamental understanding of information flow through cortical neurons. As sequence processing is often impaired in disorders that perturb the normal establishment of neuronal circuits in the cortex, our approach will help the understanding of the functional effects of those disorders, and provide an assay for testing neurobiological models of brain pathologies.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>How does the brain represent and decipher sequences? Temporal stimulus patterning over hundreds of milliseconds to seconds is a ubiquitous feature of events and scenes and enables perception of rhythm, speech or textures. How a sequential pattern is reflected in spiking activity across populations of neurons, integrated over time, and classified as a meaningful entity in an intact animal is unknown. 

We aim to dissect cortical substrates of sequence selectivity by combining a novel behavioural task for tactile sequence recognition in mice with state-of-the-art tools for targeting neuronal populations and recording activity. The experimental design allows precise control of stimulus and behavioural response: a head-fixed mouse receives a reward on licking a spout whenever it recognises a certain target stimulation sequence. The sequence is distinct from non-target ones only in its specific temporal order and patterning. To determine how sequence representations emerge, we will measure sequence selectivity in neurons at initial and later stages of processing in the somatosensory cortex; test whether neuronal selectivity to sequence identity changes during training; uncover representations of sequence identity in the collective activity of neuronal populations along the somatosensory pathway; and establish the causal participation of specific populations in sequence discrimination by optogenetically perturbing their activity while an animal performs the sequence recognition task. Recordings of neuronal activity will be carried out using two-photon imaging of genetically targeted populations and multichannel extracellular electrophysiology. A central neuroinformatics component will come from the application of novel computational methods to the analysis of neuronal responses. These techniques are established in the Maravall lab at the University of Sussex. The project will provide new insight into the neuronal activity underlying sequence perception.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>This basic neuroscience project is aimed at producing new insight into the fundamental neuronal substrates of sequence selectivity. We expect the new knowledge generated in this way to have several potential avenues for impact.

How will they benefit?

Academic beneficiaries:

During the lifetime of the project, the main form of impact will be within the academic community. Several benefits can be envisaged:
- Because the work relies on adopting and developing cutting-edge experimental and computational techniques, a significant benefit will involve capacity building for students, who may then go on to develop careers in scientific industry as well as in academia. The new capacities will include skills in experimental neurobiology (cutting-edge techniques of neurophysiology and imaging) and in computer coding (code for data mining and analysis). These skills are applicable to careers in clinical brain research and more broadly in biomedicine, and also in the data sciences. The project is also likely to generate new tools for data analysis, which will be shared with the community.
- The project addresses an underexplored yet important computation carried out across the brain, so has the potential to produce findings of substantial significance, applicable to different brain areas and sensory systems.
- Because neuronal circuitry in the cerebral cortex has deep homologies across mammalian species, new knowledge will be relevant across species and apply to human sequence learning as well. 

Beneficiaries of applications of advances stemming from the project:

Over a longer time course (3-6 years), we envisage further potential impacts. These impacts, and the steps we will take to achieve them, are detailed in the Pathways to Impact: 
- Platform for analysis of cortical pathologies. Sequence recognition provides a model for high-level sensory processing in the cerebral cortex. Of direct relevance, sequence processing is impaired in psychiatric disorders that perturb neuronal circuits in the cerebral cortex, so our approach, which is based on a behavioural assay for sequence recognition, could help evaluate the functional effects of neurobiological models used to study brain pathologies. We will engage with potential users in industry and with applied researchers to develop and exploit the potential for this assay.
- Bioinspired computational algorithms for sequence detection. We will engage with engineers from the outset of the project to try to identify possible applications of our work.
- New tools for data mining and analysis, including tools for interpreting neuronal population codes for sensory information. We will share any analysis tools resulting from the project by making them freely available. One potentially important direction comes from findings on population coding that could be used to develop coding and decoding algorithms for the control of Brain-Machine Interfaces. These could be applied to the design of neural prostheses/implants, with significant health and economic impact. We will be alert to any possibilities in this direction, which will be immediately explored in collaboration with neuroengineers. 

General public:

We will make extensive use of public engagement channels to share the implications of our work with the public, as detailed in the Communications Plan and Pathways to Impact.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>487900</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>742A6582-6E7E-4743-A506-E0A867EB92E8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Organization of sensory feature selectivity in the whisker system.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Neuroscience</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2d87065d8f6a876b0737b64d9f9f5919"><gtr:id>2d87065d8f6a876b0737b64d9f9f5919</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bale MR</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0306-4522</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a643af847bb39.70630548</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7866EDB2-71A8-4225-B124-DFC3B7E85351</gtr:id><gtr:title>Interspersed Distribution of Selectivity to Kinematic Stimulus Features in Supragranular Layers of Mouse Barrel Cortex.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/cb3efcf182bc4227e4628667ab6a8ddb"><gtr:id>cb3efcf182bc4227e4628667ab6a8ddb</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Martini FJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1047-3211</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a361c496d0402.89277889</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D6F62796-487A-447F-AEF2-A7F130B747CA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Learning and recognition of tactile temporal sequences by mice and humans.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>eLife</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2d87065d8f6a876b0737b64d9f9f5919"><gtr:id>2d87065d8f6a876b0737b64d9f9f5919</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bale MR</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2050-084X</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fd5da93ce58.95062066</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/P006639/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>041997EB-CFD8-493D-B0F8-DFA35451D0BE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Neurological</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>CF950C9A-DB16-4E23-8AEB-94548777BCA1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>1.1  Normal biological development and functioning</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
