The research builds and extends on previous research on Chinese museums, which provides the framework for a comparative China-Taiwan perspective.\nAs privileged sites for the representation of collective identities and the construction of notions of belonging, museums as few other institutions can capture the transformations affecting cultural identities in contemporary multicultural societies. In Taiwan, such processes are exceptionally complex. The material culture of Taiwanese Aborigines figures prominently not only in the museums of Taiwan, but also in the Shanghai Museum and the National Museum of Palau. Why have Taiwanese Aborigines become so prominent in a variety of museums in Taiwan? How are the meanings of Aborigine material culture appropriated, negotiated and transformed in museums? And what do these modes of representation tell us about the role of museum displays of cultural difference in the making of local, national and regional identities?\nThese questions gain saliency when considering that Taiwan Aborigines and their material culture are at the core of at least 3 simultaneous processes: i) Aborigine's claims to political recognition and self-empowerment; ii) the 'nationalization' of Aborigine identity as a result of Aborigines' incorporation into the master narrative of the Taiwanese nation; iii) the strategic positioning of Taiwan in the Pacific through discourses on the Austronesian origins of Aborigines, also serving Taiwan's claims to cultural independence from mainland China. In such a context, the representation of Aborigine material culture in museums is entangled in the making of indigenous, national and regional identities.\nThe research aims to provide an original and timely contribution to the understanding of the social and political stakes associated with the museum representation of indigenous groups. It will do so by developing a theoretical framework to investigate, through the prism of museums, the relation between indigenous groups and the nation in the under-researched yet unique case study of Taiwan.\nBuilding on the analysis of data collected during fieldwork in Taiwan, the research will:\n- contribute to the understanding of museums' role in post-colonial, multicultural societies by making apparent the agency of museums in negotiations of authority between the State and Aborigines;\n- further the investigation of non-Western museological models by revealing indigenous museum epistemologies;\n- enhance the understanding of the cultural foundations of Taiwanese nationalism;\nResearch findings will be disseminated through: 2 peer-reviewed articles addressing an interdisciplinary academic audience; 1 article addressing museum professionals; 3 seminar presentations. A grant application for future research in Taiwan will be submitted to the AHRC Research Grants-Early Career Researchers.\nThe fellowship will be held at the School of Museum Studies, University of Leicester, where I am currently an Honorary Visiting Fellow. The School has been chosen for 1) research excellence: in 2008, the RAE rated it as having the greatest cluster of world-leading researchers of any discipline in any UK University; 2) relevance of research in my areas of interest: material culture and cultural representation, museums and communities, and museums in East Asia; and 3) broad network of links, in the UK and internationally, with museums and universities. I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to be mentored by Dr. Sandell, who has made key contributions to debates on museums, inequality and social inclusion, and has extensive experience in supervising doctoral students working on Taiwanese museums.\nIn consideration of the above, the School of Museum Studies willprovide the optimal institutional and intellectual support to develop my academic career.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>By revealing the political stakes connected to the museum representation of Taiwanese Aborigines, this research provides museum professionals, policy makers and citizens at large with a timely and relevant tool to better appreciate museums' potential as enhancers of multicultural dialogue and social cohesion. \nThe proposed research is likely to produce impacts in the UK and internationally in 3 interconnected areas: 1) museum practice (by providing comparative models of curatorship); 2) cultural and social relations (by fostering knowledge of East-Asian ethnic groups); 3) the politics of cultural representation (by providing empirical evidence likely to affect the formulation of cultural and ethnic policies in East-Asia and the UK).\n\n1) Impacts on museum professionals\nMy analysis of Taiwanese museums will disclose key aspects of the still largely uncharted domain of museology in East-Asia, thus providing museum professionals in the UK and abroad with specific and relatively little known models of curatorship. This is especially important given the increasing levels of collaboration and exchange between museum professionals in China and Taiwan, and Europe. \nA critical assessment of museum representations of ethnic groups in East-Asia will enhance the awareness of the risks and potentials inherent to specific modalities of cultural representation, among museum professionals in Taiwan, China and the UK. This is likely to play a role in the development of new exhibition formats and the establishment of new relationships with the ethnic communities represented. \nMuseum professionals will be addressed through the article in Museum Practice and the seminar presentation at Leicester ('Perspectives' seminar series for future museum professionals).\n\n2) Impacts on cultural and social relations in and between East-Asia and the UK\nCopyright permitting, research findings will be made available to the general public through the Leicester Research Archive (https://lra.le.ac.uk/), a publicly accessible digital collection of research material from members of the University of Leicester. Research findings will also have indirect effects on public audiences through the impacts on academics and museum professionals, by generating an informed appreciation of East-Asian ethnic groups, thus fostering inter-ethnic dialogue. This is particularly relevant in the UK, increasingly engaged in international relations with China and Taiwan, and increasingly multicultural - East-Asian communities featuring among the most prominent migrant communities in the UK. \n\n3) Impacts on the politics of cultural representation in East Asia and the UK\nArticles and seminars provide relevant, first-hand data on source communities' involvement in their museum representation in Taiwan and China. This may be of interest to:\n- source communities willing to become involved in their museum representation;\n- NGOs focusing on indigenous groups' rights of self-representation;\n- international organizations such as the International Council of Museums (and sub-committees ICOFOM and ASPAC-Asia and Pacific), and UNESCO for the analysis of the challenges to the expression of cultural diversity; \n- policy-makers at local and national level in Europe (my analysis of East-Asian cultural and ethnic policies may positively impact on the development of national cultural policies addressing East-Asian communities in the UK and European countries), and in China and Taiwan (for a critical discussion of the social, cultural and political implications of specific museum representations of ethnic identities). \n\nMid- to long-term impacts of the research\nResearch impacts inscribe in a mid-to-long term perspective.

As a result, the research outcomes 
- contribute to the understanding of museums' role in post-colonial, multicultural societies;
- further the investigation of non-Western museological models by revealing indigenous museum epistemologies;
- enhance the understanding of the cultural foundations of Taiwanese nationalism.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Academically, research findings can be taken forward by colleague working on museums studies, in comparative analysis of the representation of indigenous groups and ethnic minorities for instance. 
Beyond the academia, and specifically among museum professionals, my findings can be taken as a springboard to rethink critically about the implications of museum representations of indigenous and minority groups.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0ACD9619-AD9A-465C-8800-8C0A10E36C97</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54492a68d8ae06.08333734</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>24AFB8B6-B634-4D0B-BD44-A9EB287AF984</gtr:id><gtr:title>The thing about museums</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b32f5e99e8711562f71bccf53464ff50"><gtr:id>b32f5e99e8711562f71bccf53464ff50</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Marzia Varutti</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5449218c9dc370.21070866</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8A692638-699E-45EB-BF28-F828EFE8BD25</gtr:id><gtr:title>Museums in China.
