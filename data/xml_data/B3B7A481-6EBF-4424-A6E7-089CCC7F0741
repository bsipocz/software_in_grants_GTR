We need new approaches and new methods. NERC science is developing and providing such tools, models and expertise. However, getting this knowledge and experience widely disseminated to those who can benefit from it, can be a challenge.

Over the last 3 years, an existing KE fellowship has built a large number of positive, trusted and productive relationships both within academia and across a broad range of end users. The continuation of this fellowship in line with the four key objective areas will strengthen and build partnerships (and broker new ones) in specific areas or particular current interest related to flooding, and water quality management, particularly in uplands and urban areas. The fellowship will ensure that these collaborations continue into the future and are embedded in the ethos of the organisations involved. It takes time to build trust and to demonstrate successes. The interest and commitment from external organisations is gaining pace, as they are now investing in applying NERC science. This is a direct result of the existing fellowship and will continue momentum, providing the Fellow continues to lead and support these collaborations and explain /demonstrate the added value gained.

As well as the valuable meetings, briefings and conferences which bring science and science users together, the Fellowship will demonstrate practical application of science use through involvement in projects which she has instigated (between academia and business). These projects will demonstrate uptake of NERC science e.g. in upland management, and urban planning. Benefits resulting from these projects will be communicated widely to encourage further such collaborations. Routes to undertake effective communication are already in place through the Upland Hydrology Group, the Food Farming and Rural Networks, the Regional Flood and Coastal Committees (who are interested in new ways to manage flood risk in urban and rural areas) to name a few.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-08</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-12-09</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>58264</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Over the last 3 years, an existing KE fellowship has built a large number of positive, trusted and productive relationships both within academia and across a broad range of end users. The continuation of this has provided further impact over four key objective areas.
As well as the valuable meetings, briefings and conferences which bring science and science users together, the Fellowship has demonstrated practical application of science use through involvement in projects instigated (between academia and business). These projects will demonstrate uptake of NERC science e.g. in upland management, and urban planning. Benefits resulting from these projects will be communicated widely to encourage further such collaborations. Routes to undertake effective communication are already in place through the Upland Hydrology Group, the Food Farming and Rural Networks, the Regional Flood and Coastal Committees (for which the fellowship has provided several papers given their interest in new ways to manage flood risk in urban and rural areas) to name a few.
Other successful impacts have been linking local community groups and rivers trusts with academics to inform the catchment based approach (eg Aire Rivers Trust, Garforth Flood Group, Wortley Beck project). The fellowship has also promoted the Aire and Calder instrumented catchment to secure sites for monitors and data capture.
The fellow held a highly successful event on Upland water management with the Upland Hydrology Group and water@leeds supported by the British Hydrological Society supported and NERC where over 140 delegates heard from leading specialists and discussed key topics. A briefing note will be widely circulated to inform all involved with upland management. A popular stand at the National Game Fair was also organised by the fellow to convey the science of our uplands to a wide audience.
Collaborations to share information and develop approaches to upland management have been demonstrated through work with the DEFRA pathfinder project and the National Flood Forum. 
The fellow has also produced a number of case studies for NERC across the science base at Leeds. As part of her involvement in the IAA work the suggestion of an Impact Centre was raised with NERC Chief Exec - this has likely resulted in the recent call for such centres.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>EFD3EF51-87C4-4A28-8A71-DFBD8E86C813</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56cc469a830625.79080185</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Knowledge exchange is an important role in the communication between science and policy needs.
