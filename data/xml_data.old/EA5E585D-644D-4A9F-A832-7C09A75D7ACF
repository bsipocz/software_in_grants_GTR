&lt;p>To establish a cross-cutting interdisciplinary research agenda on the relationships between ecosystem services, managed fire and wildfire in UK heaths and moorlands, especially implications of increased wildfire risk under projected climate change;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>To incorporate the needs of policy makers, moorland managers and other stakeholders, facilitate knowledge transfer to policy makers and contribute to adaptive management.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Methods: Four two-day workshops were held in Edinburgh, Manchester and the Peak District. The series was managed by a cross-disciplinary, cross-sector steering group. International and nationally-recognised academics and practitioners with expertise in key areas were invited. A website was set up (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fires-seminars.org.uk/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>www.fires-seminars.org.uk&lt;/a>), hosting the presentations and records of discussions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Outcomes: 50 of the 71 institutions attending were practitioner-based, including firefighters, academics, land owners, gamekeepers and conservation groups. The series was the first to engage UK Fire Services in sustained academic debate on wildfire. It attracted international participation from Europe and the USA, created a lively discussion forum, developed a UK-wide community of practice on wildfire and produced a widely-cited policy brief&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>23719</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Essex Count Fire &amp; Rescue Service</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>FIRES seminar series</gtr:description><gtr:id>F0842CA5-C91E-4D57-B5B9-D70321F4139B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Very much an interdisplinary and cross-sector collaboration bewtween human &amp;amp; physical geographers, geospatial scientists, social scientists, fire behaviour modellers, planners, economists, environmental scientists, fire officers, gamekeepers, conservation professionals, foresters, policy-makers, etc.

When do they break out? How do they behave once ignited? The official theme was 'Forecasting and Modelling Wildfire Risk for UK Moorlands and Heaths', but in practice the seminar ranged widely across Europe and California. There were no geographical boundaries to the discussion, either in the formal sessions or the lively coffee and meal breaks. 

Our NERC and ESRC sponsors are keen to encourage transdisciplinary and international exchange; the seminar succeeded spectacularly well in this respect. We were fortunate to have speakers from California, Portugal, Spain, Corsica and Italy, as well as contributors from the Fire and Rescue Services, Met Office, academic and many other sectors. The result was truly excellent debate. It brought home the mutual benefits of cross-disciplinary working and of and how much academics and fire-fighters can learn from each other.

Many important lessons emerged which will help to move knowledge and management of UK wildfires forward. These ranged from the importance of socio-economic drivers such as land abandonment via its impact on fuel management, to need for better wildfire reporting and fire-fighter training. Download the presentations and discussants reports to learn more.

Much good work goes on regionally but the UK needs a national policy on wildfire. The cross-sectorial impact of wildfire requires joined-up thinking by policy-makers - a topic which will be taken up in FIRES4.

There were actually three days of discussion. The international visitors enjoyed a field visit in the Peak District before the seminar, courtesy of the Peak District National Park Fire Operations group, which gave them an appreciation of UK wildfire issues and a chance to bounce on two metres of peat at the top of the Snake Pass.

1. We set up an experimental burns partnership between researchers from five Universities and two Fire Services. It resulted in two successful mutually beneficial field experiments in Northumberland and Dorset. Research questions about fire behaviour were devised jointly by researchers and fire officers. Fire officers carried out the burns as part of their wildfire training exercises. Researchers recorded fire behaviour and soil and vegetation pre- and post-fire. The land owners benefited from fuel reduction on their land. The initiative ultimately led to an SME called FireLab. 
2. A fire officer made a study visit to an international fire researcher in Corsica after they met at the seminar. The The fire officer brought the fire-fighting techniques seen there back to his own FRS.3.

Day One provided comprehensive information of the 'costs' of wildfires to policy makers that initiated discussion on the importance of wildfires and potential policy reforms to address wildfire risk reduction and fire-fighting policy and resourcing. The day started with a focus on the policy and practice of fighting moorland and heathland wildfires followed by a series of talks that provided an overview of the costs of wildfire suppression, their 'costs' on ecological services, local economies and costs to restore wildfire sites. The day culminated in a question and answer session to an invited policy panel, comprised of Jon Stewart (Natural England), Trevor Johnson, (Scottish Wildfire Forum), Malcolm Hay, (Heather Trust), Richard Campen, (Peak District National Park Authority) and Mark Jones (English Wildfire Forum).

The session was an excellent opportunity for researchers, fire-fighters and land managers to raise a series of questions of direct relevance to their interests that resulted in an incredibly insightful and interesting session.

Day Two focused on Adaptive Land Management (ALM) to reduce wildfire risk and impact. ALM is essentially 'learning by doing' but with a strong, built-in monitoring, evaluation and learning system. Within an ALM system, the impacts of changes in practice and policy are able to be assessed. After an introduction to this concept and its relevance to wildfire mitigation, there was a workshop session in which provided a cross-sector exercise to assess the perceived impact and knowledge of wildfire on ecosystem services, followed by development the necessary systems to test several land and fire management reforms on a 'real life' scenario. 

Take home message:
Economic evidence of the impact of wildfire was strongly identified as a key driver of future wildfire policy reforms. Robust and reliable evidence on the full economic impacts is therefore a priority, both to further develop best practice in wildfire mitigation (land management, improving preparedness) and suppression (fire-fighting), and inform and drive future policy reforms.

The contacts made in the seminar series have endured and grown (see FIRES1 for overall impacts). FIRES4 in particular showcased the work of the Peak District Fire Operations Group (FOG), and helped to encourage the formation of new fire groups. For example, FIRES4 co-host and steering group member, Moors for the Future (MFF) partnership, and myself were asked to provide wildfire risk mapping for the new South Pennines FOG in 2008, and also for Lancashire FOG in 2012. We have attended as invited observers at FOG group training exercises - a mark of the trust and co-operation built up through the FIRES seminar series.
With fellow steering group member, Jonathan Aylen (Manchester Business School), we advised MFF on a 'Be Fire Aware' interactive exhibit to raise public awareness of wildfire risk and its management in the Peak District National Park. It is based on our published work on wildfire forecasting and risk mapping. The resulting exhibit at the Moorland Centre in Edale opened in July 2014, with a second due to follow in the Upper Derwent Valley visitor centre. together they will reach an estimated 80,000 people a year.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5461175d99d818.65837528</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.fires-seminars.org.uk/programme/seminar4/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2009</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>FIRES2: The impact of wildfire on ecosystem services: relationships between wildfire, climate change and people</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C1DEA288-BB9B-4FCA-8E71-70CD93C9AA51</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Relationships between people, climate, the environment and fire are complex. The seminar reviewed the frequency, timing and distribution of wildfires in the UK. We examined UKCIP climate change scenarios and their implications for wildfire hazard and risk, managed burns and resulting fire regime. Critical questions addressed included how climate change will affect: vegetation vulnerability to fire; visitor pressure and potential sources of ignition; feedbacks between climate, vegetation and fire; and the impacts on ecosystem services of moorlands and heathlands. Over 50 people attended the event and more wanted to attend. Over half were practitioners from the land management community, fire services, nature conservation, etc.

Links established with the international keynote speaker from the US National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) led to the convenor (Julia McMorrow) presenting at two international Human Dimensions of Wildland Fire fireconferences in the US. The MoU signed in 2014 between the UK Chief Fire Officers' Association and the NFPA to introduce the Firewise program of community resilience to wildfire into the UK could be traced back to contacts made at the FIRES2 seminar.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-1857800681.01156572acbea7a</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.fires-seminars.org.uk/programme/seminar2/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2008</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>FIRES1 The Role of Managed Fire in Ecosystem Services of UK Moorlands and Heathlands</gtr:description><gtr:form>Scientific meeting (conference/symposium etc.)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>93AEA3F2-5E45-4CE9-A2AC-0461BA88061F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The two-day seminar reviewed how fire has been used historically, and the role of managed burning today. We identified the ecosystem services provided by UK moorlands and heathlands, including: biodiversity; carbon budget; water provision; rural livelihoods; landscape quality and recreational use. The focus for debate was the extent to which managed fires contribute to the maintenance of these ecosystem services or pose threats to them, especially with changes in policy.

This was the first of four two-day seminars, which ultimately led to the co-production of an influential policy brief on UK wildfire (which I led); http://www.fires-seminars.org.uk/downloads/FIRES_Policy_Brief_final.pdf This, in turn, also led to an invitation to join the England and Wales Wildfire Forum (EWWF) as one of only two academics (the other being a Manchester colleague, Professor John Dold, Mathematics). EWWF is the primary stakeholder forum for UK fire professionals and land management agencies involved in managing wildfire risk. It includes Fire and Rescue Services, Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG), DEFRA agencies (Natural England, Forestry Commission, Met Office), Cabinet Office Civil Contingencies Secretariat, MoD, Highways Agency, and non-government organisations such as the Heather Trust and CONFOR. The Chair acknowledges that its expansion in 2010 was facilitated by the community of practice and momentum established in the FIRES seminars. EWWF used the FIRES policy brief to raise the awareness of wildfire issues affecting UK FRS's by circulation to all Chief Fire Officers and members of the Chief Fire and Rescue Advisors Unit at the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG). The FIRES Policy Brief also formed a cornerstone of the discussions leading to the production of the inaugural EWWF Action Plan, and that of the Chief Fire Officers' Association (CFOA) Wildfire Group, formed in 2012.

2. Fires are costly to put out, and have long-term cost implications for ecosystem services. Treating ecosystem services as property assets would allow the costs of suppressing wildfires to be set against the avoided costs of damage to these services.

3. Partnership working is an effective and efficient approach to address the wildfire problem.

The top three policy recommendations were:

1. Establish a cross-sector wildfire risk assessment and integrate into management plans.

2. Support partnership working through local fire groups, where best practice can be shared.

3. Establish a combined wildfire strategy of prevention and suppression, including better fuel management and risk reduction.

The top three knowledge gaps were:

1. Data and procedures to improve the evidence base, including an accurate, spatially robust and accessible database on UK wildfires. 

2. Baseline regional fire regimes and how they are changing in response to land use, including clarifying the relationship between the occurrence of prescribed fire and wildfire. 

3. What are fire regimes would be need to achieve the management objectives of each ecosystem service under climate change scenarios.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The England and Wales Wildfire Forum (EWWF) has strongly endorsed the policy brief as an excellent summary of the UK wildfire issue. They sent it to all Chief Fire Officers and to members of the Chief Fire and Rescue Advisors Unit at the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) to improve awareness of UK wildfire risk. It was used by the Cabinet Office and Government Departments in reviewing wildfire risk, and was endorsed by the Natural Hazard Partnership. 

The policy brief formed the basis of discussions for the EWWF Action Plan and later in 2012 for the new Chief Fire Officers' Association Wildfire Group's action plan.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D048EB20-0BA5-4DF9-89AC-B44607B041B0</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-7077087524.4188774bffc0</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment,Transport,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.fires-seminars.org.uk/downloads/FIRES_Policy_Brief_final.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3A607210-7EDF-49AC-9044-024007F8995A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Climate change and the future occurrence of moorland wildfires in the Peak District of the UK</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Climate Research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/18754a6b0caf45b4b8ac7be0f7299492"><gtr:id>18754a6b0caf45b4b8ac7be0f7299492</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Albertson K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cfbefbe52e13d7</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>099C2651-DEC0-4408-A4A7-4B7480904D5E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Fire Interdisciplinary Research on Ecosystem Services (FIRES) Policy Brief</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/0c125c3c5fbe9e03db5d84823a085ac3"><gtr:id>0c125c3c5fbe9e03db5d84823a085ac3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>McMorrow.
