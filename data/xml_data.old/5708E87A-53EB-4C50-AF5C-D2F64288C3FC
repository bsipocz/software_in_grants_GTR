The Company has two proprietary and synergistic software platforms &amp;quot;Taxonomy3&amp;reg;&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Conformetrix&amp;quot; that provide a significant competitive advantage when combined with an experienced management team. &amp;quot;Taxonomy3&amp;reg;&amp;quot; is a human genetics analysis platform that utilises a unique mathematical approach to discovery and validation of drug targets for the treatment of a variety of diseases. &amp;quot;Conformetrix&amp;quot; determines the 3D shape of drug molecules from experimental in vitro data that enables the rapid design and discovery of novel and potent drugs for diseases with high unmet medical need across broad therapeutic areas. C4XD's drug discovery engine was further strengthened by the acquisition of technologies from Molplex Ltd, in 2016, which included a software-based system which combines chemoinformatics, computational chemistry and artificial intelligence to optimise the drug discovery process. We have a hybrid business model of wholly-owned programmes and partnerships with pharma, biotech and academics.

The Company was founded as a spin-out from the University of Manchester and has a highly experienced management team and Board who have delivered significant value creation within the healthcare sector historically.</gtr:description><gtr:id>BDE5A59D-2E61-45DE-80E6-87C8EE2250B8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>C4X Discovery operates a hybrid business model of a wholly owned pipeline of discovery programmes plus partnerships with global and international companies, from top 10 pharma through to biotech. The Company is partnered with the Structural Genomic Consortium to assist with the identification and validation of new drug targets and has several active research collaborations with academic institutions.

By 2012 Conformetrix disclosed its first collaborative deal with AstraZeneca. Mike Snowden, Vice President and Head of Discovery Sciences, AstraZeneca, said at the time: &amp;quot;We are excited to be working with Conformetrix. We believe their technology will provide a powerful addition to our hit identification and lead optimization approaches, supporting our strategic objectives to improve the quality and choice of candidate compounds for our early pipeline.&amp;quot; In addition to an undisclosed upfront payment, Conformetrix received research funding and was eligible for milestones as certain targets are met. At the end of 2012 Conformetrix announced that it had used its technology to generate a series of potent orexin (OX-1) antagonists, with plans to progress to drug leads. Orexin is a neurotransmitter believed to play a role in a broad range of behavioral conditions, from sleep disorders to addiction.
In 2013 Conformetrix was rebranded to C4XDiscovery Ltd and in the same year announced how its proprietary NMR-based technology could be used to solve the dynamic solution-structure of a small molecule antagonist of the Class B GPCR corticotropin-releasing factor receptor (CRF-1R) in just seven days. In 2014 C4XDiscovery announced new collaboration deals with Takeda Pharmaceuticals and Evotec AG. Furthermore, the company published further positive data and announced a patent filing for its selective OX-1 inhibitor programme for stress-related addictive disorders. On the basis of these positive corporate results, and to maintain investment in C4XDiscovery's programmes, the company successfully floated on the London Stock Exchange in an Oct 2014 IPO, valuing the company at &amp;pound;31m. Further announcements since then: 2014. Renewed collaboration with Evotec AG, including co-development of selective OX-1 inhibitors. 2015. Selection of drug candidate from OX-1 programme to enter pre-clinical development. New collaboration with Structural Genomics Consortium at Oxford University. Small molecule leads against IL-17 for inflammation and autoimmune diseases. Breakthrough compounds for diabetes and inflammation. 2016. Appointment of Clive Dix as Chief Executive Officer. Acquisition of Adorial Limited (a genetic analysis company). Acquisition of MolPlex Limited (drug-discovery technologies). Further &amp;pound;5m fundraise. New strategic multi-target, risk-sharing alliance with Evotec AG.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6b210c438d1.84336748</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:url>http://www.c4xdiscovery.com</gtr:url><gtr:yearCompanyFormed>2008</gtr:yearCompanyFormed></gtr:spinOutOutput></gtr:spinOutOutputs></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/F528081/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
