Studies of the development of coarticulatory patterns in children have produced conflicting results concerning adult-child differences. This research compares coarticulatory properties of speech in children and adults, using innovative articulatory measures derived from ultrasound imaging. The aims are to establish how children?s patterns of coarticulation differ from adults?, and to attempt to explain the observed coarticulatory patterns, as well as the nature and the degree of variability found in adults and children.
&lt;br />
&lt;br />Synchronised ultrasound and acoustic data will be recorded using the Queen Margaret University ultrasound system. Consonant-vowel syllables in real sentences will be produced by ten normally developing children aged 7 years, and ten adults, all speakers of Standard Scottish English. Child and adult productions will be compared according to an ultrasound-based measure of coarticulation, and any significant differences in amount of coarticulation and degree of within-speaker variability will be established. Qualitative examination of individual variation will help to establish the nature of any differences between children and adults in the organisational structure of speech in terms of segments, syllables and words.

The event had very positive feedback from children, teachers and parents.

Specifically, the postalveolar fricative was coarticulated more in the children than in the adults, while the alveolar fricative did not show evidence of coarticulation in the children. These findings suggest that developmental shifts in the degree of coarticulation of individual speech sounds may be affected by changes in articulatory constraints on the tongue with age.

The results also showed that adults and children differ in the degree of individual variability in coarticulatory patterns, children being more variable than adults. The strong within-speaker variability may be because the children are still in the process of tuning their speech production system to the adult-like degree of trade-off between speed of tongue movement, speech timing and amount of tongue travel.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>- The database collected during the project is available to academics and students upon request
