A number of Iron Age &amp;quot;proto-towns&amp;quot; - oppida -are known or suspected including Wheathampstead, Verulamium/St Albans, Welches Farm and Braughing. Some of these sites developed into the towns of the Roman period including the major site at Verulamium, the third largest town in the province. As well as the towns, a network of rural sites ranging from Roman villas to modest farmsteads existed, probably as many as one per square kilometre. In places, the pre-Roman field systems have survived to the modern day.
Although much research has been conducted on both the towns and the rural sites, for example the excavations at Verulamium, Gorhambury, Baldock, Dicket Mead and Chells, there is still much we do not know about the layout of these sites and their relationship to each other. Excavation, perhaps the best known archaeological research technique, is expensive and slow and can only look at relatively small areas. Aerial photography, especially the 100% survey commissioned by Hertfordshire CC in 2010, has added many new sites and information to our understanding, but is less good for producing more detailed plans of sites, especially the smaller rural sites.

This project, therefore, aims to examine a variety of Iron Age and Roman sites across the county using geophysical survey techniques, principally magnetometry. By using a magnetometer we can create plans of what lies beneath the soil without having to resort to excavation. Although lacking in the chronological precision of excavation, it can provide a valuable intermediate level of data between the aerial image and an excavated site. We will be surveying the Roman town at Verulamium as well as other sites across the county. The survey results will be combined and examined using GIS.

The project is formed of a coalition of interested groups including the Institute of Archaeology, UCL, the Welwyn Archaeological Society, the St Albans and Hertfordshire Architectural and Archaeological Society, the North Hertfordshire Archaeological Society, the Welwyn Hatfield and St Albans branches of the Young Archaeologists Club, Welwyn Hatfield Museum Service, St Albans Museums, St Albans City Council and the Hertfordshire Historic Environment Record. Training is being provided in the use of an advanced cart-based magnetometer for undertaking these surveys across the county. In addition, a week long summer school will be run for any community heritage group member.

The results of this project will allow us to examine issues such as the layout and development of Verulamium, the nature of the numerous enclosures in the county, and the pattern of rural settlement. The results will also be fed back into the Herts Historic Environment Record to help them protect our county's heritage. The progress of the project can be followed via the project's website and blog, and the results will be published and presented in a variety of places including a one day conference at the end of the project.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The impact of this project can be divided into two areas: the impact of the results of the research and the impact of the process of the research.
The four main groups of beneficiaries are: academia (principally archaeologists and ancient historians but potentially also geophysicists), the public sector (specifically the Hertfordshire Historic Environment Record, and the various collaborating museum services), the general public (largely members of community heritage groups such as the archaeological societies and the Young Archaeologists Clubs, but also individuals) and possibly schools if we can build links via the YACs.

The first two groups are likely to benefit most (but not exclusively) from the results of the research, the latter groups will benefit from both the results and the process.

Academia

The impact on academia has largely been explored in the &amp;quot;Academic Beneficiaries&amp;quot; section of this application. In addition to the issues discussed there, academia will benefit from building a closer relationship with the community heritage groups involved as well as, more broadly, disseminating information about the project and how those relationships were built. Knowledge exchange is also two-way: local community groups have detailed knowledge of their area, often unpublished. 

Public Sector

The Hertfordshire HER has a responsibility for protecting and managing the archaeological resource in the county and does this via maintaining the record, and advising the planning authorities and developers. By feeding back the results of the project to the HER this will &amp;quot;increase... the quality of the advice that the HCC Historic Environment Unit provides in responding to development proposals and agri-environment schemes&amp;quot; (Bryant, in letter of support). In addition, the collaboration of the HHER with the community heritage groups will improve the latter's understanding of the role of the HHER and its potential. The district archaeologist for St Albans City Council fulfills a similar role at a more local level, and the benefits to the City Council are similar. Local museums are clearly a major contributor to the cultural heritage of the UK but the current economic crisis has put them under great financial pressure, and indeed many have been closed down, e.g., Harlow. By facilitating the work of the project and then helping to display and disseminate the results, the local museums involved will be able to build even stronger links to community groups and with academia, and demonstrate their irreplaceable role in the cultural life of the nation.

The general public

The community heritage groups involved will benefit in many ways. 1) By gaining the results of the surveys for the sites/landscapes they are involved and interested in. 2) By gaining skills in geophysical survey and access to advanced equipment including beyond the end of the project. 3) By making their groups and activities more publicly visible to a wider range of people. 4) Via 3, helping to build up and increase their membership and 5) by the creation of an informal network of community heritage groups across the county. In addition, the archaeological societies which mainly consist of older people will have the opportunity to work alongside the younger members of the YAC allowing both groups to appreciate the perspectives of the other.

Schools

At present the project core team does not include any school groups. We will, however, contact six-form colleges/schools with sixth formers with a view to creating links and involving interested teenagers in the work of the project. The pupils will benefit from training, contact with university based academics, and contact with archaeological society members.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>66733</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Berkhamsted &amp; District Archaeological Society</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Cross 'community heritage group' collaborations</gtr:description><gtr:id>B11105A3-FC79-449F-A568-1E0A68DEEE6E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Outcomes (survey results, training, lectures, etc.) detailed in other parts of the entry for this grant.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5464adb90f0790.16110084-5</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The partners provide: man power; sites suitable for analysis; logistical help, storage room, lecture space, data and so forth.

Communities Scheme. As such, the grant was as much about the process as the immediate research outcomes. A number of groups have benefited from the research in varying ways and at varying levels.

Firstly, and most obviously, the attendees at the week-long course in archaeological geophysics held at Verulamium benefited from training in geophysics taught by world-leaders in the field. This represents a unique opportunity for this level of tuition and field training, especially for community heritage group members. The course evaluations were extremely positive and we have oft been asked if we are likely to re-run the course.

The second group to benefit from the activities of the project were those who participated in the surveys. By practical experience, they can now plan and undertake surveys of their own. Since the end of the project grant seven further surveys have been undertaken and a substantial new area of Verulamium surveyed. This group has formed the Community Archaeology Geophysics Group, a loose cross-archaeological society organisation which aims to undertake surveys for local community heritage groups.

As part of the activities of the project, members of the Young Archaeologists Club were introduced to geophysics. We also contributed to an event run jointly between the Prehistoric Society and YAC.

In the process of surveying Verulamium Park, a very large number of interested passers-by spoke to members of the project team. This enabled us to both pass on information about geophysics and the project, but also about Verulamium itself and what lies beneath the turf of the Park increasing awareness of this internationally important site. Additionally, by pointing members of the public towards the project blog, they are able to access the results of all the surveys only days after they took place.

In terms of disseminating the results, so far seventeen lectures have been delivered to community heritage groups in the county probably reaching some 750 people or more, and three more are scheduled; two lectures have been given to local archaeology/history conferences; four lectures have been given to more academic audiences including to CAA in Paris, the Near Surface Geophysics Group meeting in London and to the RGK in Frankfurt; training has also been given to the 'St Albans Blue Badge Guides' the official
guides for the city.

As well as the academic information provided by the surveys, the results are of use to statutory bodies. For example, the survey of Verulamium Park allows the St Albans and District Council, the St Albans Museum Service and the Hertfordshire Historic Environment Record (HER) to update their GIS/databases both adding in new information and correcting the location of known features (the Urban Archaeological Database and the HHER's GIS maps are inaccurate). The other sites surveyed by the project (Broom Hall Farm, Lower Sacombe, Gatesbury, Ashwell, Latimer, Sarrat, Page's Park) will enhance the Herts HER, contributing towards their ability to influence the planning process.

Lastly, the various societies from which the team members were drawn are benefitting by access to the results for their particular sites. For example, the Welwyn Archaeological Society are planning to excavate some of the features revealed by the survey at Broom Hall Farm, the Leighton Buzzard Society now has information to allow them to investigate the archaeology of Page's Park in an informed way.

The continued access to the equipment purchased by the project as well as the PI's continuing involvement with the Societies and CAGG ensures that the influence of the project is continuing to be felt long after the end of the grant. This year, access to UCL's dGPS has greatly aided the work, and the loan of SEAHA's Ground Penetrating Radar has greatly increased the range of results obtained and skills learnt.

Update for 2017.
The team now have access to an advanced RM85 Earth Resistance Meter and a dGPS adding to the range of surveys they can undertake. A further 16 lectures have been presented, mainly to local archaeological societies. The blog continues to be popular with a 106 postings. The project and the team goes from strength to strength despite having no funding for the last three years.

The project was used as an example of the way community archaeology can significantly add to knowledge by Dr Philip Perkins at a day conference in Rome (8th November 2016) during his plenary address and as part of the round table discussions.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>FD54E23E-0EDC-43A5-ABCB-65D62514C512</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>544101df840501.88037821</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project aimed to undertake a range of geophysical surveys on
late Iron Age and Roman sites in the county and nearby. To this
end, over a dozen sites have been surveyed: Broom Hall Farm, Watton at
Stone; The Senuna Site, Ashwell; Gatesbury, Braughing; Little
Hadham; Verulamium, St. Albans; Datchworth; Sarratt; Latimer;
Page's Park, Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire; Cholesbury, Buckinghamshire, Bushey Hall, Watford. As is expected, not
all the surveys revealed significant features, either because of
the lack of them, or because the technique used failed to detect
them. Latimer and Sarratt Roman villas are good examples of the
former problem, Gatesbury, Braughing, of the latter. In the case of
Verulamium, Ashwell, Broom Hall Farm, Little Hadham and Page's
Park, the surveys have been spectacularly successful.

To highlight these successful results, I will concentrate on the
surveys at Verulamium. The first tranche of surveys were in the Park. This represents approximately one half
of the town, the third largest in Roman Britain. The entire town was surveyed using magnetometry at 20 readings per m. The survey took approximately 45 days over the period June 2013 to February 2014 and covers approximately 40ha. Knowledge of the plan of the town had previously been derived from the excavations of the Wheelers in the 1930s and Frere in the 60s. Some features were known from parch marks in the grass of the Park. The survey located many of the known features such as the so-called '1955 ditch' (the late first century boundary of the town) and some of the buildings partially investigated by Wheeler. The survey has, however, identified many new buildings across the town. Most appear to be town houses. Additionally, a number of pottery kilns have been identified along with large numbers of pits, hearths, ditches and other features. To highlight two: there is a ditch which goes from the SW corner of the 1955 ditch towards the 3rd century town walls. To the east of this ditch many structures and features can be seen, the north/west the data is very quiet. This ditch may represent a second century expansion of the town's limits to incorporate a busy suburb. The second example is a ditch with a rounded corner which is partly overlain by the southern bank of the third century walls. This seems likely to be a religious enclosure paralleled at Baldock. Other surveys have taken place incuding GPR which is revealing excellent details of the stone buildings and magnetic susceptibility which may show the extent of the second century fire.

As reported last year, it was hoped to extend the survey into the Gorhambury Estate. We were allowed to do this in August 2015 completing 18 survey days and collecting 17.5ha of magnetometry data and 4ha of GPR data. The results are spectacular and include the location of the town's aqueduct. Access to a GPR has led to further work in the Park as well. The surveys will continue in 2017.

The project has also created a new network of local amateur
geophysicists backed by UCL, and provided skills training in the field.

Update for 2017. The project has now completed 64.5ha of magnetometry at Verulamium, almost the entire available area within the town walls. The project has examined 21 sites over four years.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The outcomes of the project are already being taken forward.

For example, the results of the Watton-at-Stone survey has enabled the Welwyn Archaeological Society to plot metal detected finds on the subsurface features to better understand the nature of the site. The Society is planning to excavate some of the features revealed by the survey, as well as expanding the survey to the west.

The Leighton Buzzard Society were interested in a 19th century references to a Roman well in Page's Park. The survey has allowed them to identify potential archaeological features in the Park for further investigation.

The societies from which the participating members were drawn now have a resource on which they can call to undertake surveys fundamental to their own research activities.

The PI wishes to continue the investigations into Verulamium in collaboration with the local groups and statutory bodies. In
particular, further surveys are needed (especially on the other
