In this regard, Brazil is a forerunner, a potential model to other societies (Harris 2014). In reality, access is a serious problem and rationing of services takes place through long waiting times, which vary across procedures and regions, and this has led to emergence of a private health sector. So, despite increased access to basic health care for a major part of the poorer population over the last two decades, concerns about inequalities in access to health are a first order policy concern in Brazil. The extent of these inequalities in access is currently unknown, since they cannot be correctly inferred from the anecdotal and aggregate data that are typically used in public debate.
Our proposal contains the following core elements-
1. To identify and assess inequalities in access to health care by socio-economic position gender and region. We will analyse trends by type of morbidity and, hence, implicitly by age.
2. To assess the impact of the expansion of state-provided primary health care services on the evolution of these inequalities, with a focus on access to hospital treatment and, conditional upon access, on treatment expenditures and recovery outcomes.

There is a vast literature on health inequalities but this typically looks at inequalities in outcomes. We focus instead on inequalities in access which is moot because Brazil (like the UK) has a commitment to equality in access to public health. Even with equal access, inequalities in outcomes, which involve family histories and individual behaviours, may persist. For instance, poverty is closely linked to infectious disease and the tendency towards depression tends to vary by gender. 

The Family Health Program (PSF), the most significant innovation within SUS, placed professional teams in local communities, focusing upon prevention and early detection. We will address our second objective, which is to evaluate how expansion of the PSF across states was associated with the changing profile of health inequalities across states using administrative data on trends in PSF-coverage. Using this we will track a major recent expansion of the program to ask: How did PSF impact infectious disease? To what extent did it influence chronic disease, possibly through behavioural change? Did the PSF, by addressing problems early enough, lower hospital admission rates and did this, in turn, reduce crowding and improve outcomes [quality] in hospitalization data? How did the PSF influence who gets admitted to hospital, and how did it thereby influence health inequalities?

To address the first objective of documenting inequalities in access to health, we propose to use administrative hospitalization records from SUS and the Brazilian Household Survey. The hospital data provide individual-level information since the mid-1990s on admissions, main diagnosis, length of stay, procedures, expenditures, mortality outcomes, and characteristics, including age, gender, education and state. Access to a census of hospitalization is rare, permitting analyses potentially useful outside the Brazilian-context. We will combine survey and hospital data to profile access to healthcare.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>ODA Compliance 
This project assesses poverty and economic development issues including population health and trends in the relative position of the poor. In principle Brazil is a model for public health provision. In practice it is plagued by inequalities in other domains that interfere with its objective to provide universal health coverage. Brazil's Family Health Program shifted health-care provision from a centralized model structured around public hospitals in urban areas to a decentralized one involving local communities. This has led to increased inclusion of the poor and improvements in infectious disease but less is known about inequality in chronic disease and access to more complex care.

We will conduct the research effectively, using non-parametric techniques to describe inequality and econometric methods of policy evaluation (Sonia's skills, well-represented in ISER, the UK host institution). We will use rich, fairly unique data sources. All three applicants have publication records of internationally excellent standards. Rudi Rocha from Brazil is a junior colleague who will spend several weeks at a stretch in the UK, working with Sonia, attending seminars and workshops in Essex and London.

Beneficiaries
The project is expected to yield evidence relevant to poverty, inequality and public health provision in Brazil with wider relevance to other developing countries and in fact also to richer countries insofar as it assesses performance of a state-funded universal health coverage plan. In addition to producing evidence for policy, it will advance an academic literature in the domains of poverty and public health.

Benefits of the Research Partnership
The benefit of the proposed collaboration to UK research is multi-fold. Research on health and health provision in Brazil stands to inform UK health policy. The data sources for Brazil are better at least insofar as they have administrative hospital records. The issues at the forefront of our research in Brazil viz non-communicable disease management, hospital crowding and waiting times, and inequalities in health are at the forefront of discussions pertaining to health in the UK. Like the UK and in contrast to many developing nations, Brazil offers free universal health coverage but, like the UK, it faces quality issues. Rodrigo has an established reputation for his work on health and Rudi is a rising star in the area, so Sonia will enjoy direct scholarly benefits from this collaboration. It is likely to have spillovers. A junior colleague in Essex has already exhibited an interest in following our research agenda using UK data, and we will explore this when Rudi visits. Sonia Bhalotra has considerable experience of research in health, development and gender and she brings a fresh external perspective to meld with that of her Brazilian colleagues. 

As regards relevance to current Research Council funding, Sonia is co-investigator on MiSoc, the ESRC research centre at Essex. Her MiSoc-research investigates health innovations and health inequalities using a combination of historical and contemporary data on the US, Sweden and Norway. The proposed analysis set in Brazil will complement and enhance this agenda, with positive knowledge externalities in both directions. 

The need for international collaboration runs in both directions. Sonia benefits directly from access to Brazilian data (even where public, this in documented in Portugese) and from the intricate knowledge of current policy debates that her Brazilian colleagues have. Rudi and Rodrigo benefit from Sonia's knowledge of health in several other countries. The team have complementary skills in economics and econometrics. Rodrigo and Sonia already have an international network of co-authors but neither, at present, has a UK-Brazil link and this is something we are all enthusiastic about developing and taking forward.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>77525</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Health and Gender: Global and Economic Perspectives</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>717FFBBC-82E6-4778-9C6E-3CAFBB662DA4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Organized international conference on health in Sept 2016 in Essex to mark closure of this award</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>585149f3685450.00214454</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.iser.essex.ac.uk/events/conferences/2016-09-23</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Under Engagement: Presented research to a physician from the School of Medicine in S?o Paulo, Dept of Pediatrics</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>68ECF2E0-61DE-40BD-B77B-175842E0F9C1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Under Engagement: Prof Rudi Rocha (co-investigator) presented our research to a physician from the School of Medicine in S&amp;atilde;o Paulo, Dept of Pediatrics in September 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5857f91bf3adb7.69438465</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Under Engagement: Presented research to members of the Ministry of Socio-Development in Brasilia</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>95EDE258-9641-4DA9-95CE-90BDAF741BD5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Under Engagement: Prof Rudi Rocha (co-investigator) presented our research to members of the Ministry of Socio-Development in Brasilia in September 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5857f84cd8ff90.72075403</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Under Engagement: mentioned our research results at a British Academy Panel Debate on Global Inequalities</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>056FD89C-11E4-4CF3-8C25-612B36B87BBB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Under Engagement: Prof Sonia Bhalotra (PI) made mention of our research results at a British Academy Panel Debate on Global Inequalities on 29 Nov at the Royal Society in London, where she was a panellist who discussed maternal and child health and universal health coverage.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5857fc728198c4.54171717</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Under Engagement: presented our research at Fiocruz, Bahia</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E8FAA426-93BE-440A-83C5-90EA231FEA3E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Under Engagement: Prof Rudi Rocha (co-investigator) presented our research at Fiocruz, Bahia - Salvador (Brazil) in August 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5857fa1878afb7.07094093</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop health</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>96DD5082-AC2D-485B-8556-023DCD782A2B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I organized a workshop with the funding in this award at ISER Essex in December 2015.

A pillar of this effort was the Family Health Program (PSF), a community-based public health initiative that began in 1994 and that for the first time led to remote and rural areas being provided with primary health care facilities. However, alongside a massive extension of primary care, there was a decline in hospital facilities and medical specialists per capita. It is therefore important to analyse if any benefits from wider inclusion in primary care were at the cost of reduced access to hospital care for possibly more severe conditions. 

We merged administrative data on births, deaths, facilities and hospitalization with data on programme rollout by municipality. Exploiting the staggered rollout of the programme across municipalities in an event study approach designed to isolate causal effects, we find that PSF penetration was associated with large and sustained declines in maternal mortality and in foetal, neonatal and postneonatal mortality among children. Overall, there is no significant change in mortality from chronic diseases. We document improved access to health care, which suggests that supply side factors played an important part in determining reductions in mortality. In particular, we find PSF-driven increases in prenatal care visits, the probability of hospital birth, and hospitalization for infants for conditions not amenable to primary care. There is hence no evidence of adverse consequences of declining hospital facilities, rather the rationalization of public resources achieved through re-structuring, successfully extended coverage for basic reproductive and childhood health services. 

However we find no improvements in birth weight or APGAR scores, two commonly used indicators of the quality of births. We argue that this can be explained by the composition of live births becoming increasingly high-risk through two PSF-related outcomes: first, reduced foetal mortality, which implies negative selection into birth and, second, reduced fertility, especially among more educated women, which implies that the marginal child was increasingly born of the higher risk less-educated woman.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Recently, in 2016, Larry Summers led a group of prominent economists petitioning for Universal Health Coverage. Many countries have limited coverage, with coverage skewed in favour of the rich. Moreover, health systems are often focused upon cure rather than prevention. The Brazilian programme we investigate illustrates for the rest of the world the design of and the feasibility of a relatively low cost community-based primary health care initiative, showing that it has significant impacts on maternal and child survival, and fertility. Among mechanisms we identify for this are improved prenatal care and assisted delivery.

The Sustainable Development Goals released in September 2015, while this research was in progress, explicitly refer to Universal Health Coverage and the universality of reproductive and neonatal health services as targets within Goal 3 on Health. At a British Academy public debate on Global Inequalities, Sonia Bhalotra discussed UHC in Brazil as an example to other countries, richer and poorer. In meetings at the World Health Organization coordinated by the Assistant Director General, Flavia Bustreo, Sonia Bhalotra found a lot of sympathy for an agenda determining rights to health, and hence universal coverage, with an initial focus on &amp;quot;every woman and every child&amp;quot;.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>ED96FAF7-609E-41D6-8671-1135ACEDF40A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56df179782cba7.92463978</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www.iser.essex.ac.uk/research/publications/working-papers/iser/2016-16</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>We have merged a census of hospitalization records with information on the municipality level roll out of the family health insurance program and municipality level birth and death registers.</gtr:description><gtr:id>50D1364B-2D2C-4A52-9E0E-76969232E44B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We are continuing to build these data with a new British Academy research award starting now, integrating more administrative data with the existing data to create &amp;quot;big data&amp;quot;.
