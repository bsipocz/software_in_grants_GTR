A huge amount of work over many years has sought to understand how synapses are formed (and, often, eliminated) during development. This is now an increasingly relevant goal, as it is believed that many neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism and schizophrenia, may result from disruptions to the process of synapse formation. Therefore, a greater understanding of these processes could lead to new biomarkers or even treatments for these disorders.

This proposal focuses on the role of neuronal activity in synapse formation. It has long been understood that activity can determine whether synapses are maintained or eliminated after they have been formed. Our recently published work, together with new preliminary data, now suggests that a particular form of activity, namely spontaneous neurotransmitter release, may in fact operate earlier in development to drive synapse formation itself. Our goal in this study is to examine how two different forms of neurotransmitter release (that evoked by neuronal firing, and that occurring spontaneously) regulate the formation of, and ultimately numbers of, different types of mammalian central nervous system synapses.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Neuronal activity, in the form of action potential firing driving the release of neurotransmitter from presynaptic terminals, has long been known to be important in determining whether developing synapses are maintained or eliminated. However, neurons also release neurotransmitter spontaneously, and do so at exceptionally high levels early in development. Until recently, very little was known about the role that spontaneous release might play during development. We found that in cultured rodent hippocampal neurons the spontaneous release of glutamate was important to drive the growth of dendrites. We now have preliminary data indicating that it may regulate synapse formation itself. The goal of this proposal is to dissect out the different roles of these two types of neurotransmitter release, evoked and spontaneous, on the formation of synapses in the mammalian central nervous system. We will compare mice which lack key synaptic vesicle cycling proteins that differentially affect these two forms of release to determine how synaptic densities are affected early in brain development in the intact animal. We will then take advantage of various ex-vivo and in vitro preparations, using a combination of imaging, electrophysiology and genetically encoded reporters of presynaptic function, to relate levels of different modes of transmitter release at specific stages of development to the formation of both excitatory and inhibitory synapses in individual pyramidal neurons.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Potential beneficiaries of this work include pharmaceutical companies, patients with neurodevelopmental disorders and their families, and the wider public.

This research proposal aims to understand fundamental mechanisms underlying the development of neuronal connections, and how different types of neuronal activity may regulate this. This work will have immediate implications for research into neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia, where synapse formation and function are widely believed to be disrupted. We believe that furthering our knowledge of physiology in these areas will lead to a greater understanding of pathogenesis and, in the longer term, eventually to new therapeutic approaches, with potentially significant benefit to the health and well-being of society. Should any results show potential for commercial exploitation, this would generate concurrent R&amp;amp;D investment and economic benefits to companies (possibly targeted for UK-based ones), collaborating research institutions and other involved sectors, as well as eventual use in clinical practice with obvious benefits to patients.

Through our efforts to increase knowledge about how the brain develops to children, families and in schools, we hope to inspire a new generation to contribute to the immense challenge of improving our understanding of brain function and the attempts to treat its pathology. Involvement with schools will have an additional beneficial societal impact. We can try and improve the understanding of neuroscience, and particularly the importance of researching basic questions, of the general public through public engagement schemes which could have indirect benefits for society in general.

Finally, staff working on the project would develop various potentially transferable skills such as computing/IT/programming abilities and innovative approaches to problem solving. In addition, the researcher will attend the Kings College London Researcher Development Program, which includes a choice of training courses on multiple transferable skills.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-04-17</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-04-18</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>330712</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>563472CA-99B6-4E1D-9D6D-6CCB3296BFF8</gtr:id><gtr:title>The role of spontaneous neurotransmission in synapse and circuit development.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of neuroscience research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/076ac1182e5f4bb5afaf56e709660eeb"><gtr:id>076ac1182e5f4bb5afaf56e709660eeb</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Andreae LC</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0360-4012</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a8d79ef301364.18666272</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/P000479/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>48D25546-6ADF-479A-8877-478CCDB1DC1F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Animal Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>A442BF36-F335-483E-9282-F3BB48AC2C47</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cell biology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C23BE70F-1EF6-4CC7-88B0-841CB18DD875</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Genetics &amp; development</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9898EFC8-73AB-4E1E-A207-04A486D9F1A9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Animal developmental biology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>73EF98E1-3FA8-46A0-BE46-00AE16C7D999</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Communication &amp; signalling</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F439A20B-A9B0-4A68-B703-7F6AE7570E39</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Systems neuroscience</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
