&lt;p>The ethical research focuses on preventive counter-terrorism activity and preventive action against organised crime, in particular the problems surrounding the interpretation of ?proportionateness? in preventive police operations. The research focuses critically on the claim that preventive counter-terrorism moves policing unjustly in the direction of pre-cognition of crime and abandoning the presumption of innocence. It also investigates critically the supposed special connections between justice and reactive policing, and the supposed tensions between justice and security as the presiding values of policing. The moral differences between terrorism and some of the main kinds of organised crime are also discussed.&lt;/p>

&lt;p> The Leadership function of the project will involve interaction with other GU-funded projects for the purpose of identifying such risks and helping researchers to accommodate them, and even to write about them. Another function of the research will be to organise interactions between GU-supported researchers, companies in the UK and European security sector, and ethicists. Such interactions have been pioneered by the PI in previous European research.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>End-users involved in previous research I have led are likely to benefit from end-user interactions proposed for this project. These beneficiaries include Rory Doyle of Smiths Detection, Ehud Givon, CEO of WeCu Technologies in Israel, Erik Bladh of Axis Technology in Sweden and Olov F&amp;auml;st, General Manager of the Swedish Space Corporation. A range of end-users from counter terrorism policing and intelligence would also be interested in this project. David Page (now retired, but working for Special Branch during the period of DETECTER) and Grant Moss (formerly of West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit, now head of security at Queen Elizabeth Hospital) are two who might be mentioned. In addition to these, we have strong contacts among serving CT and serious crime officers from Merseyside, PSNI, West Mids and West Yorkshire as well as the Met and ACPO. I think that two ex-heads of GCHQ would be interested: Sir Francis Richards and Sir David Pepper. The SURVEILLE project end-user group will make available an international group of police end-users. There is also access to an end-user group in SURVEILLE made up of security officials in urban local authorities throughout Europe. Then there are legal and policy-making officials. Among NGO and Human rights agency representatives whom I have worked with in the past, Bjarte Vandvik, Secretary General of the European Council on Refugees and Exiles, and Martina Huber, Programme Manager of Social Research for the Fundamental Rights Agency, are two I think would be prepared to confirm the value of the research.Finally in the area of policy making beneficiaries, I would name Timothy Cooper, Principal Research Officer of Research &amp;amp; Development Unit to FRONTEX (the External Borders Agency) and B&amp;eacute;n&amp;eacute;dicte Havelange, of the Office of the European Data Protection Supervisor. Dr Cooper has commissioned research from me on border security issues, and Ms Havelange is a lawyer expert in in data-protection.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>348319</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Coventry University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>'Shades of Grey' Global Uncertainties project ethics input</gtr:description><gtr:id>B6320309-739A-4791-A244-03B6323A8D5C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The collaboration spans computer science, psychology, and philosophy.

By 'Digilantism' we mean a kind of punishing exposure of wrongdoing to a digital community, e.g. by YouTube posts. Famous examples with a source in the UK are postings of video of a woman putting a cat in a rubbish bin and racist rants on the London Underground. Such postings can lead to the identification of the perpetrators, and both trolling and police action against them. Among the questions raised by this activity is whether it is a criticizable departure from the rule of law, whether it is a fair form of public disapproval, and what happens if some of the reaction is extreme, or if people in video are misidentified? The day focused on a series of 'provocations' from invited speakers - including Karen Salt (Aberdeen), Shaun Lawson (Lincoln), Carl Miller (Demos) to stimulate discussion to identify the key research challenges and opportunities in this area and to explore potential collaborations for future work.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cc23c90beaf1.97504557</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Masterclass on cyberwarfare ethics for intelligence community</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E2B335C2-E9D5-4022-9214-1F4C357BF7F4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Commissioned day-long course on the ethics of cyberwarfare for practitioners.

Background

The trade of illicit goods puts a significant burden on the UK economy. Illicit trade amounts to around &amp;pound;90bn each year. All parts of the retail sector suffer with consumers often unaware of the dangers of fake toys, clothing, cosmetics, tobacco and medicines. Additionally, businesses lose trade to &amp;quot;black market&amp;quot; goods, and manufacturers suffer reputational damage through illicitly branded products. 

Meanwhile, public agencies are fighting to ensure standards are maintained across the retail sector as well as tackling the sale of counterfeit goods. Recognising the rising problem of illicit trading, the 2015 Budget increased funding to combat the problem.


Notes

Peter Nelson
? Sales of counterfeit cigarettes lose HMRC about &amp;pound;2B per annum
? 10-14% of cigarettes are illicit, in a different study KPMG rate illicit trade at 14.1%
? Cross border shopping is also a problem due to our high tax regime
? A container of cigarettes sold at half retail price will yield &amp;pound;1.1m of profit
? Reports increasing of illegal whites now runs at 500 per annum 
? High month of July saw 97 reports 
? 'Tap House' outlets on housing estates are a major problem 
? When closed down legal shops turnover can go up by &amp;pound;1k per week!
? Illegal factory in Durham could produce 150 packs per minute
? Loos to revenue from this factory at full production equals &amp;pound;1m per day 
? Factory has stock of 89 million empty packets

Detective Superintendent Maria Woodall
? City of London Police deal with physical goods and streaming and every combination 
? Next year will be working with Banks to seize and close illegal accounts where fake goods are paid for 
? This is based on a Canadian initiative 
? Banks must cooperate as Visa and MasterCard drive enforcement 
? Massive issue is coming with all set top boxes capable of downloading leading to a major increase in streaming 

Discussion 
? Plain packaging can lead to more than 3% increase in counterfeiting 
? In Australia counterfeit packaging is often better quality than the genuine product
? Codentify is a new app to aid forensics and to act as a point of sale test
? Counterfeit cigarettes can be up to 400 times more dangerous than genuine 
? There is little or no legislation making it illegal to buy counterfeit products 
? A new law on goods in transit will be enacted next year which will make it harder to transport counterfeit materials</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cc2197629d05.81442534</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Undercover policing workshop (Warwick)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C22EB6FC-A8F0-470A-84A1-E8E05C33341E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Workshop on the ethics of undercover policing organised at Warwick, funded by the Department of Politics.

Dimensions of Serious Crime that Justify Preventive Measures

The research builds upon an intuitively plausible idea: the more serious and imminent crimes are, the more the prevention of these crimes is justifiable, if necessary by intrusive and coercive means. Intrusive and liberty-limiting preventive measures are not justified for all crimes, and in particular, are not justified for low-level, non-serious crimes.&amp;nbsp;This raises the question of what distinguishes serious from low-level crime.&amp;nbsp;We have found that there are deep complexities in addressing that question. We examine several of these complexities: 

a. The organisation of criminal activities makes the infliction of harm more frequent. Again a group's actions, if they reach a certain scale, pose a challenge to the state. General or organized commission of crime also undermines harm-reducing or welfare-increasing public institutions. Criminal gangs operate out of sight and in defiance of a jurisdiction and sometimes in competition with the authorities in a jurisdiction. This is not because they oppose all authority; on the contrary, they may be quite hierarchical themselves, or acknowledge a pecking order among fellow underground organizations. The point is that they are a locus of power and loyalty apart from overworld institutions, with secret plans and organization, and with a sense of money-making opportunities unconstrained by either conventional morality or law. They do not merely defy or ignore what the law prohibits, but recruit officials to see that the costs of defiance and disregard for the law in their case are minimized or eliminated. Further, they set themselves up as regulatory powers within illicit markets, discouraging new market entrants, intimidating unruly market participants, and acting violently against any would-be rival authorities. 
b. Crimes can be rendered more serious not by the direct harm that they cause, but by the harm they facilitate. Money laundering is one such case. Money-laundering facilitates the personal enjoyment of the proceeds of organized crime by criminals, and also the financing of a lot of crime, including the most serious crime, in the future. Knowingly making it easier&amp;nbsp;through money-laundering for a criminal gang with a long track record of brutality to extend that record, or to diversify their activities to include further offences that are mala in se, does seem, in its turn, wrong in itself, and therefore punishable in principle. Money-laundering typically finances not only more serious harm-an increase in the number of crimes of a given degree of harmfulness-but an apparatus designed to make harm-production efficient in the future. An apparatus that, so to speak,&amp;nbsp;industrializes crime -that makes the organization of crime more systematic&amp;nbsp;and more efficient-- is worse than arrangements&amp;nbsp;that simply facilitate more crime. The former involves specialization and co-ordination of many people's efforts. This is different from and morally worse than using the proceeds of one's own crimes to move from a part-time to a full time solo career in burglary. 
This line of thought runs contrary to claims made by prominent legal philosophers. Douglas Husak, an American legal philosopher who objects to heavy sentences for money laundering on moral grounds: according to him, depositing the proceeds of crime X does not add to the wrong of X itself, and only acts that reach the threshold for moral wrongness should be dealt with by hard treatment like imprisonment. His point is that imprisonment is out of order because punishment is out of order for something --an act of depositing money-- that is neither wrong in itself, nor necessarily bad in its effects. Such reasoning is faulty. 
c. Violations of privacy by agents other than governments are neglected in criteria of crime seriousness.&amp;nbsp;Although Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights recognizes natural persons as possible violators of privacy, nosey neighbours, voyeurs, or spouses concerned with infidelity lie well outside its main ambit. Its focus is on arbitrary official intrusion and disruption, disproportionate police surveillance, and disproportionate data retention by governments. Encroachments by the authorities on parental rights to determine the education and religion of their children and even the size of their families are also included. In all of these cases it is against the state that privacy needs defending. Non-state invasions of apolitical privacy- in the sense of invasions that are detached from the invaded person's playing of a citizenly role - are also important, as in stalking - and sometimes are more harmful than state surveillance.


2. The critique of preparatory offences

We defend some specific pieces of legislation that have been criticized for criminalizing preparatory acts. Thus we find that the approach to grooming in section 15 of the Sexual Offences Act in particular is justifiable. First, it effectively distinguishes between &amp;quot;contact&amp;quot; groomers and &amp;quot;fantasy&amp;quot; groomers, removing a basis for doubt about grooming offences on the possible remoteness of grooming behaviour from actual sexual contact. Second, it distinguishes between the sexualization of online behaviour between children and the informal profiling of likely targets by forensically aware adult paedophiles, who sometimes pose as sexualized children. 

We examine also the application of serious crime prevention orders under the Serious Crime Act 2007. Although the principle of these orders is justifiable, they allow preventive orders to be served on people convicted of relatively minor offences who do not belong to criminal gangs, and in contexts in which there are large minorities who break the law. In such cases the restriction of autonomy can be disproportionate. This calls for the fine-tuning of the legislation, since most of the offences that the legislation is applied to are serious and might in practice involve organised crime. 

In the case of counter-terrorism, on the other hand, the main moral difficulty lies elsewhere: rather than that of making appropriate allowances for large minorities who break the law, the problem is to capture in law the distinction between extremism in speech and violent extremism in deed. A lot of controversial preventive measures in counter-terrorism take the form of criminalizing approval for, assisting, or not informing on terrorists. For instance, non-violent extremism is targeted by the Prevent Duty Guidance for England and Wales March 2015, para.8. Non-violent extremism includes agitation against &amp;quot;British values,&amp;quot; such as tolerance and democracy. We find that criminalizing the expression of approval for terrorism is rights violating; recent laws call upon institutions to root out practices that are hard to distinguish from things those institutions have tolerated for a long time.

Further, we find general critiques of the &amp;quot;logic&amp;quot; of preventive justice or preparatory offences fall short of the mark. These include the following objections:

a. The autonomy objection holds that preventive police activity removes people's 'window of moral opportunity' to act in the right way. At best this will provide only one consideration amongst others, and will not rule out preventive measures entirely.
b. The personal criminal law objection complains that the existence of different laws for different people that civil preventive orders create is inconsistent with the value of equality before the law. This objection forgets that laws in general have differential effects upon citizens.
c. The due process for punishment objection argues that coercive preventive measures amount to a form of punishment that can be applied without the proper procedures such as trial, legal representation, and the possibility of appeal. This objection depends upon a common, but flawed, understanding of the basis for due process and criminal procedure. 

3. Intrusions and proportionality

The policing of organised crime and terrorism involves the infiltration of networks of people, and this typically requires the use of intrusive and manipulative methods such as the deployment of wiretaps, targeted surveillance, undercover officers, and informants. Other things being equal, it is more justifiable to use such methods to the extent that their expected costs (in the form of an invasion of privacy, and so forth) fall upon those whom there is reason to believe are involved in wrongdoing. We find that there is insufficient attention provided in the express wording of the law in this area to this idea, as expressed in the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (and also the current Investigatory Powers Bill). Although a distinction is made in the legal structure between effects upon those who are targets and those who are intruded upon collaterally, there is not sufficient direct recognition of the higher ethical bar for intrusion on those who are innocent or only at the fringes of an organised criminal group. Nonetheless, actual practice surrounding covert strategies may express sensitivity to the issue of innocence, even where the law does not.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In the course of our work we met with a number of researchers working in technology development and criminology, including the Centre for Secure Information Technologies (Queen's University Belfast), Shane Johnson (UCL), Chris Hankin (Imperial College London), Matt Jones (University of Swansea), Martin Innes, (Cardiff), Tao Chen (UCL). From these meetings we found:

? There is insufficient discussion and thought to the ethics of technology application as security technology projects proceed
? Privacy concerns relating to intrusive policing and intelligence are badly identified
? Predictive policing (which is not the same as preventive policing) work is not sufficiently attuned to issues of presumption of innocence or discriminatory profiling.
? The ethical concern over bulk collection of data by intelligence agencies will usefully be understood as involving freedom, and not just privacy.

We carried out the following impact-related activities:

? The commission of an ethics training video for use by undercover police in training
? Work on influence for the Government Office of Science
? A workshop on the ethics of undercover policing, attended by police representatives
? A series of meetings on counterfeiting, held in Parliament

Further use of findings would involve further formal ethics input into crime-related technology projects, training modules for police and security services, and reports for Government agencies on particular aspects of their work.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C81AB81B-9F94-43AB-B243-E2AA44554F80</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546381d94f01c8.11927373</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/pais/research/researchcentres/ierg/globaluncertainties/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Membership of Undercover Oversight Group, College of Policing</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>48A4E37A-FC13-49AC-91CC-F8DDA163ADD3</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54637dc42342e4.98677644</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>The Usual Suspects?
