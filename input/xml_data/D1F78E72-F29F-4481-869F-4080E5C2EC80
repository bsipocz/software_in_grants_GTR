It is often assumed that widening participation in higher education (HE), through various policies and initiatives, will equate to a fairer and more socially mobile society. Yet, while more disadvantaged groups are now progressing to HE, social mobility remains weak, suggesting that this is an over-simplified picture of the ways in which social inequalities are (re)produced in countries like the UK. The geographical (im)mobility of young people at this key transition point is rarely alluded to here, in terms of its significance in shaping social (im)mobility. In spatially diverse countries like the UK, access to universities, key labour markets, social networks, and other valuable resources often necessitate some degree of geographical mobility. In addressing social inequalities in wider society, it is therefore crucial to understand the nature of student flows across diverse parts of the UK, including the rationales different young people have for their (im)mobility to and from different places. There is already some evidence to suggest that the costs of HE study can deter the most disadvantaged young people from moving away for their studies, but what other place-based factors, including the cultural, social, and economic characteristics of localities might be important in shaping student (im)mobility? This interdisciplinary project will undertake an innovative and far-reaching programme of policy relevant research addressing the mobility patterns of UK HE students. The value of this research has been endorsed by all four UK HE Funding Councils, the UK Government's Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission (Chaired by Rt. Hon. Alan Milburn), The Sutton Trust, and Universities UK. These organisations are members of the project stakeholder group and will be closely involved in the research and dissemination programme, ensuring that the research addresses areas of policy relevance and reaches a wide audience. 

This novel research will uncover, for the first time, the nature of student flows within and across the four countries of the UK, together with rich and in-depth understandings about how they are shaped. Taking into account the socially, economically, politically and culturally diverse nature of UK society, the project will seek to understand the placed nature of educational decision making in particular. This unique work is interdisciplinary in nature, drawing on, and contributing to, the academic disciplines of geography, education, and sociology. The research is mixed methods and organised around two distinct but sequential phases, which include large scale quantitative analysis of UK-wide student records data (phase 1) that will frame the collection of new qualitative data (phase 2). Phase 1 will involve advanced spatial analysis to examine student flows at country, region, and locality levels, producing innovative graphics displaying these spatial movements in visual form. This analysis will explore patterns and relationships between student movements and social as well as spatial characteristics. In the second phase, qualitative research will take place in 10 purposefully selected case study schools across the UK, selected on the basis of criteria developed from the quantitative analysis. To explore the sorts of factors shaping young people's mobility patterns, data collection will involve interviews with young people, two members of their social network, as well as observation of their school contexts. These rich qualitative data will dig beneath the surface of the quantitative patterns, capturing how young people's subjective experiences of space and their own geographical imaginaries impact on their geographic (im)mobility. It will explore how these relationships to place and mobility intentions are constructed and influenced by their individual biographies, social network and school.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Non-academic beneficiaries of this project include:

POLICY-MAKERS

Findings from this research will be valuable to policy-makers across the UK as they seek to develop evidence-based solutions to addressing weak rates of social mobility. The project directly addresses key policy questions such as: should more local based HE provision be encouraged? Should funding and support mechanisms be put in place to encourage greater geographical movement of young people from disadvantaged backgrounds? Given that this project is UK-wide, it will also shed light on the impact on student mobility of distinctly different policy approaches across the four countries. It will offer insight into the impact of different changes to tuition fees across different parts of the UK, contributing in a timely way to current policy debates in this area. New evidence will be generated about the significance of student (im)mobility across different parts of the UK for young people from the most disadvantaged social backgrounds, enabling different Governments to develop and adapt policies in a more targeted way. 

The UK Government's Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission will be one of the key mechanisms used to disseminate the research to policy-makers. The work will also be presented at an ESRC seminar series which brings together policy-makers from across the UK, as well as being disseminated to key policy actors through policy briefings (see pathways to impact). 

CHARITIES AND 'THINK-TANKS' 

Charities and 'think-tanks' that are interested in social mobility, education and young people will benefit from gaining a greater understanding of the ways in which geographical mobility may be implicated in social mobility, as well as of the geographic mobility experiences of young people growing up in Britain today. This knowledge will help inform their own work programmes as well as the campaigning and lobbying work they engage in. The Sutton Trust is part of the stakeholder group, and findings will be disseminated to other similar organisations through policy briefs, blogging and the project's online/social media presence (see pathways to impact). 

HIGHER EDUCATION SECTOR ORGANISATIONS

Non-governmental bodies in the HE field will also be interested in the findings of this research, especially the four UK Funding Councils (that are all part of the project's stakeholder group), who are responsible for the provision, financing and regulating of HE across the UK. The findings will particularly benefit them in terms of understanding how to tackle barriers to HE in their particular contexts, including issues around the geographical provision of HE opportunities. 

UNIVERSITIES

Universities will also benefit from this research, especially given the increasing onus placed on them to widen the social characteristics of their intake, which necessitates a better understanding of the barriers to access for their particular institution. The findings from this research will help them to address this by uncovering how mobility and young people's geographical imaginaries might be implicated here. This is particularly pertinent for research-intensive HEIs, which tend to be the most socially exclusive institutions and are also unevenly spread across the UK. 

SCHOOLS AND CAREERS ADVISORY SERVICES

Schools and careers advisory services will benefit from an increased awareness and understanding of the needs of young people in terms of information, advice and guidance (IAG). They will also gain a greater understanding of the impact they can have on young people's HE transitions and life course.

YOUNG PEOPLE AND WIDER SOCIETY

Insights from this study will help to address inequalities in society and so benefit those from disadvantaged backgrounds. For example, the study will bring to the surface often over-looked and hidden barriers concerning the mobility patterns of different groups, located in different areas of the UK.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>224023</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Stakeholder Group Event (Central London)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>76C0563F-2358-40E8-A220-132F18CE976B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A stakeholder group has been established to inform the development of the research strategy and help disseminate outcomes, ensuring that the impact of the research is maximised. This group includes all four funding councils from each jurisdiction of the UK (Higher Education Funding Council for England, Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, Department for Economy Northern Ireland, and Scottish Funding Council), the Office for Fair Access, the Sutton Trust, Universities UK, Department for Education (UK Government Ministry), and the Higher Education Policy Institute. Each of these groups have a key influence on shaping policy and practice. In January 2017, the group was convened in central London for a meeting in order to receive their feedback on the overall project aims as well as some preliminary analysis of regional student im/mobility. The aim was to gather stakeholder perspectives on what they understand to be the key issues and their priorities for further research. The team was also able to discuss more specific collaborative work with stakeholder members including pieces of analyses and co-publication of research findings. The meeting increased several stakeholder group members' knowledge and understanding about geographies of higher education participation - including the existing evidence base and gaps in research. Future meetings will continue to inform stakeholders about the topic, as well as seeking feedback from group members to help shape the direction of the research to ensure that it is aligned with the needs of those in the policy and practice spheres.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6f5ba59e6e7.39604142</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Dialogue with Special Advisor to UK Government Secretary of State for the Environment</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>243FE43F-015D-4F77-B1FA-AF9B16D59948</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A special advisor for the Secretary of State for the Environment requested expertise on the geography of higher education participation to inform the development of the UK Government's social mobility strategy.
