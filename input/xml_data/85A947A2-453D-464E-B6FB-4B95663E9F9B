For this treatment to work, these modified cells will need to get to the bone marrow (where the leukaemia is found) and to survive over many months to prevent a relapse. Recently, it has been shown that some immune cells, called ?memory? cells are especially good at entering the bone marrow and surviving for long periods. 

Our project will investigate whether genetic alteration of these memory cells will generate cells with better anti-leukaemia effects. We will either purify memory cells that already have these characteristics before genetic alteration or we will modify the way we perform the genetic alteration so that we convert cells into ?memory-like? cells. 

To see if this will work, we perform experiments in which we will examine how good these modified cells are at getting to the bone marrow and how long they survive. If the results of these experiments are promising, we will hopefully be able to improve the way we perform this treatment in the future.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Successful T-cell immunotherapy for leukaemia requires trafficking of T cells to the bone marrow (BM) and their prolonged survival to prevent tumour recurrence. However, the phenotype of the T cell population best suited to meeting these dual objectives is not known.

The host institution is exploring the clinical strategy of adoptive transfer of autologous T cells transduced with T cell receptors (TCR) for leukaemia-associated antigens. In parallel, pre-clinical studies are aimed at defining the factors critical to the success or failure of such treatments. In this regard, the host laboratory has focussed its attention upon a leukaemia-associated antigen, MDM2. Recently, a retroviral construct containing and chains of a high affinity TCR for MDM2 has been generated and used successfully to transduce murine T cells. Incorporation of a c-myc tag into the TCR chain has enabled easy tracking of these cells in vivo.

Central memory T cells (TCM) are a subset of long-lived cells that re-circulate preferentially to the BM and thus, are attractive candidates for TCR transduction and adoptive therapy for leukaemias. In this proposal, I intend to examine the feasibility of generating TCR-transduced CD8 populations that re-capitulate the properties of TCM in vivo. 

I will first determine whether TCR transduction of CD8 cells with a TCM phenotype leads to enhanced BM homing and prolonged survival compared to conventionally activated/transduced T cells. In addition to evaluations of transduction efficiency and in vitro functions (cytokine generation, cytotoxicity), I will also determine BM homing in vivo by co-transfer of conventionally activated/transduced T cells (Thy1.1) or transduced, TCM phenotype cells (Thy1.2) to CD45.1 B6 mice. The relative survival of such cells long-term will also be examined. In parallel, short and long-term responsiveness to antigen will be tested in recipients given single transduced populations by ex vivo functional assays and by in vivo challenge with an MDM2-expressing leukaemia.

Using a similar approach, I will also consider whether IL-15 treatment of na&amp;iuml;ve CD8 T cells following activation and TCR transduction will generate cells with TCM properties that are maintained in vivo. Finally, by generating a modified retroviral construct, I will determine whether over-expression of the BM-homing molecule, CXCR4 will confer TCM-like properties to in TCR-transduced CD8 T cells following in vivo transfer. 

These data will provide important information in efforts to design the optimal strategy for TCR trasnduction for human cells and their potential application in phase I clinical studies.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>240585</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">G0802345</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>7C58A707-1BF6-4573-A44F-30B271C80813</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cancer</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>C6D70A71-8796-47BC-AFE0-CC2286E66A06</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Inflammatory and Immune System</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>DD81206B-5EB4-4BCC-AEF7-808A64606E0E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>5.2  Cellular and gene therapies</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
