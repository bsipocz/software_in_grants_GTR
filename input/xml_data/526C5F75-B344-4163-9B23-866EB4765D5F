One primary aim of the studentship will be to examine the extent to which an improved understanding of the natural changes in milk composition can be used to optimise and further refine the nutrient content of formula milk. This could then be used commercially in order to prevent excess fat deposition in early life. The composition of maternal milk is known to vary under a range of natural conditions through lactation. This includes both between and within mothers, over the course of lactation, during a single suckling episode and between litters. These changes occur because milk composition has evolved naturally to provide the best exclusive nourishment during the crucial period of early life. Therefore, changes in milk composition are likely to be largely driven by the differing metabolic demands of the offspring. At the same time milk composition is constrained by the mother's current diet and her overall nutritional state, with the two extreme ends of the dietary continuum namely, malnutrition and obesity, possibly compromising milk quality and healthy development of the offspring. However, the precise mutual dependency between maternal metabolism including milk production and metabolic needs of the infant are as yet unknown. The project will therefore establish for the first time the extent to which changes in milk composition through lactation may reflect the different metabolic demands of the offspring. This will be undertaken using the sheep which has the benefit (to the investigator) of being born with a mature hypothalamic-pituitary axis. Also following the loss of brown adipose tissue over the first week of life adipose tissue is the fastest growing tissue (or organ) in the body and thus has the potential to have a major impact on later risk of body composition. The experimental protocol will include serial samples of milk being taken from the mother together with blood samples from the offspring. These will then be subjected to metabolomic and transcriptomic profiling in order to establish correlations between milk composition and metabolic status of the offspring. In addition, adipose tissue will be sampled at defined stages of development to establish whether changes in milk composition through lactation impact on critical developmental features of adiposity e.g. increase in cell number or cell size, inflammatory response, leptin synthesis and mitochondrial biogenesis. This will be undertaken in a range of adipose tissue depots since it is hypothesised that these may be subject to very different endocrine and metabolic control systems. It is expected that the student will be able to undertake candidate gene expression analysis together with analysis of gene regulation cascades in a wide range of biological material taken from both ewes and lambs. This will enable a novel insight into the relationship between changes in maternal milk composition and adipose tissue growth together with the extent to which gene regulation responses during postnatal life can have short and long term health consequences through the life cycle. The study will be undertaken using an appropriate model of postnatal growth manipulation such as comparing twin and singleton offspring, for which we have established that singletons grow faster and deposit more fat. This is despite the fact that total milk yield is raised as ewes with twins make up for increased milk competition by producing more milk than ewes with singletons although milk quality is hypothesised to be different.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>91932</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/I016015/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
