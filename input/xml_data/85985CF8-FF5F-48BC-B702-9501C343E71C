The 2014 and 2016 surveys will be the 7th and 8th rounds in the series, following biennial surveys between 2002 and 2012.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This award covers the role of UK Co-ordinator and survey data collection for the 2014 and 2016 rounds of the ESS, which will be carried out by NatCen Social Research.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Co-ordinator role entails a wide range of responsibilities, which fall largely into three categories:&lt;/p>

&lt;ol>
 

 &lt;li>the provision of advice and guidance to the ESS Central Co-ordinating Team (CCT), and liaison between the ESS and the UK survey organisation&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>the supervision, documentation and conduct of the UK survey&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>the promotion of ESS within the UK.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>The surveys will take place in 2014 and 2016 . Each round will involve interviews with approx 2,300 people randomly selected across England, Scotland and Wales.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The primary beneficiaries of this project will be academics, both in Britain and internationally, with an interest in conducting cross-national research. The data collected as part of ESS will provide them with a unique resource (see section on Academic Beneficiaries and Case for Support for further details). 

Academics will readily be able to access the ESS via the ESS website. As in previous years, full documentation will be provided along with the data.

Our proposals include a wide range of dissemination activities to ensure that the ESS data collected are widely known about and used across a range of communities - including academics, government bodies, third sector organizations and journalists. These include:
 - Preparing briefing materials about ESS on NatCen's website and distributing email alerts to key groups (including government departments, academic list-servers, specific academic partners, and relevant third sector organisations. 
 - We would carry out at least two training events about ESS with ESDS over the lifetime of this grant.
 - Making contact with key third sector, government and academic institutions and individuals to promote the availability of Round 5 data. 
We would also work with NatCen's Communications and Impact team to focus on the non-academic impact of the ESS, concentrating particularly on: government departments; third sector organisations; and journalists. These are described in more detail in our Pathways to Impact plan. They include:
 - Providing visually engaging and easily sharable quarterly online content about key ESS findings on our website, promoted by NatCen's Communications Team.
 - Hosting an annual workshop or debate about ESS, focusing on non-academic users.
 - Committing to including ESS findings in NatCen's annual British Social Attitudes publication.
 - Amending NatCen's own ESS website to ensure that it provides clear and accessible content about the study (while not duplicating the effort that is going into the central ESS website. 

In all cases it would be important to discuss our strategy with the ESS CCT at City University in order to avoid any overlap or duplication of effort between our work and theirs.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1073910</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>What do British people really think about immigration?</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1AE5CAFE-1155-4A28-8E10-9BA73FC9C586</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A newsletter article and online blog reporting finsings to ESS questions on attitudes to immigration and the impacts of immigration.
