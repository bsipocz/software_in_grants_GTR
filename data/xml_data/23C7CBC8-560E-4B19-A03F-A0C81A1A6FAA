The Changing Face of Memorialisation</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/M008398/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>A considerable body of material continues to explore the changing face of death in the 21st century, amongst which is growing evidence of new and diverse forms of memorialisation as people mark the passing of those to whom they felt a close association in life - colleagues, friends and public figures as well as family members. This evidence, much of it anecdotal and in the popular media, raises new questions concerning the content, meanings and purposes of memorials and the process of memorialisation. As traditional forms are replaced or supplemented by personalised, customised responses, it appears that these lay bare the fundamental human urge to memorialise but with little to guide mourners, or those professionals and community representatives supporting them, in developing forms which will meet those deepest needs. This research will comprehensively analyse memorialisation practices in the UK, past and present, subjecting this to some international comparison, in order to inform understanding of: (i) the significance of memorials and memorialising processes today and throughout history and their relative significance at different points in time; (ii) the purposes and meanings which they fulfil today, the social effects observed in the past and the factors and contexts which shape these purposes, meanings and social effects; (iii) their forms and representations, past and present, and how and why these may be changing in contemporary society. Particular focus will be on: the role of religion; the context, understandings and practices of contemporary humanistic spiritualities; the significance of personal meaning-making; socio-economic and cultural variations and the development of cultural 'scripts'; the ways in which personal experiences and perspectives interface with social trends. We have identified 4 emergent tensions, about which we have currently little understanding nor have fashioned a response: tensions arising from an identity for the deceased which is contested between mourners; where the representation of the deceased and their life is shrouded in ambiguity; where forms which are permanent or forms which are transitory may variously be problematic; where there is conflict or dissonance between the public and private domains.
Using historical, ethnographic, visual and other qualitative methods, the project will undertake two surveys of literature, media and internet sources, one embedded historical case study, two free-standing strands, and four contemporary case studies. The surveys will separately and together draw up accounts of memorial practices in the distant and more recent past and the contemporary scene, seeking to understand the influences of the past on the present, the features of memorialisation which are enduring and those in which we are seeing rapid change. Analysis from the surveys will inform the conduct of the remainder of the study. The photographic strand will examine the significance of the photograph in mourning and remembering through history as well as contemporary proliferations through devices such as the mobile phone. The free-writing strand will examine the growing practice in hospices of encouraging free-writing from bereaved relatives, such as in creating 'bereavement trees' or communal memorial books, which serve as ever-growing memorials and the focus for both personal and shared mourning and remembering. The four case studies, exploring memorialisation in the military, among Polish migrants in Hull, the transgender population, and the hidden face of dementia, will further explicate the four tensions identified above. Each element of the study will report separately and produce a range of outputs for academic, professional and public audiences and be brought together in an overarching analysis culminating in the final report and an exhibition.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research will have impact on 3 broad groups of users in a variety of ways:

1. The academic community 
In addition to providing a hitherto unparalleled (breadth, depth and overall scope) study of memorialisation, the anticipated theoretical development arising from its innovative interdisciplinary approach and analytic frame, ensures that the project will make a significant contribution to the field of death studies and lay a foundation which other researchers may take forward in discrete areas and lines of enquiry. Further, the case studies will establish a data base in fields on which little is currently known - for example, memorialisation in the transgender community. Methodologically, the research will open up new ways of combining data; for example, the incorporation of visual evidence through the photographic essays alongside standard qualitative interviews offers exciting possibilities for triangulation and validation of qualitative findings. The comparative historical approach offers a grounding for contemporary studies which has so far been missing in commentaries of death in late modernity and postmodernist analyses; conversely, infusing historical enquiry with critical social theory (for example, the self and agency) suggests innovative ways of enhancing and enriching both history and social science.

2. The death services industry and its users
The research has the potential to have impact on the everyday practices of funeral directors and celebrants, morticians, stone masons and memorial services, health and social care practitioners/clinicians and policy makers (working in related fields such as with military personnel as well as in end of life/palliative care and bereavement services) coroners and the police. Its findings will add considerably to understanding of the issues which dying people and their relatives face in preparing for death and its aftermath. For example, it will illuminate the meanings which are attached to objects, embedded in identities, found in spiritual and religious resources and reflected in relationships, and the significance of these to health and wellbeing. It will also produce a range of tools which translate the implications of the findings into good working practices to support these front-line workers.

3. Museums and exhibitions community and its consumers
As well as staging its own exhibition(s) the research will offer a considerable resource for museums and the development of other exhibitions. Its integrated historical and contemporary focus speaks to the modern need to engage with the past in relation to ourselves and our own preoccupations. Presenting as it does a number of topical interests and social concerns - such as the integration and acculturation of migrant communities - the project will provide a range of accessible and engaging products of use to schools and other education communities.

Finally, memorialisation is a topic of increasing interest in popular culture and the discrete communities and particular issues which this research addresses are also increasingly aired in the public domain, hence the research has the potential for wide social impact. An important avenue for this will be through the project's culmination in 2017 providing the opportunity to showcase the research within and alongside the Hull City of Culture celebrations and events.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-06-15</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-11-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>669874</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Otago</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>New Zealand</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Art and Art History</gtr:department><gtr:description>Remember Me - Collaborating Institutions</gtr:description><gtr:id>7AC8A4CF-2C5D-4FBF-919A-815C221B76E4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The research collaboration is multi-disciplinary, including the disciplines of anthropology, applied social sciences, social work, sociology, political science, gender studies, archaeology, history, palliative and end of life care, religion and theology, pastoral care/theology, practical theology, photography, visual arts.

Dr Yvonne Inall presented research conducted with Professor Malcolm Lillie for the Remember Me study 'Deep in Time: Meaning and Mnemonic in Archaeological and Diaspora Studies of Death'. The conference was attended by an international audience from across a range of academic and practice disciplines, offering a unique opportunity to foster networks and future research collaborations. Dr Yvonne Inall also chaired one of the conference sessions.
Following on from this conference Dr Evans and Dr Inall have remained engaged with the Death and Culture 2016 network via social media. This has led to fruitful research discussions and the formulation of ongoing ties with the AHRC-funded project Continuing Bonds.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5891fbec7cad71.66322550</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.york.ac.uk/sociology/research/death-and-culture/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>'Remembering and Re-remembering Kith and Kin in Scottish Kirkyards', 'Scottish Migrant Headstones in Ceylon' at Commemorating Diasporic Death at Home and Abroad, National Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh, 25 of November.

The posters were prepared by Dr Mirka Hukelova with input from Dr Mik Drake and Emeritus Professor Margaret Holloway. A further two posters on the archaeology of martial death, burial and memorialisation in Iron Age and Roman Britain, and a case study of the medieval Battle of Towton were prepared by Dr Yvonne Inall with contributions from Malcolm Lillie, offering insights into the Remember Me study Deep in Time. 
The posters were displayed in the south transept of Beverley Minster from 11-13 November 2016. The display was then moved to St Mary's, Beverley, where it was on display from the afternoon of the 13th until the 22nd. The posters garnered real interest and photographs of members of the public viewing the posters were taken (with verbal permission) and posted on the Remember Me Twitter and Facebook feeds.
The display attracted media attention and Emeritus Professor Margaret Holloway was interviewed for BBC Radio Humberside's Sunday Morning programme, which was broadcast on 13 November 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>589097b1a43856.36546526</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Wordpress Blog: Remember Me: The Changing Face of Memorialisation.</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7B5A8D26-B070-4DC4-A2B9-358FE18C0513</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The blog is a public-facing interface for our researchers to engage with the general public.

The past concerns highlighted in this study reverberate through time and remain constant. The ongoing relationships between the living and the dead, between behaviours, places and the construction of memory continue in modern memorialisation strategies.

The distinguishing feature of contemporary memorialisation is its employment in personal meaning-making. While the need to find meaning in death is not a new phenomenon, it is the trend towards the creation of personal meaning rather than the taking of meaning from traditional and socially prescribed forms and practices which governs the shaping of memorialisation today.

Traditional forms of memorials continue to be chosen

Places and spaces are a recurrent theme, whether physical or virtual and imbued with emotional, social and spiritual significance.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We have early findings at this stage.
