More recently zeta functions have started to play a role also in group theory and representation theory. In these cases the zeta function encodes an infinite sequence of numbers a_1, a_2,..., where a_n is, for instance, the number of irreducible n-dimensional representations of a group. The zeta function defined using this sequence is called the representation zeta function of the group. Among other things, the zeta functions help us to say something about the growth rate of the sequence a_1, a_2,.... For large classes of interesting groups the precise rate of growth is governed by a rational number called the abscissa of convergence of the zeta function. 

The first part of this project will study the abscissa of convergence associated to the groups SL_N(o), that is, the group of N by N matrices with determinant 1 and with entries in a local principal ideal ring with finite residue field, such as the p-adic integers Z_p. The precise value of the abscissa of SL_N(o) is a mysterious object and there is currently not even a guess as to its precise value. We will develop and use several constructions for representations of the related group GL_N(o) of invertible matrices over o to pin down the value of the abscissa more precisely than has been done previously. A prominent role here is played by the so-called regular representations. 
The first goal is to find a precise conjectural value of the abscissa and to prove it for as many groups as possible. Since our methods work for all rings o, the second goal will be to address the problem of whether or not the abscissa of SL_N(o) is independent of o, where N and the residue field of o is fixed but o varies.

The second part of the project will generalise certain results from classical Deligne-Lusztig theory to the generalised unramified Deligne-Lusztig construction. These results will then be used to prove a generalisation of an asymptotic formula of Liebeck and Shalev for Chevalley groups over finite local rings G(o_r). There is some evidence that this formula can be viewed as a finite group analogue of some formulae for the abscissa of G(o), but the precise explanation for this is still not known, and our work aims to shed some light on this.
Finally, we aim to tie together the above topics by showing that the representations given by the generalised unramified Deligne-Lusztig construction for GL_n(o_r) are regular, and have therefore been included in the counting in the first part of the project.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>As for any project in the area of Pure Mathematics, the main beneficiaries of the proposed research are other mathematicians. However, generally speaking representation theory - even of finite groups, like in the present proposal - is an area which nowadays has many applications, ranging from crystals in chemistry and diffraction patterns in physics to wireless communication with multiple antennas. 
Moreover, some of the main techniques of this proposal (Deligne-Lusztig varieties and linear algebra over finite rings) can be used to construct efficient error-correcting codes. As information transmission becomes more and more advanced, linear groups over finite rings and their representations may very well find future applications in digital communication. 
The PI is actively seeking to find new applications of his work. He will engage with researchers in the area of algebraic geometric codes over finite rings to exchange ideas and explore the possibilities of cross-disciplinary research. A particularly interesting prospect is to what extent Deligne-Lusztig varieties over Artinian local rings (the main objects of the PI's expertise) can be used to construct new efficient codes. During the project the PI will seek to attend conferences and seminars on these topics, where appropriate.

Another potential way in which the proposed project may lead to impact is via its intradisciplinary character, bringing together group theory, number theory, representation theory and algebraic geometry. Despite their depth, many results in this area avoid becoming too dry and abstract and are understandable to beginning graduate students. In the long run, this can lead to the area growing rapidly in popularity which in turn may contribute to attracting the best international students to the UK, both for undergraduate and PhD studies. Since representation and subgroup growth has already become a recognisable and active area, and because of its unusually broad and strong UK basis, the area will also enhance the visibility of UK universities and mathematical research globally. 
 
Another major goal of this grant proposal is to fund a postdoctoral position. This will provide a unique opportunity for the PDRA to learn the novel developments and ideas outlined in the Case for Support, and to work in collaboration with some of the leading experts in the field. Such an experience will certainly be invaluable to the PDRA's career, and will help in establishing his/her as a member of the mathematical community.

Finally, this project will support the PI in establishing himself as a new member of the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Durham University, and as a researcher in the UK and internationally. The results of the proposed research will be published in academic journals of international standing. Prior to publication they will be made available on open-access repositories. The PDRA and the PI will present their work at conferences and seminars.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-01-12</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-13</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>94549</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Zeta functions play a major role in number theory, starting with the Riemann zeta function, and continuing with Dedekind zeta functions and more general Dirichlet series.

In this project I am working together with my PDRA Jokke H&amp;auml;s&amp;auml;. So far we have obtained the following results:

1. A refinement of a result of Liebeck and Shalev which says that the abscissa of convergence of a family of finite simple groups of Lie type is r/k where r is the rank and k is the number of positive roots. We have proved that the representations contributing to the abscissa are precisely the so-called regular representations. 

2. A new, generalised and simplified proof that the abscissa of convergence of a simple compact Lie group is r/k, where r is the rank and k is the number of positive roots. This was previously established by Larsen and Lubotzky, using a different argument. We prove a more general result in a more transparent way. As a consequence, we prove that also in this case the representations contributing to the abscissa are precisely the regular ones (i.e, corresponding to a regular weight).

3. We have proved that the group GL_N(o), where o is a compact discrete valuation ring, has finitely many twist-isoclasses of representations of each dimension. Moreover, we have proved that if the characteristic of o does not divide N, then the twist representation zeta function of GL_N(o) has the same abscissa of convergence as the representation zeta function of SL_N(o).

4. We have proved that the abscissae of the twist representation zeta functions of GL_2(o), for arbitrary o, is always 1.

All the above is being written up in a joint paper which will be completed in the next few months and will be submitted to a high standing international journal.

Another aspect of this project was a complete construction of all the regular representations of GL_n(o), joint with Shaun Stevens. This work was completed in Nov 2016 and has been submitted to a journal.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our results of finite groups of Lie type and Lie groups is currently the best explanation of why the abscissae are exactly r/k, but further work of experts in the field may eventually result in a full explanation.
Our results for GL_2(o) or SL_2(o) will be the first ones on the abscissae of convergence in the case where o has residue characteristic 2. Previous techniques were inadequate to deal with these cases. This opens up a host of new questions about representation zeta functions of SL_N(o) in &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; characteristic, that is, when the residue characteristic of o divides N, or when the characteristic of o itself divides N. These results are of interest in connection with the search for a generalisation of a result of Jaikin-Zapirain beyond compact p-adic analytic groups. The results are also closely connected with the work of Avni, Klopsch, Onn and Voll, and it is likely that our results will be of interest to these workers.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>FC118D4E-BD23-4EEF-90CB-D9C88FE18FAD</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5450bb52dc9862.38668296</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04796</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>198F3572-7716-433E-8894-564EEF2158E7</gtr:id><gtr:title>The regular representations of GLN over finite local principal ideal rings</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Bulletin of the London Mathematical Society</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/377bd6a05abda3217ec7bf0c726fda7f"><gtr:id>377bd6a05abda3217ec7bf0c726fda7f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Stasinski A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fe97fc73d91.22837387</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C7EE3246-68BA-40D9-B472-CFF6A6D2D1D0</gtr:id><gtr:title>The algebraisation of higher Deligne-Lusztig representations</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Selecta Mathematica</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/bbfbba64e0bed5a5bd0e165199be7334"><gtr:id>bbfbba64e0bed5a5bd0e165199be7334</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Chen Z</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5aa918a5989ce4.00453332</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/K024779/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>27F853CB-FB22-4B9D-82D7-542648D097F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Algebra &amp; Geometry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
