&lt;p>The study was originally run by the Department for Education (DfE) with annual interviews with young people and, for the first four waves, their parents between 2004 and 2010. Over 16,000 young people, born in 1989/1990, were tracked between the ages of 13/14 and 19/20. It is the only national longitudinal study focussing on young people?s transitions to adulthood and their pathways through the teenage years.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Following a consent-seeking exercise by the DfE, the cohort will be invited to take part in a 45-minute sequential mixed mode survey (involving web, telephone and face-to-face) in 2014/2015 when they will be aged 24/25. A wide range of data linkage consents will be collected, and linkage to administrative data on higher and further education will be carried out as part of this grant. The content of the survey will include education choices, employment, partnership, health, fertility and housing as well as income and finances.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Overall, the continuation of this cohort will provide multi-disciplinary longitudinal survey data, and linked administrative data, for a large-scale and nationally representative probability sample of young adults.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>There are three key groups who will benefit from the proposed study. First, as discussed in the section on academic beneficiaries, researchers from a wide range of disciplines will benefit from the unique resource represented by this detailed and innovative cohort study. Second, policy makers within government and international organisations, and third, ultimately the wider public, will benefit from the findings of the research. These latter groups are the focus here. 
The LSYPE cohort was originally designed to answer questions about the causal processes that lead to positive and negative educational outcomes for individuals. Developing a better understanding of these causal pathways can ultimately lead to greater effectiveness of schools and educational institutions more broadly in order to enhance the wellbeing of young people and maximise their opportunities and life chances. Our aim is to maintain the LSYPE cohort and link the existing datasets to administrative data on further and higher education, the labour market and state benefits, hospital episodes and records of offending. This will result in a research resource that can be used to understand more about the factors influencing individuals' experiences and choices as they make the transition into young adult life, and their outcomes at this age. 
Our longer-term aim is to maintain and enhance the first LSYPE cohort so that it provides a rich research resource documenting the lives and experiences of a large representative sample of those born in England in 1989/1990. As this cohort grows older the study will be able to provide evidence to inform a wide range of policy issues.
The link between IOE and the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), via Professor Dearden as Co-I, is particularly important for ensuring that the LSYPE ultimately has an impact on policies relating to individuals' experiences of higher education and transitions to young adult life. IFS has excellent links to key personnel in DfE, BIS and DWP which will help ensure both that the research agenda will be shaped by policy interests and that research findings are effectively disseminated and discussed with those most likely to find them of relevance.
Staff on the team at IOE has extensive experience of knowledge transfer with researchers and policy makers located in government departments and the devolved administrations. CLS already regularly produces high quality Briefing Papers for the policy-maker audience based on the results of the birth studies' data. A similar approach could be adopted with the LSYPE study in future if resources allow. Researchers from government departments, and organisations within the third sector, will be included in the consultation process to determine the exact content of any new LSYPE data collection sweeps, to ensure the relevance of the data collected.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>3869238</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Bullying experience and effects: UK evidence (public engagement event)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8F593F6D-B4EC-4AB4-99A6-3E2DA08327BE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In the lead-up to Anti-Bullying Week 2015, the Centre for Longitudinal Studies and the Anti-Bullying Alliance hosted campaigners, charities, local authorities and others to discuss the latest evidence on how bullying is affecting children and young people. This event was part of the ESRC Festival of Social Science, and was hosted by Barclays at their creative space in east London. It was hosted by CLS in collaboration with the Anti-Bullying Alliance.

Speakers included Dr Stella Chatzitheochari, University of Warwick (presented research on bullying among children with disabilities); Dr Morag Henderson, CLS (presented research on bullying among sexual minorities); Prof Louise Arseneault, King's College London (presented on the long-term effects of childhood bullying on adult physical and mental health); Kiri Joliffe, Young NCB representative (presented a first-hand account of her experiences being bullied at school); Anna Feuchtwang, Anti-Bullying Alliance (chair).

There were just under 140 delegates in attendance: 42 members of the third sector, 28 members of the public sector, 38 academics, 21 members of the general public, and 9 others.

Following the presentations from academics, the panel (including a young person and members of the Anti-Bullying Alliance team), engaged in a discussion with the audience.

Delegates gave this event an average of 8/10 on satisfaction, and a 8.5/10 on relevance.

Following the event, a PGCE Programme Leader from the UCL Institute of Education requested more information on the research to inform teacher training on equality and diversity.

CLS also had requests for further information from Buckinghamshire County Council, The Theatre Centre (empowering young leadership and youth activism through the arts), and members of the public.


Following the event, the Founder and President of Red Balloon Learner Centres asked to collaborate on future bullying work.

Following the event, a delegate from Buckinghamshire County Council requested 100 copies of all event materials to distribute to delegates at the Council's upcoming E-Safety Conference for students and professionals working with children and young people.

There was considerable discussion afterwards and from this we started to form a research group on the topic of Subject Choice bringing together international researchers who are working in this field. 

The abstract follows: 

In this paper we identify patterns of subject and qualification choices made at age 14. Most past research on 'subject choice' has focused on the later stages of educational trajectories, particularly Higher Education. However, the choices made at early branching points can limit pupils' subsequent options, potentially contributing to educational inequalities. This paper identifies the patterns of General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) subjects chosen by a cohort of young people born in 1989/1990. We make use of the Next Steps data (formerly the Longitudinal Study of Young People in England (LSYPE)) which is linked to the National Pupil Database. We develop an approach to measuring the academic selectivity of subjects and qualifications. We examine the roles of social class, parental education, income, gender and ethnicity in determining participation in these curriculum groupings. We also examine the role of the intersections of these variables, for example, the different role of gender for working and middle class youth. Using measures of prior attainment measured at age thirteen, we address the question of whether curriculum differentials simply reflect differences in prior attainment or whether they actually exacerbate inequalities.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56bdd22a3a7818.92870320</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.slls.org.uk/#!call-for-papers/c11p2</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Meetings with survey agencies regarding strategic issues and data collection innovations</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>57A1A6F7-9008-467D-AF78-48F67D2D09E7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We wrote to all of the main UK survey agencies - Ipsos MORI, NatCen, TNS-BMRB, Gfk-NOP, ONS - to ask them to showcase to us some of the innovations in data collection and new technologies that they may have carried out on commercial and other kinds of studies, and also to invite them to discuss with us strategic issues facing longitudinal studies in the UK.

It is a large conference lasting 5 days with multiple strands parallel sessions at each time, attended by around 800 academics, professional survey practitioners and post-graduate students from around the world. 

This is one of the major international survey methodology conferences, which takes place biennially. It was attended by eight members of CLS staff. In total, we delivered and/or co-authored eleven presentations based on the three of our four cohort studies, covering surveying children and young people, collection of time-use and activity monitor data, data linkage, mixed-modes, event history calendars, para-data, DDI and interviewer training. Many of the presentations were joint with the survey agencies we have worked with on the studies (NatCen, IPSOS-MORI and TNS-BMRB). We are also organised seven conference sessions in total on surveying children and young people, collecting time-use data and administrative data linkage. 

Our presence at ESRA was backed up by a London-based social media strategy which involved tweets from the @clscohorts account to promote the presentations on the cohort studies and the sessions we organised. Two of the staff members also engaged in tweeting at the conference. It total we sent around 150 tweets making us among the top tweeters at the whole conference.
