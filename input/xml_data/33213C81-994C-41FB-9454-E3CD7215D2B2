&lt;p>The research will establish whether or not there is an age-related propensity to confuse temporary associations in memory, and will investigate the processes that may lead to such binding decrements. In everyday life, an age-related binding deficit might be manifest in a number of ways, such as in an increased likelihood with age to confuse the names and faces of people to whom one has just been introduced, or to forget whether the white round pill or the yellow oval pill had just been taken. Three experiments will address whether or not:&lt;/p>

 &lt;li>the presentation time of to-be-remembered items influences binding efficacy in older adults&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>older adults exhibit the same serial position effects, or ?overwriting? of bound representations in memory that has previously been observed in young adults&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>older adults are less able than young adults to inhibit irrelevant items from working memory. &lt;/li>

&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>Together, these experiments will provide insight into the cognitive abilities that are preserved or impaired with the ageing process.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>76482</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Exhibition (Edinburgh Science Festival, 2012)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>02745DBD-7ADA-498C-ADA3-1930B1825DFD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>To support this dissemination, visitors to the stall were invited to carry out working memory tasks on a laptop PC, which helped to demonstrate the concepts we were discussing.

There were four academic speakers, including the current PI (Dr Brown), and the topics included healthy cognitive ageing, dementia, cognition in Parkinson's disease, and older adults' use of digital technologies. Seventy people from across the various sectors attended the event, and we had a special guest speaker, Mr Brian Sloan, CEO of Age Scotland, who spoke about loneliness and isolation in older age. The event was a great success and this is evidenced by the evaluations we received afterwards (e.g. 'All topics were very interesting and informative', 'These are important topics today and of much relevance to the older person...Strathclyde's research function will greatly assist in disseminating the facts to appropriate parties'). The event also resulted in new collaborations for my research group - we are currently partnering with one of the charities that attended the event, Generations Working Together, to explore the outcomes of intergenerational engagement in older age.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ab0fc6b04513.40475915</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Third sector organisations</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Academic seminar (University of Missouri-Columbia, November 2015)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>130E72B9-8FD0-44D5-8585-3AE7F72A47FC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Approximately 20 academic staff, postgraduate students, and undergraduate students at the University of Missouri-Columbia engaged with the research topic and findings.

The aim was to improve the understanding of the general public regarding cognitive ageing and how memory operates.

The conference resulted in the development of a collaboration between myself and another academic interested in cognitive ageing (Dr Carol Holland, Aston University). The audience also reported an increased engagement with, and understanding of, the topic. Feedback received after the conference included: &amp;quot;many thanks for a most interesting and informative day&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;The day was interesting, informative and very enjoyable&amp;quot;; and &amp;quot;What a brilliant team of speakers you assembled&amp;quot;.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>546357d855ff67.21596672</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Academic seminar (Liverpool John Moores University, 2012)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>78B2B42F-B09C-4BB1-9046-308216AB5548</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Seminar given to approximately 20 academics at the Psychology department at Liverpool John Moores University.

We focused upon a form of memory that is sensitive to the ageing process - visual short-term ('working') memory, and aimed to establish the ability of healthy older adults to create and maintain the associations (bindings) between visual features (colours and shapes). An important area of debate exists regarding whether or not temporary memory for associated visual information is more age-sensitive than is memory for individual features. Another aim was to determine the potential role of encoding processes in any binding deficits observed, and on working memory performance more generally. As a result of this project, our empirical and theoretical understanding of binding in visual working memory has advanced. Previously, there has been relatively little research focusing specifically on temporary binding of visual material, and much less research that has investigated performance in older as well as younger adults. The research has therefore contributed necessary empirical data to this area of study. Theoretically, as a result of the grant, we now have a greater understanding of temporary visual feature binding and the effects of ageing on the processes involved in this ability. We now know that, when considering the temporary binding of surface visual features (colour and shape), supporting previous conclusions in the literature, healthy older adults are generally able to create and maintain bindings. Although deficits have occasionally been observed, they have been small and unreliable, relative to those reported in the literature on long-term memory and on pathological ageing (particularly Alzheimer's disease). Finally, the research demonstrated theoretically interesting limitations regarding how older adults encode information in visual working memory, which may indicate deficits in attentional and/or storage capacity.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The scientific findings and outputs have impacted upon, and will continue to impact upon, national and international academics in psychology, especially those who focus upon the study of cognitive psychology, of cognitive ageing, and of Alzheimer's disease. However, the research is also relevant to those interested in the basic study of visual working memory, attention, and binding, as well as those broadly interested in the study of cognitive ageing (thereby not limiting the audience to psychologists). Finally, the findings are relevant to clinicians and other healthcare providers, as the identification of a cognitive ability (temporary binding of colour and shape) that is insensitive to the effects of healthy ageing, allows for future development of tests of temporary binding that have been shown to be sensitive to neurodegenerative disease, notably Alzheimer's disease.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>195C31FA-6CC2-4F81-AD27-C709940BA10C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546361b9986bc7.88280724</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Healthcare,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.esrc.ac.uk/my-esrc/grants/RES-000-22-4661/read/reports</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AB27FA95-ADA5-4E21-BB02-EC2E484E7834</gtr:id><gtr:title>Visual feature binding in younger and older adults: encoding and suffix interference effects.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Memory (Hove, England)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/88a9f182b23cf87ca9c242c7d4cf809b"><gtr:id>88a9f182b23cf87ca9c242c7d4cf809b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Brown LA</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0965-8211</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58ab0a6032c8a6.63231768</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5BE1893F-43C0-4FDA-80D7-D25D4EB29D57</gtr:id><gtr:title>Working Memory and Ageing</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8c2d22caef0522e3dcdb6b3c26e88e8c"><gtr:id>8c2d22caef0522e3dcdb6b3c26e88e8c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Logie RH Morris R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1848721265</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>54624fe7552f66.33888986</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>57D6696A-9B82-4A78-B278-4802E9946EB1</gtr:id><gtr:title>Working Memory: Developmental Differences, Component Processes and Improvement Mechanisms</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d077a93e49d3d30fcab79c341a7407c8"><gtr:id>d077a93e49d3d30fcab79c341a7407c8</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Allen RJ Brown LA Niven EH</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781626189270</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>r_381165188891e0ad18</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/J002712/1</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-000-22-4661</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
