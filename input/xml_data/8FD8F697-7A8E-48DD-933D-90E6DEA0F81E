All are topical research areas in experimental economics with clear real- world applications.

Who will benefit from this research? 

- Final users (i.e. Government, Regulators) and researchers from consumer groups, charities, NGOs and managers in the commercial and financial sectors. 
- Our workshop aims to bring the final user closer to the research world, while highlighting recent advances in experimental economic methodology and its real-world applications. 

How will they benefit from this research? 

Topic One
- Employers have recently invested in tools where they can monitor worker activity on the internet. 
- These costs are a substantial drain on firm efficiency. Hence the more direct benefit of this line of research will be to firms.

Topic Two 
- Collusion is a perennial problem in markets
- Regulators are increasingly looking for ways to understand why and how it occurs. 
- What types of policies will deter them from forming. 
- Regulators will be the final users of this topic.

Topic Three
- Understanding social preferences is important in understanding altruism, and creating strong institutions (legal, social, health and educational) as well as the voluntary sector (charities, NGOs etc)
- The application of this research field is huge: from childhood obesity to discrimination, social integration (vs. isolation) and other related topic. 
- Potential users of this topic: National Council for Voluntary Organisations, Department for Education (UK Government), NGOs and INGOs.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-02-09</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-02-10</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>29823</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>London PhD Experimental Workshop (LPEx) 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B7464FC0-BD6A-4DBB-BDA4-2C6FE7CC2B33</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The London PhD Experimental Economics Workshop is a one day workshop that aims to provide a forum for doctoral students and young researchers in the field of experimental economics to get in touch with each other, present their work and receive feedback from more experienced members of the community.

The workshops address three areas that have important economic and efficiency consequences. The areas chosen for the LEW are important in understanding the institutions and firms in the society.

First, Labour markets and virtual organization is about workers, organization of teams, incentives, etc. For example, a key concern for many organizations in recent years has been productivity losses due to internet use at the workplace. 

Our second topic, Collusion, addresses a perennial problem in markets where regulators could benefit from a better understanding of why and how it occurs. 

Lastly, the third topic The Emergence of Social Preferences sheds light on important social phenomenon such as charity and the institutions that we adopt in our society. 

The LEW2014 edition was organized in 4 days. The three workshops were organized together around an unique conference to maximize visibility. The first day we had the inaugural conference, by Prof. Rosemarie Nagel, Pompeu Fabra University, 'The Economic Engineer arrives to the keynesian Beauty Contest Game'. This was followed by the workshop on the 2nd, 3rd and 4th days. In every workshop we had three guest speakers. All the invited speakers have made significant contributions in understanding the main areas of the workshop.

The plenary sessions were interspersed with regular presentations made up of submitted papers. Note that young researchers from the UK were encouraged to submit their research and attend the conference. The sessions were organized around specific topics (for example Cooperation, trust and equality, Honesty, etc. ).

Behavioural and Experimental Economics are becoming major fields in Economics. Behavioural economics experiments are gaining visibility and traction not only in academic research but also among public decision-makers and private practitioners.

This grant has generated a number of outcomes

1. Put London as a central place in BehEco in Europe.

2. Facilitated the creation of the The London Behavioral and Experimental Group (LBEG), a network of behavioural and experimental economists based in the London universities

3. Has launched the London PhD Experimental workshop (LPEx). The LPEx has become in core place for interaction and spread of ideas for PhD students in the field.

All in all, the LEW has launched a series of innovative knowledge exchange activities during 3 years (2014, 2015 and 2016), including: Conferences, Seminars, Book Presentations, Academics-Practitioners Workshops, PhD Students Meetings, and similar.

Venues and initiatives will be spread across the various London universities, including: London School of Economics, Middlesex University London, University College London, Royal Holloway University London.

It has been a huge success.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Before this workshop, academics did not know professionals working in closed fields (idem in the other way around). These conversations have already bridged these two (until then) separated worlds. In the following years we will see joint projects and efforts that were started precisely because this workshop.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>87BE2614-BCAC-49D6-AFB5-5A2F8A1015C1</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5460a37158a0c5.20230652</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Education,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Retail,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://sites.google.com/site/pablobranasgarza/lew</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>&amp;quot;Academics and professionals designing better policies&amp;quot;</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>44D4FB6D-B6E1-47CE-9D02-A664D59E9CA6</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5653269c390523.64492008</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://leweek.co.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/L001071/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>19539613-8143-4CD6-B1E5-0C7B93D08B7D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Behavioural &amp; experimental eco</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
