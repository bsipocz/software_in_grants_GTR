and P2X7</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>BB/F001320/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Improving therapeutic strategies for the treatment of pain and chronic inflammation requires an understanding of the chemical mediators and receptors that are involved in these processes. Only then can new, selective drugs be developed. One of these chemicals is ATP, present in all cells and released into the external environment whenever there is tissue damage or inflammation. The sensors for extracellular ATP on the surface of cells are the purinergic receptors. Two members of this family that are expressed in immune cells and have been shown to be involved in pain pathology are P2X4 and P2X7. They have a trimeric structure and form ion channels that allow cations to move into and out of the cell. These two receptors have many different functional properties, not least their sensitivity to ATP; P2X4 is activated by much lower ATP levels than is required to activate P2X7 receptors. In addition, we have recently shown that these two receptors can also associate with each other to form mixed, heteromeric, receptors with properties that distinguish them from either parent type. This diversity of receptors increases the complexity of ATP signalling. Our aim is to determine the subunit composition of these receptors to reveal the structural diversity of receptors expressed, and to understand what role these different receptors play in transmitting the ATP signals in immune cells.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>ATP acting via P2X purinergic receptors has many effects on macrophages and microglia. It evokes inward currents, an increase in intracellular calcium, activation of mitogen activated protein kinase, cytokine release and cell death. The predominant P2X receptor subtypes expressed are P2X4 and P2X7, and both of these have been shown to play a key role in neuropathic pain. To develop therapeutic strategies for the treatment of pain we need to understand which receptors transmit the ATP signal. The P2X4 and P2X7 subtypes can function as homomers and their properties differ from each other in many key respects. Diversity is increased further by their ability to form heteromeric complexes. We have recently obtained persuasive evidence for the formation of P2X4/7 heteromers with properties distinguishable from the parent homomers. In addition P2X7 has recently been shown to form a signalling complex with the hemichannel pannexin-1. Our aims are to define the subunit identity of the physiological receptors and elucidate mechanisms for how P2X4 and P2X7 regulate the cellular response to ATP. Our specific aims are as follows: 1. To use atomic force microscopy to visualize the composition of receptors complexes formed by recombinant P2X4 and P2X7 and to determine the stoichiometry of the interaction with pannexin-1. 2. To characterize the electrophysiological and pharmacological properties of the recombinant P2X4/7 receptors. We will use mutant subunit, which function as heteromers but not homomers, to isolate the heteromeric component of the whole current. 3. To analyse P2X receptor currents in primary microglia and macrophages and identify a component with properties resembling the heteromers, and to look at the effects of knocking down P2X4 expression on these currents. 4. To compare the coupling of heteromeric and homomeric P2X4/7 receptors to downstream effectors using fluorescence based assays and confocal microscopy.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>319872</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Max Planck Society</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Max Planck Institute for Brain Research</gtr:department><gtr:description>Analysis of expression of alternatively spliced transcripts of the P2X7 receptor</gtr:description><gtr:id>EE23A085-5D18-403E-8B01-4420899BFB2C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The publication Nicke et al (2009) that is listed.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54635558943006.93841120-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Identification of an alternatively spliced variant of the P2X7 receptor transcript that encoded a channel with an altered N-terminus that escaped inactivation in one of the commercially available strain of P2X7 knock out mice.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We identified protein expression of a variant of the P2X7 receptor in certain tissues of mouse in which the receptor was thought to have been genetically deleted.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2008-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Portsmouth</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>This collaboration provided tissue from two strains of P2X7 knock-out mice and carried out some RT-PCR reactions to identify alternatively spliced variants of the P2X7 receptor transcript.</gtr:description><gtr:id>AC088385-CF40-4966-AB18-4CF492ED6C77</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b961a454b961a468-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>During the course of the project we embarked upon a collaboration with School of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, University of Portsmouth, to provide us with two strains of the P2X7 knock-down mice, and to carry out an analysis of P2X7 transcripts in wild type and knock-down strains.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2008-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Cambridge</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Imaging P2X4-7 complexes by atomic force microscopy</gtr:description><gtr:id>3120EBE2-DDEA-4BC8-A11F-40F5F7ABF0CD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The paper Antonio et al.

There has been considerable interest from pharmaceutical companies in developing new therapeutics targeting the P2X4 and P2X7 receptors and therefore our work highlighting differences in the structure and function of the human and mouse isoforms of the receptor is crucially important because the actions of these novel compounds are first tested in mice. Also our work highlighted that one of the two commonly used strain of mice in which P2X7 was deleted, was not a good knock-out model because other active variants of the receptors were still expressed. This has influenced the utilization of this particular strain of mice and the interpretations of results that have been obtained using it.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2009</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>E6F2A000-D858-41B4-9C0D-72BB063E1BFF</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>54637ff159db54.67193319</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Our research has focused on a family of receptors (P2X) that recognize the signaling molecule ATP and mediate its effects in the immune and nervous systems. These receptors are up-regulated in disease and play an important role in inflammation. The academic community and pharmaceutical industry are very interested in developing novel drugs that target these receptors to treat chronic inflammatory diseases such as arthritis, pain and also cancer. We have identified novel mechanisms that are important for controlling the functional properties of these receptors and in particular P2X4 and P2X7. One example is cholesterol - we have shown that cholesterol strongly inhibits the activity of the P2X7 receptor which suggests that changes in cholesterol that take place where there is inflammation, might be associated with up-regulating receptor activity. The identification of cholesterol as an important regulator of receptor activity will hopefully open up new avenues for the development of therapeutics. We have also identified variants of the receptor and characterized them in order to understand how they behave differently from the original forms of the receptors and in what tissues they are expressed. This work has been carried out on the mouse receptors. Much of our understanding of the role of P2X receptors in health and disease is based upon work carried out on mice, both wild type and those which have the receptors genetically deleted; so-called knock out mice. We have compared different knock-outs and shown that some are not true knock-outs but continue to express variants of the receptor. Our work has contributed to an understanding of the structure and function of these two important P2X receptors - P2X4 and P2X7, and will aid in their development as novel drug targets.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>There is considerable interest in developing therapeutics that target this receptor for treatment of inflammatory conditions and cancer. Our research has improved our understanding of the structure and function of P2X4 and P2X7 receptors and of the important differences that exist between the properties of the mouse and human receptors, which is of crucial importance if we are to utilize mice to investigate the role of these receptors in health and disease and to test new drugs. We have also identified one of the commonly used strain of mice that was thought to have P2X7 genetically deleted, as not being a true knock-out because of expression of different variants of the receptor. It is important that scientists working with these mice understand how expression has been altered in the different tissues.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>BFCEAE3C-4E10-493F-992E-9473D51FB940</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546376be7da154.76231678</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Pharmaceuticals and Medical
