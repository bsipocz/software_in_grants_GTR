However, the complexity of modern HPC hardware means that scientific software development now requires teams of scientists and programmers to work together, with different and non-overlapping skill-sets required from each member of the group. This complexity can lead to software development projects stalling. Investments in software development are in danger of being lost, either because key members of a team move on, or because a lack of planning or engagement means that a sustainable user and developer community has failed to gel around a particular code.

Research Software Engineers (RSEs) can solve this problem. RSEs have the skills and training necessary to support software development projects as they move through different stages of the academic software lifecycle. Academic software evolves along this lifecycle, from being a code used by an initial team of researchers, through to a large multi-site community code used by academics and industrialists from across the UK and around the World. RSEs provide the training and support needed to help academic software developers structure their projects to support the sustainable growth of their user and developer communities. RSEs are also highly skilled programmers who can train software developers in advanced HPC techniques, and who can support developers in the implementation, optimisation and testing of complex and intricate code. Together with academic software developers, RSEs can support UK investment in HPC, and ensure that the potential of computational science and engineering to revolutionise the design of future products and industrial processes is realised.

This project aims to develop sustainable RSE career pathways and funding at Bristol. This will support the growth of a sustainable team of RSEs at the University. Software development projects that will be supported include; the building of code to interface real biological cells with virtual simulated cells, so to support the rapid design of new biomanufacturing control processes; the development of code to more quickly model the behaviour of electrons in novel materials, to support the design of new fuel cells and batteries; code to improve our understanding of glass-like matter, so to help design new materials with exciting new properties; software to support modelling of the quantum interaction between laser light and microscopic nanoparticles, to support the design of optical tweezers and new optically driven nanomachines; and code to design new medicinal drugs and to understand why existing treatments are no longer working, thereby supporting the development of 21st century medicine.

Finally, this project aims to create a coherent set of teaching materials in programming and research software engineering. These, together with the development of software to support science and programming lessons held in an interactive 3D planetarium, will help inspire and educate the next generation of scientists and RSEs. These materials will showcase how maths, physics, computing and chemistry can be used in the &amp;quot;real world&amp;quot; to create the high-tech tools and industries of the future.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The establishment of a sustainable career pathway, funding, and training of Research Software Engineers (RSEs) will directly impact all UK academics and industrialists whose research depends on the development of UK scientific code. The impact, sustainability and international reputation of UK academic software will be significantly enhanced by the sustainable growth of RSE teams, and a change in academic and funder culture to trust and support RSE involvement in academic software projects. This will maximise return on investment by the EPSRC in HPC and software development, and will multiply its impact by ensuring that outputs can be sustainably developed beyond the funded lifetimes of their projects. RSEs will help maximise this impact by embedding best practice in programming and sustainability into software development projects, and will support academic developers in creating robust, reusable, reliable, documented and fully-tested components that can be trusted and built-upon by future researchers.

This Fellowship will directly support the development of a sustainable RSE career pathway, and growth of an RSE team at Bristol. Significant impact will come from the large pool of researchers and RSEs who will benefit directly from the training and career development that will be provided. By working with and providing training that can be used by the CDTs, CCPs and Software Carpentry, I will help raise the knowledge-base of the UK software development community. The availability of a pool of trained and capable software developers and RSEs will encourage investment in software projects in the UK, consolidating the reputation of UK software on the international stage. This will directly benefit UK industry and academia, by supplying a steady flow of talented individuals with the programming, scientific and mathematical skills necessary to help the UK maintain its lead in the knowledge economy.

The scientific outputs supported by this Fellowship will have impact across a range of disciplines and industries. Software to be supported will have impact in areas such as biomanufacturing, catalyst design, novel materials, 21st century medicine and quantum technologies. The timescale for these impacts will depend on the progress of each piece of software along the academic software lifecycle. RSE support that understands this lifecycle can accelerate progress. This will ensure that the UK maintains its leading position in international research excellence, and has the software tools and trained personnel to encourage investment in future industry. Through collaboration with Cresset, a UK SME, I will develop pathways for rapid commercialisation of academic software, and a means by which academic software developers and RSEs can provide scientific consultancy. This will further enhance industrial impact, and provide a route by which EPSRC investment in software can show a demonstrable return to the UK economy.

Finally, I want to have impact by raising the public and academic profile of scientific software developers and RSEs. Through advertising successes of RSE projects at conferences, by providing publicly accessible training materials, and by creating interactive school science lessons in a 3D planetarium, this Fellowship aims to enthuse and inspire the next generation of students, scientists and software developers. I want to raise the profile of programming, physics, maths and chemistry, and show how they have real-world applications to help develop future technologies. I want to positively impact the career choices of students and young scientists by showing them that there is stable career pathway for scientific software developers and RSEs, that this is an exciting and dynamic career choice, it does let you work with intelligent and energetic people, it can allow you to travel around the World, and most importantly, it puts you in a position to shape how the technology of the future will be designed and developed.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-07-03</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-07-04</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>488452</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>First Conference of Research Software Engineers</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>591EEE0F-C6CA-4A7A-9D78-455F22A8D22E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I was on the organising committee (workshop chair and website manager) for the first conference of research software engineers (RSEs). The purpose was to bring together RSEs, funders, sponsors and other stakeholders to discuss issues around research software, participate in talks and hands-on training workshops. 202 people from 14 different countries attended over two days at the Manchester Museum of Science and Industry. Response from the feedback survey showed that 95% of responders would come again to the conference, and it scored 4.3 out of 5. The majority of the attendees came from a background in Physical Sciences (30%), Computer Sciences (18%) and Biological Sciences (17%). The conference sparked discussions and shared knowledge. As a direct result, a UKRSE Slack channel was set up which has over 250 active members, and a second conference (which I will chair) is being arranged for September 2017.

Version 2016.X includes metrics collection code that shows that the 2016.X releases have been used over 70,000 times across 7 countries (including over 60 times in the US, ~250 times in Canada, and ~1500 times in Spain). Sire 2016.3.1 is being commercialised via a new collaboration with Cresset, with the waterswap tool being built into the new product &amp;quot;flare&amp;quot; (which is currently in beta release, and will be marketed at the 2017 Spring ACS Meeting in San Francisco. The software provides the foundation of the successful CCP-Biosim Software Flagship application to the EPSRC, and will form the basis of BioSimSpace, which will provide an underlying platform to support national and international collaborative biomolecular simulation software development and application.

provided a much cleaner user interface, which encouraged uptake. It provided the proof-of-concept implementation of the LigandSwap method, which was refined and given a simple user interface such that it is now in use (papers describing this method are in production). Researchers at the University of Edinburgh have combined this software with the OpenMM dynamics software from the Pande group (Stanford) to give a GPU-accelerated MD capability. The software has been picked up by a pharmaceutical software company (Cresset), who are now working with me to create commercial software based on top of Sire. The software forms the basis of several derived software development projects (e.g. FESetup, Nautilus, Waterswap, Ligandswap) and also provides the foundation layer for the software projects described in my EPSRC RSE Fellowship. This software is the foundation for continued development (Sire 2016.X), and is now being used as the foundation of software to model the growth of bacterial cell colonies.
