into improvements in clinical practice is essential to ensure the continued delivery of UK economic and
health benefits, however this process is limited at the Universities of Birmingham and Warwick by a
number of factors, including (in no particular order):
Current low levels of business-knowledge base collaboration. There is a clear need to encourage
greater interaction with industry, as the West Midlands currently has lower levels of private sector
investment in R&amp;amp;D than any other English Region 1. Businesses recognise the value of working with
Universities, however there can be confusion about how and where to locate the required expertise.
There is the need for more efficient knowledge transfer mechanisms between the knowledge base and
industry.
Absence of pre-incubator (hatchery) facilities to support early stage spin-out companies: The
early stage of a spin-out venture is extremely risky and facilities are required to nurture these activities
and allow proof of concept to be demonstrated, prior to taking space in a science park.
Loss of research staff from the Region: The Region has world-class strengths in biomedical
research (with a highly successful record in attracting revenue funding), however without further
investment this leadership position is in danger of being lost to other key UK and international centres
with the loss of key research jobs, skilled graduates and opportunities to commercialise research
outputs. It is noted that the region has the highest net outflow of PhDs of any English region.
Absence of a dedicated human tissue facility: Medical research relies heavily on the use of human
tissue, from both normal and diseased patients, however recent legislation (Human Tissue Act 2004)
has resulted in increased levels of bureaucracy and the requirement for dedicated human tissue
facilities, with appropriate standard operating procedures. Without these facilities the ability of research
institutions to collect and use human tissue in research is severely limited, affecting research income
and research productivity. The legislation has not only affected academic researchers but it has also
made it increasingly difficult for commercial companies to access human tissue samples.
Absence of specific analytical equipment: In order to study the molecular mechanisms underlying
human disease and develop new medical technologies, high specification equipment is required that
enables cellular and molecular events to be studied quickly and accurately on a global scale.
Biomedical equipment is a continuously evolving field and investment is required in this area to enable
the institutions to compete with similar organisations and attract further investment from research
funders and commercial partners. Without large scale investment in new equipment the partners'
competitive position is in jeopardy and commercial clients will seek research services from competitor regions.
Insufficient laboratory space to allow for necessary expansion of Translational Research
activity: Translational Research is undertaken at both Universities, however growth of this activity in
Warwick is hampered by restricted laboratory space. A new laboratory building is required to
consolidate existing resources, allow for expansion and to house new equipment.
Opportunity to develop Translational Research with partner NHS trusts: The University Hospital
Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust (UHBFT), in partnership with the University of Birmingham has '
established the Birmingham Clinical Research Academy, which aims to seamlessly translate research [
from the laboratory bench to patient bedside, to help.s;ave and prolong lives. In addition, collaboration
between the University of Warwick and the University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire (UHCW),
along with the Comprehensive Local Research Network will further promote Translational Research. 1
The alignment of this project with the ambitions of NHS partners to support Translational Research will &amp;middot;
enable the leverage of national NHS R&amp;amp;D funds via the newly formed National Institute for Health
Research (NIHR)</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>9564932</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">170004</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
