Confined to occasional social, business or official situations being interpreted is usually episodic and purposeful. The translated self is not a permanent condition. However, for Deaf British Sign Language users, this is not the case. Deaf people experience others' perceptions of who they are through sign language interpreter mediation on an everyday basis. Others' experience of Deaf people, largely formed indirectly through the use of interpreters, is rarely understood as intercultural, but typically through the lens of disability. To date analyses of translation and identity have focussed on the identity of the translator, but not on the user, and particularly not on the user who is in a permanent state of being translated. Through an interdisciplinary, mixed-methods, qualitative research design, this study will pioneer a new exploration of translation and culture. The project seeks to explore whether translation is constitutive of Deaf culture(s) in their formation, projection and transformation and the impact of consistently experiencing existence to others as a translated self on personal identity, achievement and well being. The results of the study will inform theories on translation, identity and well being, and will trial a new methodology for conducting research with visual languages. The results will also have an impact on stakeholder groups such as parents of deaf children, sign language interpreters, and hearing people that work with Deaf sign language users, as well as Deaf people themselves, in better understanding the consequences of a permanent condition of the translated self.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In line with Charles Forsdick's reflections on the Translating Cultures theme and his recommendations to bring findings of research and related activities to wider publics, build new communities and alliances, and to seek new audiences (see http://translating.hypotheses.org/404), the outputs of this project have been carefully considered in order to have impact on the non-academic community, including: the Deaf community, the wider hearing and hard-of-hearing (non-sign language using) community, Government bodies, third sector organisations, educationalists, parents with deaf children, and sign language translators and interpreters who function as intermediaries in the translation of the Deaf self. This research will provide an evidence base for potential policy changes in the UK in relation to Government Access to Work translation and interpreting provisions for Deaf people, as well as feeding in to training for Deaf sign language translators and hearing sign language interpreters, training for teachers of deaf children, and other hearing people that work in a professional capacity with Deaf people (such as social workers, audiologists, speech pathologists, disability advisors). Furthermore, the production of a bilingual educational drama in English and BSL on video, which will be disseminated through various forms of social media and entered into international Deaf film festivals, will ensure the wider impact of the research results on the international Deaf community, Deaf adults and young people. The major resulting impact is that the video will be available to be presented at academic conferences and non-academic community workshops, to deaf children at school, to sign language interpreters as part of professional development training and sign language interpreting students as part of their education, to hearing professionals as part of deaf awareness training workshops. Thus the resulting video will be utilized by academics, third sector (Deaf community and disability) organisations, professional associations and educational establishments to raise awareness about Deaf people's life experiences, about the role of signed language interpreters in mediating Deaf people's lives, the relationship between translation and identity, and the shared experiences of Deaf people in engaging in indirect communication.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-10-04</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-05</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>160402</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This product takes the form of three 1-2 minute video dramas in British Sign Language (BSL), the content of which was developed from key themes identified in the data.

1) EdSign lecture in Edinburgh, which is a series jointly offered by Heriot-Watt University with the University of Edinburgh and Queen Margaret University to share information about any research related to deafness and sign language topics. EdSign lectures are held monthly and are typically attended by 20-30 Deaf community members. The lectures are also live streamed through Google Hangout, meaning that the lectures reach a wider audience. The project team gave an EdSign lecture in May 2016.

2) British Deaf Association congress. This took place in July 2016 in Torquay and it is the key community engagement event for the British Deaf community, which is also attended by a range of stakeholders including service providers, interpreters, teachers of the deaf, parents with deaf children and third sector organisations. The project team delivered a presentation as part of the conference programme.

3) The team gave a presentation to 75 people at the Derby Deaf Club in September 2016 in order to disseminate the findings and show the three videos that were created as outputs from the project. This gave the team the opportunity to discuss the findings and generate further data.

4) The team gave a presentation about the project as part of a series of research presentations for the Deaf community in honour of deaf Scottish woman, Lilian Lawson, receiving an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in recognition of her work in advocating for the needs of the deaf BSL users, and her initiation of the BSL (Scotland) Bill (which was enacted in September 2015).

The SAG acts in a monitoring and advisory capacity to the research team to ensure cultural coherence with values and priorities of the Deaf community from the ethical perspective of research studies seeking consent on a community-wide basis as well as on an individual one. The key roles of the SAG have been to: 
? review the quality and relevance of the data collection technique and data analysis employed and the data proposed by the project team;
? review research project and plans
? provide advice as requested by the project team
? advise the project team on matters pertaining to recruitment of participants;
? network to promote and assist the project.

There are three planned SAG meetings during the project. Two meetings took place in June 2015 and January 2016, and the next meeting is planned in June 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d7145a12a4c7.82682543</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Third sector organisations</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015,2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>50000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>Unknown</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Applied Collaborative Research Scheme</gtr:description><gtr:end>2019-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Scottish Graduate School for Arts and Humanities (SGSAH)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>2ACE7637-5290-4F30-9A18-A7E17DB297A8</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>587a1edd410b71.73509699</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>75000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>European Union (EU)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>EUR</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>Austria</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>de_AT</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Erasmus+</gtr:description><gtr:end>2019-04-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>European Commission</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>B4603788-F79B-46BA-880F-0AC71DDCD3C1</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>587a1f39539e70.78785160</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-11-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The most significant achievement from the award is that we were able to push the boundaries of research in translation and interpreting studies, and also in social research, by exploring a previously un-researched topic. In particular the cross-disciplinary nature of the project has led to recommendations for further research, and has also contributed to theoretical understandings of deaf culture, translation and identity. We have discovered that the question of the relationship between the everyday lived experience of being translated does in fact appear to have an impact on the positive wellbeing of deaf sign language users. 

The award objectives were met in that we managed to collect data from all key stakeholder groups. One of the objectives that was not met satisfactorily was the data generation from parents with deaf children. We found it difficult to recruit people from this stakeholder group, and we have discussed the reasons for this in our project report.

We have made recommendations for further research, as the award was effectively for a scoping study. Now that we have confirmed that the question of the translated Deaf self is worth exploring as it is a legitimate concern for all stakeholder groups and that the innovative use of Stimulated Recall Interviews was an effective way of gathering data, we would like to explore the issues further and extend the methodologies to include other visual methods.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings may be taken forward by other academics in Translation and Interpreting Studies, Social Research, and Deaf Studies in order to explore the phenomenon of translation as being constitutive of culture. The findings may also be put to use by Deaf community organisations, and other third sector organisations that provide support to deaf adults and children (e.g., British Deaf Association, National Deaf Children Society, Action on Hearing Loss) and in the education and training of sign language interpreters. There is potential for the application of the findings by services that provide mental health support for deaf sign language users in understanding how their well being may be impacted by only being perceived by others through interpreters.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>63114D8D-145A-4109-BBF5-7F9FB6956893</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dc53c61b14a2.59713149</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://lifeinlincs.org</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Prof Jemina Napier - Dept of Work &amp;amp; Pensions Market Review of Access to Work &amp;amp; Interpreting</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A8C1D3F5-FA8B-4C93-B195-EB51231C28C1</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d97a9e125a83.34592287</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Prof Jemina Napier - Member of World Federation of the Deaf Expert Group on Accessibility</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7BA5EEF3-A7EB-437A-9314-ED5BC34CF537</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>587a1e4543cec8.23786580</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The collection of data in this project also involved the use of Stimulated Recall Interviews (SRIs) which have been used for the first time in this project with Deaf sign language users to examine their perceptions of 'being translated' and wellbeing.
