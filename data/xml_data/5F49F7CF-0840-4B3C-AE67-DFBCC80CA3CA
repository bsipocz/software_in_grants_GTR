The spatial variation that we see in almost all populations can tell us about the history of the species, and about how selection has acted. It is especially important now that we need to analyse the mass of DNA sequence data that has recently become available. However, until now there have been fundamental difficulties in formulating a consistent model of spatially continuous populations. We have developed just such a model, and shown how it can account for the large-scale changes that we see in real populations. In this project, we will extend the model to understand how selection acts in a spatial context. Amongst the questions we will ask are: How best to infer the history of a population from genetic data? Can selection on whole populations, rather than on individuals be effective? How do favourable genes spread through a species?</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Training of skilled people: The PDRAs employed on the project will develop considerable mathematical - in particular probabilistic - sophistication. Probability has been central to statistics and commonplace in physics for decades. Its economic and societal importance is illustrated by its indispensable roles in finance, in statistical genetics (e.g. hunting disease genes with exciting potential healthcare benefits) and in communication networks, to name but a few. Moreover, the two young people we train will be experienced in working at the interface between two disciplines. The resultant ability to communicate across traditional subject boundaries will place them in an enviable position for exploiting their mathematical skills in new settings and, in turn, passing their skills on to the next generation. Medicine, Agriculture and Conservation: Population genetic analysis of genome data is central to much medical and agricultural research. At the heart of identifying genes implicated in, for example, disease susceptibility, lies the inference of population histories from genetic data. A surprising feature of genetic data is that predictions are not usually greatly improved by increasing sample size. This presents real problems to the large community that uses genomic data to map quantitative trait loci (including disease loci). The `easiest' disease genes to track are those determined by a single genetic locus. But these are the exception and for diseases (or other traits) that are influenced by many interacting loci, the signals in the data can be swamped by information stemming from the `degree of relatedness' of individuals in the sample. A key problem in disentangling this `relatedness' is to properly account for the background demography, so finding the genes responsible for trait variation and disease susceptibility depends on having a sound model for population structure and that is precisely what our project aims to provide. Kingman's coalescent is currently the null model for relatedness in interpreting DNA sequence data, and thus plays a fundamental role in all of the burgeoning applications that flow from this. We ultimately aim to provide a testable way to extend the scope of this basic model to cover realistically structured populations, and anticipate that this will have wide application both in gene mapping and in conservation biology, and, more broadly, in work on biodiversity. Public engagement: Human beings are fascinated by history and increasingly fascinated by what our genes reveal about history. In a separate project, we have shown how the `reproductive value' of each ancestor determines the probability distribution of their contribution to future generations. Linking these ideas with the current project, we can ask whether populations in different places are likely to be genetically distinct, and about the extent of their common ancestry. We can also ask how this background pattern of relatedness interacts with selection for adaptation to local conditions. Such questions are important for conserving endangered species, but are also of intrinsic interest - especially when we consider populations of our own species.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>350885</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B56AB650-9635-45CF-87CA-4733A8E1EE2A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Coalescent simulation in continuous space: algorithms for large neighbourhood size.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Theoretical population biology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9c63964e4077a3d288c00e625613d207"><gtr:id>9c63964e4077a3d288c00e625613d207</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kelleher J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0040-5809</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5675dadc65883</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E4B0190D-D10B-4915-A9F9-9D30884AADC9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Efficient Coalescent Simulation and Genealogical Analysis for Large Sample Sizes.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>PLoS computational biology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9c63964e4077a3d288c00e625613d207"><gtr:id>9c63964e4077a3d288c00e625613d207</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kelleher J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1553-734X</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>585d4cf7b4e7a4.69000280</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7E5BF0E3-D106-4D1C-A5A2-D41652AEDDDE</gtr:id><gtr:title>Spread of pedigree versus genetic ancestry in spatially distributed populations.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Theoretical population biology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9c63964e4077a3d288c00e625613d207"><gtr:id>9c63964e4077a3d288c00e625613d207</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kelleher J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0040-5809</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5675eca0d7210</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/I013091/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>1A1A6805-9DC4-4BCE-BC70-9F2AA4FD093B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ecol, biodivers. &amp; systematics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>80</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DE30777A-E4A8-486B-875D-58CC92FD5525</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Population Ecology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>62309876-5C71-411C-B1A7-1B2907AFB5A8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>80</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Statistics &amp; Appl.
