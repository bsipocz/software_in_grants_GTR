This line of scholarship, which has traditionally taken place within discrete fields of inquiry, offers a new and compelling interdisciplinary approach to studying the relationships between Ireland, the Irish Diaspora and the African Diaspora in the Americas. Black and Green Atlantic scholarship is determined by an elision of gender based on a representational paradox: nineteenth and twentieth century female social actors are simultaneously figured in a-historic allegorical terms (i.e. 'Antigone', 'Joan of Arc') and yet physically threatened by violent haptic encounters - both when they appear on stage and in life. This investigation asks what is at stake in framing cultural and political exchange as masculine and liberatory when these same formations on the ground (as lived, experienced, felt) often suggest a very different story. \n\nThrough an investigation between different registers of social performance in which key female agents participate (oratory, ethnography, theatre making, playwriting and political activism) the book argues for a new kind of feminist intervention. Building on methods in performance studies, it makes sense of obscured alliances through using interpretive strategies where cultural expression is not reduced to text or narrative description. This analysis is organised around four historical flashpoints: Slavery, Jim Crow and the 'Irish Question' in the nineteenth century; Irish and Harlem Renaissances in the early twentieth century; civil rights movements in Northern Ireland and the U.S. South in the mid-twentieth century; the phenomena of multi-national globalization that radically changed political and social mobility in Ireland and the U.S. South in the late twentieth century. \n\nUsing these historical moments as a scaffold, the book pays careful attention to the popular dramatic forms that were ubiquitous during these four historical periods: Melodrama; 'Primitivist' Folk drama; Social Protest drama; and contemporary drama punctuated by a series of 'posts' (post-colonial, post-dramatic, post-feminist and post-racial). The book argues that these performance forms do not merely reflect social and political reality but animate and make meaningful political and social life. Examining the political and theatrical work of women such as Ida B. Wells, Maud Gonne, Zora Neale Hurston, Lady Augusta Gregory, Alice Childress and Bernadette Devlin the book aims to expose a central blind spot in the larger field of Atlantic Studies: by paying careful attention to how women's historical performances are repeatedly framed as singular and a-historic it will elucidate the unfinished business of Atlantic modernity. \n\nFinally, the book will offer a clear analysis of how to redirect the attention and methods of the current paradigm operating in Black and Green Atlantic scholarship across the disciplines.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The primary impact of the current project is to highlight how 'performance' offers a revolutionary perspective on the way history is lived and re-enacted in the present day. Its primary aim is to intervene in methodological debates across disciplines. As a forum for creating a new kind of dialogue between disciplines it has the potential to engage with a variety of public interest groups who often share distinct but related concerns. Drawing on the case studies and conceptual debates within my research I will program a public panel at the Tron Theatre in Glasgow during the Commonwealth Games in 2014. The purpose is to create a public forum where the theatre community and the Glasgow Anti-Racist Alliance (GARA) can explore common concerns. A critical intervention into the programming during this period will utilise the momentum of the Commonwealth Games to generate public interest and debate around issues that are immediately grounded in the changing ethnic and cultural landscape in the city of Glasgow. This has a dual function: \n\n1. to consider blind spots and under-theorised issues regarding 'representation' on Glasgow stages and in Glasgow theatre programming\n2. to examine how performance strategies could be utilised to advance GARA research into issues at the intersection of race and gender in the wider community\n\nUsing my research as a point of provocation for practitioners today, I will work with Andy Arnold, the artistic director at the Tron, to program a panel at the theatre on the themes of 'commonwealth' and 'postcolonial' that he is proposing. I will also contact GARA to ask if they would be interested in participating in a public conversation with the Glasgow theatre community. The aim is for the two organisations to mutually benefit from the conversation and to get members of the public who feel alienated from the concerns of the theatre community to join this discussion. The theatre community has an important role to play in reaching out to a wider public. The research at the Glasgow Anti-Racist Alliance is instrumental in exposing social ills and strategising ways to intervene. So far, the theatre community has been a tangential player in these conversations. This offers a real opportunity to think about the efficacy of representation in the city's theatres - on stage and in the audience - and for GARA to utilise the space of performance as another way of gathering information for their research. This information would be fruitful for theorising the intersection of race and gender as this is an area of research that is a blind spot in the organisation's research archive. \n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>41884</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The PI for this award has since left the institution for a post in the U.S. however, she did complete the monograph identified as the principal output for the award which was submitted as part of the Units REF portfolio</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>3F64BA24-7084-4474-AFF1-8D32F698DA7F</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5460e312d2cd42.12774002</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>n/a PI now has post in non UK HEI</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>n/a PI has another post in non UK institution</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>873B3533-39EE-4E91-A00B-83A2368F8FBB</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5460e3569c6133.85142422</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0EFBECB0-8044-4E3C-A843-A7B501D4CD08</gtr:id><gtr:title>Readings in Performance and Ecology</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ca52192defd03c5f6552c0b1bc0931a4"><gtr:id>ca52192defd03c5f6552c0b1bc0931a4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Arons, Wendy; May, Theresa J.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780230337282</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>i-5101595702.6757263be98140</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5FABA39D-0663-4967-BB9C-076CF8BE9DC3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Kinship and Performance in the Black and Green Atlantic: Haptic Allegories</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/926f6d3564c1015c5f3b72ecf5fa9764"><gtr:id>926f6d3564c1015c5f3b72ecf5fa9764</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gough Kathleen</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780415824002</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>i_71085188063bf2944c</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I001271/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>38E9B207-EFC4-4B48-AF70-C67AC5978934</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Drama &amp; theatre studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8C451D81-4626-46D5-BE5B-7B684CED97EF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural Studies &amp; Pop Culture</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>67D06C0B-53E4-47FE-8186-CBCE56A1271E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Gender &amp; Sexuality</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6BBE419C-DE2B-46C8-8935-A1B633C83A8A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Theatre &amp; History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
