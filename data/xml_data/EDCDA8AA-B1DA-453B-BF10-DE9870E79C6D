In Iain Chambers's words, '[t]heir bodies rest on the sea bed, unconsciously contributing to the solidifying of the sea, transforming a site of transit into a mounting barrier' (Chambers 2008). This situation is undoubtedly a crisis; not only of geopolitics, but also of values. Often unrecognised and unaccounted for, these deaths demand a response not just from advocacy groups, political organisations and governments, but also from those concerned with narrative, representation and the arts. The humanities are central to an exploration of social and cultural knowledge about contemporary migration and its effects. Focusing on the ways in which we interpret, represent and conceptualise forced migration in the twenty-first century, the arts and humanities provide an alternative perspective on a terrain usually considered to be that of law, sociology and political science. 
We aim to develop activist and interventionist models of the arts and humanities which have a positive impact on migrants' lives. This approach is undergirded by a rigorous conceptual analysis of three key questions: how adequate are current political, cultural, and social responses to forced migration? What is the status of humanitarian values in this crisis? And how can we narrate ethically this deathly turn in contemporary migration? Political, creative and academic sectors approach these issues in distinct ways. The aim of this project is to connect different scholarly disciplines on the issue of contemporary forced migration, and provide 'contact zones' between creative, theoretical, academic, and activist responses to this unfolding crisis. Moving beyond a consideration of the ethics of witnessing these multiple deaths, this project posits the arts and humanities as a means of changing public attitudes and influencing policy. It seeks to bring about the transformation of material possibilities through a heightened awareness of representational acts. 
Three international workshops will bring together artists, filmmakers, poets, practitioners, and scholars to draw on the creative energies of interdisciplinary working to develop collaborative 'response' as a methodological mode, including new creative works. As well as providing a platform for the existing work of migrant artists, such as Zineb Sedira, the ZALAB (Italy) migrant film collective and Platforma (UK), we will commission artists, photographers and poets to respond to the themes and outcomes of the project. Our project intervenes in and contributes to established community-cultural events, such as the Runnymede Literary Festival, by placing forced migration on the agenda. 
The project partners map a trajectory across varied geo-political contexts. In the UK, Keele and London provide peripheral and metropolitan perspectives on the migrant experience, while Glasgow situates questions of migration and national identity within a politically devolved Scotland. Our partnership with L'Orientale University, Naples, extends the geographical reach of the project to southern Europe. This will focus our attention on the Mediterranean as a visible site of the current failure to address the slowly unfolding crisis of forced migration at Europe's borders.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project aims to have a direct impact on migrants' lives by deploying the arts and humanities to transform public attitude and inform policies. The network will facilitate dialogue and knowledge exchange between academic and non-academic individuals and organisations, as well as generate creative, purposeful responses to the current crisis in forced migration. In addition to the academic benefits already identified, the project will lead to impacts in the following environments:

1.The network impacts directly on WRITERS AND ARTISTS in two ways: a) it will enable them to develop their artistic practice in response to the workshop themes [Poetic responses (workshop 1); photography, video installation and film (workshops 2 and 3) with Zineb Sedira and Kate Stanworth; theatre and testimony (workshop 3) with Actors for Human Rights and Kai Fischer]. b) Through active participation in the network where artistic perspectives will be informed by the work of theorists, practitioners and activists. 

2.Participants from THIRD-SECTOR ORGANISATIONS, CAMPAIGN GROUPS AND GRASSROOTS ORGANISATIONS (Refugee Council, Right to Remain, Detention Action, Fortress Europe) will benefit directly from historical and conceptual examinations of forced migration provided by humanities scholars and from the policy/legal detail provided by social scientists. The project will also impact indirectly on groups like: ASGI Italy, Immigration Law Practitioners Association (UK), COMPAS, European Council on Refugees and Exiles and the Migration Observatory. The project's website, where links, updates and resources will be available, will also host the e-pamphlet (see dissemination), which is specifically designed for wide dissemination by acting as a bridge between academic and non-academic audiences. This versatile resource will showcase responses developed at the workshops in order to prompt discussion and exchange within non-academic networks and broker long-lasting relationships between HE institutions and other sectors. 

3.POLICY MAKERS. We seek to engage (via dissemination channels and outputs) with lobbyist organisations such as: Migration Policy Center, The International Centre for Migration Policy Development and The European Programme for Integration and Migration. These groups effectively shape policy and have a direct impact on EU policy makers, who are target beneficiaries for the project. Our innovative methodology will open up lines of communication between academics working on migration and those non-academic researchers and lobbyists who are often unable to access academic outputs. Combining rigorous academic research and 'grey' literature, the pamphlet (see above and dissemination) and project strand on openDemocracy will expose policy makers to the most up to date thinking on forced migration from scholars across disciplines. 

4.THE WIDER PUBLIC. A number of Knowledge Exchange events will be open to the public to promote a more structured debate on the issue of forced migration [e.g. poetry competition for schools in response to Kate Stanworth's photography exhibition (Runnymede Literary Festival)]. We will run a 'project strand' on openDemocracy, which has 3.5 million unique views per year from across the globe and a very lively 'comments' section. The project's own website as well the involved partners' outreach channels will maximize public engagement. Our partnership with GRAMNet will also allow us to benefit the wider public through their channels of dissemination: a wide-ranging mailing list (which includes community and grassroots groups, academics, individuals, subject associations, research centres); blog (to which hundreds of readers subscribe); website (with dedicated pages for links, info and material).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>34314</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Poetic Responses to Contemporary Migration</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BF001640-D066-40FC-84B7-4A2A338FBC51</gtr:id><gtr:impact>An evening of poetry and film at Keele Hall (which, incidentally, had a brief incarnation as a refugee camp during WWII) forged connections between the arts and the ideas and questions that had arisen during the formal workshop. We heard from poets James Sheard, Saradha Soobrayen and Robert Hampson and the audience were encouraged to participate through 'Pebble Poetry' - an impact activity which engaged the audience by asking active participation in the process and encouraged a response 'written in stone'. Pebbles inscribed with words, phrases and responses from participants will travel from Keele to Naples and to London (our upcoming events in 2017), building a shore to safety and offering a welcome written in stone.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c91c7c4b3115.45296288</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://respondingtocrisis.wordpress.com/2016/09/08/sign-up-for-our-first-workshop/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Contemporary crisis of values and 'necropolitics'</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3A338AAF-40F4-47D2-A244-3B44E200DDCC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Our aim was to share knowledge, skills and experience in the area of forced migration and we heard from academics, arts practitioners, and those who work in the voluntary sector. How can we enable productive collaborations on the issue of forced migration?

Who are the intended audiences of the artistic practices by or about refugees?

How can we create a third space for dialogue about refugees that is not political or personal, but social?

These are just a few of the questions raised by participants at our inaugural workshop at Keele university in October. Interrogating the ideas underpinning the project in critical and productive ways, the contributions from participants will help shape the network and our coming events in Naples and at Royal Holloway in London.We gained valuable context in the form of the historical legacy of colonialism from Roger Bromley, and Neelam Srivastava raised important questions about contemporary and historical practices of commemoration for refugees, showing a clip from Dagmawi Yimer's 2013 film Asmat/Names. Taking us into the mechanics of seeking asylum, Anthony Good and Carolina Albuerne spoke from their research and practice with asylum claimants, exposing the inadequacies of current systems for applying for asylum and raising crucial questions like: how can we get better at facilitating refugees to speak for themselves? What constitutes self-representation? And how can we be better advocates with a sense of our own positioning? Kristin Shirling, who has been working with Good Chance theatre in the Calais 'Jungle', voiced her strong support for the role of the arts in situations of crisis, arguing that when one is dehumanised, a place to 'be a human being' is vitally important. Jerome Phelps's discussion of the spatialisation of power worked across scholarly and practice-based approaches to forced migration by grounding his comments in the campaign against the UK Government's detention estate run by Detention Action.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c91b395166e9.36876912</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://respondingtocrisis.wordpress.com/2016/09/08/sign-up-for-our-first-workshop/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>radio broadcast</gtr:description><gtr:form>A broadcast e.g. TV/radio/film/podcast (other than news/press)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1990EF36-48A2-48D5-81D6-8D3D970DE883</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I was invited by the BBC Radio Stoke to talk about the engagement event - which was going to be held later in the week - and about the project.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c91dee1817d1.59004597</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p047qsb8#play</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>300</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>'Arts for Advocacy': Creative Engagement with Forced Displacement in Morocco</gtr:description><gtr:end>2018-03-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Economic and Social Research Council</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>ES/P004598/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>B9DEDDEC-9C05-443A-9463-8257BBE23601</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c9371d3fad36.55822535</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5D00D140-06AC-4A5C-B2C8-C7F1DF6796D6</gtr:id><gtr:title>Borderlands: words against walls</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/0d39893294e85839ae3c71d82877fb7d"><gtr:id>0d39893294e85839ae3c71d82877fb7d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mariangela Palladino</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c93d93061d50.01516616</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>10FE15B9-DF06-477D-A415-2044A071EB54</gtr:id><gtr:title>The arts and humanities: tackling the challenges of mass displacement</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/02d6aaec0325a7fdf7ff9269e76206f9"><gtr:id>02d6aaec0325a7fdf7ff9269e76206f9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Agnes Woolley</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c93dddc61b01.93323619</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/M009645/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FB301405-099D-44B9-ADA9-75B11FDED8C0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>English Language &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9DFBE9F1-538E-4C96-B606-5163472E6960</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Literary &amp; Cultural Theory</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EF860896-6A4B-4EF6-A42E-F78E49ED901F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Post-Colonial Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
