Recent research suggests that these bilingual groups show similar behavior (both have difficulties with the interface between language and pragmatics, eg processing referential expressions) but there has been no systematic comparison of their online processing.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project will provide such a comparison.&amp;nbsp;The hypothesis is that these difficulties are caused by inefficiency of the executive function mechanisms controlling attention. These mechanisms are taxed in bilinguals, as they constantly have to suppress one language when they speak or hear the other. Executive function and eye-tracking experiments will be conducted to investigate processing of referential expressions. Conditions of high executive load (when speakers have to switch languages) will be compared to conditions of low load (no language switching required).&amp;nbsp;Speakers? recovery from inhibition of the unselected language, and how this affects processing, will also be investigated.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>349219</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Refereed conference presentation (poster)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>807D7B8F-EBA3-497D-81A4-307515F6F0A0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The poster attracted many useful comments and sparked a lively discussion

As such, they are relevant for the public engagement activities that the PI and one of the co-PIs regularly conduct through the research and information centre Bilingualism Matters. The aim of Bilingualism Matters is to provide correct information about bilingualism and language learning across the lifespan in different sectors of society. Since adult late bilingualism is one of the key areas of engagement, the results of this project can inform public awareness and language learning educational policy.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>A260A267-9E78-434F-B95F-C18AAECC0232</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d2bf5baf62b9.46730272</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Traditionally, language knowledge acquired in childhood has been considered to be largely stable over time. However, this idea has recently been challenged, resulting in a view of language as adaptive. This project examined the dynamic nature of human language by comparing two late bilingual groups: speakers undergoing native language attrition due to long-term exposure to a second language (L1 attriters) and second language (L2) learners, who have acquired a
second language post puberty.

We hypothesized that the similarity between L1 attriters and L2
learners can be attributed to a competition between the resources needed to select the appropriate language when processing an utterance and those required by coordinating grammar and context. This competition should manifest itself when bilinguals have to switch languages: in this situation, the executive control system (that distributes attention between tasks) has an increased resource demand, thus context effects should be clearly visible.

The aims of the project were to:

(a) systematically compare L1 attriters and L2 learners in their
language comprehension of structures that depend in different degree on contextual factors;

(b) test the hypothesis that competition for processing resources underlies the similar behavior observed in L1 attriters and L2 learners with syntax-pragmatics structures;

(c) investigate the extent to which this competition results in
cross-linguistic influence in L1 attriters and L2 learners;

(d) investigate whether L1 attriters and L2 learners show the same direction of crosslinguistic influence.

We conducted a series of experimental studies investigating language comprehension in late Italian/English bilinguals, who were either attrited L1 speakers of Italian (with English as L2), or L2 speakers of Italian (with English as L1). The experiments were eye-tracking experiments investigating priming, using both lexical decision and a visual world paradigms, as well as one self-paced reading study. All
participants were given an extensive battery of test investigating executive control.

The results with respect to our initial aims (a)-(d) can be summarized as follows:

(a) We found that L1 attriters and L2 learners behaved broadly
similar, across all the experiments we conducted, including for
context-dependent structures.

(b) We operationalized the notion of competition for resources as switching cost, i.e., as a slow-down or reduction in performance when a speaker has to switch between languages. We found that switching costs for L1 attriters and L2 learners are similar, as per our initial hypothesis.

(c) and (d) We failed to find crosslinguistic influences in
competition (switching cost did not vary with the direction of
switching or L1/L2 status). However, we found that differences in executive control correlate with differences in switching cost. This leads to the new hypothesis that the competition varies across individuals, rather than crosslinguistically.

To summarize, our results show remarkable similarities between L1 attriters and L2 learners in language comprehension. This contrasts with the differences (e.g., in switching cost) that have been documented in the literature on language production in these two populations. The influence of executive control is observable on an individual level only.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The field of bilingualism research is currently experiencing an intense debate about the validity of findings showing differences in cognitive functions between mono- and bilinguals. The evidence so far is conflicting, with some studies showing a significant advantage in particular in executive functions in bilinguals, others showing no difference between the groups. Our results add a new dimension to this debate. By showing that individual differences in executive functions interact with he performance on the visual world paradigm we introduce a new variable, which could, at least in part, account for the divergent findings in the literature. We are planning to continue and expand this line of research in Edinburgh. Specifically, we intend to study how pre-existing differences in executive functions can influence language learning and predict its outcome, both in terms of linguistic abilities and potentially associated cognitive differences. Given the current interest in bilingualism and executive functions we assume that such an approach will become influential and is likely to get adopted by other research groups working in this field.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>494A4A28-0426-4325-BC9A-EEBFB1A0BEEA</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>55533b11cb8e20.01972542</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>04C70046-C630-451B-BDA7-9486C0331D33</gtr:id><gtr:title>Referring expressions and executive functions in bilingualism</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Linguistic Approaches to Bilingualism</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/113ddb57583518b199d80312c2e16eb4"><gtr:id>113ddb57583518b199d80312c2e16eb4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Sorace A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>18799264</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a9c354a29bfb4.22329559</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-062-23-2919</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/I009590/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>B94A2498-60DA-4055-A957-686B6CB42654</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Linguistics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>28710E94-8B47-404A-BD40-7BCB8C709774</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Linguistics (General)</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
