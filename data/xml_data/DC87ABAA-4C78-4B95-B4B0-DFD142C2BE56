What was a nation of emigration - to Latin America a century ago, to central Europe in the 1950s - has become a place to which many people from across the globe come in search of work and refuge. In addition to those from former colonies, there are now large numbers of people from North and sub-Saharan Africa, China and Pakistan who have settled in Spain. The increasing prominence of these diaspora in everyday life, their impact on the body politic, and the direct exposure of native Spaniards to their cultures have triggered debate in public and private about the Spanish nation and the singularly white, European (and Catholic) ethnicity that is, according to some, indigenous to its territory.\n\nBecause the establishment of sizeable diasporic communities in Spain occurred only recently, the impact on cultural production in Spain of residents of foreign origin has been slight. Nevertheless, an increasing number of films, plays, novels, songs and other artworks are now being produced by these groups or involve them in some way in order to explore issues stemming from their presence in Spain. In parallel, scholarly studies have appeared on the artistic representation of non-white people in contemporary Spanish culture and of issues such as immigration and multiculturalism.\n\nThis existing literature is limited in scope in that it examines only individual genres. My project, of which the AHRC Fellowship will form part, is more inclusive in its cross-disciplinary focus on performance and the meanings inscribed on the performer's body. Its preliminary studies include analyses of how the 'fact' (as Fanon described it) of blackness of actors of African origin in Spain affects the roles in which they are cast, and of performances by 'white' Spanish actors in blackface.\n\nThe Fellowship will build upon this initial research by exploring how members of the African diaspora in Spain can, by means of performance, assume agency and implement strategies of resistance in the face of political subjugation and discrimination on account of the colour of their skin. This will result in two academic articles, the publication of interviews with performers and a series of theatre workshops.\n\nIn the first part of the Fellowship, I will examine the work of two rap musicians of the African diaspora: Frank T (Tshimini Nsombolay), born in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and El Choj&amp;iacute;n (Domingo Edjang Moreno), son of a Guinean father and Spanish mother. These rappers routinely comment in their songs and their prose writings on their own hybrid identities and on the issue of racial prejudice more generally. The planned article will analyse not only studio recordings of their songs, but also how these two rap musicians exploit live performance and its potential for direct interaction with audiences to raise awareness of and provoke debate on 'race' and ethnic difference. To this end, interviews with these musicians will be arranged following initial research on the topic.\n\nThe second part of the Fellowship will initially run parallel to the first part. From September, I will organise and run a series of weekly workshops as a volunteer at the Centro Hispano Africano in Madrid, a social centre founded to provide migrants from sub-Saharan Africa with personal, professional and legal assistance and to facilitate integration and intercultural exchange. Over the course of the workshops, I will introduce participants to techniques of Theatre of the Oppressed and encourage them to reflect on and explore through performance some of the problems that affect directly their everyday lives as Africans in Spain. The impact of these theatre activities on participants will be determined by means of questionnaires and discussion sessions.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Both of the component projects of the Fellowship will benefit directly the African community in Spain, especially that in Madrid. The study of rap musicians Frank T and El Choj&amp;iacute;n will raise their international reputation by bringing their recorded output, live performances and role as spokesmen for a generation of people of African origin in Spain to the attention of specialists in contemporary Hispanic culture and society as well as scholars of contemporary popular music in the English-speaking world. This will be accomplished by the publication of my analysis and of my interviews with them in journals to which academic institutions in the USA, UK and Spain subscribe. The series of theatre workshops that I will run at the Centro Hispano Africano in Madrid, it is intended, will strengthen participants' awareness that they can respond constructively to discrimination and will provide users of the centre with a set of theatrical tools that can be employed in order to present and reflect collaboratively upon possible actions to be taken if they experience prejudice.\n\nBy acknowledging and supporting the agency of those marginalised on account of the colour of their skin in Spain, the two parts of the Fellowship will also impact indirectly on the Spanish society of which these communities form part, aiding cooperation between diaspora and the indigenous population and integration of these two groups without compromising the former's ethnic identity. I will publish my description and assessment of the value of the workshops and those obstacles to progress encountered during the series in a journal read by academics and practitioners in Spain for future reference by those working in the broader field of Theatre for Development.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-04-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>30210</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Complutense University of Madrid</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Spain, Kingdom of</gtr:country><gtr:description>European Popular Musics Research Group</gtr:description><gtr:id>8C33D6C5-63EF-4AC0-8906-B71BB70A6FA4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Special issue of Journal of European Popular Culture: 'European Popular Musics: A Polycentric Dialogue' (4.1, 2013).

My talk is followed by discussion as regards how the information I provide can be used in the classroom with students 14-18 years of age to teach about Spanish language, culture and society.

Teachers readily embrace the content of my talk: rap music is popular with young people, the experiences of the Afro-Spanish rappers I speak about are real-life experiences (rather than inventions for a textbook), and the topics they touch upon in their work are easily incorporated into the syllabus (e.g. A2 topic of race and immigration).

This event was preceded by a series of schools events on how rap engages with questions of race and immigration in Spain (a prominent A2 topic).
The event also gave schoolchildren the opportunity to experience university social life.

This event only took place on 16 October 2014. We expect its impact to include: a rise in numbers of GCSE students continuing to study the topic at A-level in West Yorkshire; a rise in the number of A-level students enrolling on Spanish degree programmes across the UK; the creation of classroom activities by school teachers based on the music and lyrics of El Choj&amp;iacute;n and other Afro-Spanish rappers.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5452338b935270.94808553</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>20790</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Leverhulme Visiting Fellowship</gtr:description><gtr:end>2015-01-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>The Leverhulme Trust</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>RG.SPLA.100454</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>1D6F32A2-43D0-4E9C-81C4-4EE07A053205</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5461eca8dfaf69.74887087</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-05-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>This award led directly to the live concert by Spanish rapper El Choj&amp;iacute;n at Leeds University Union on 16 October 2014, attended by some 400 university students, school students between the ages of 14 and 18, local fans of hip-hop, and Spanish fans of the artist in and around West Yorkshire.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>2DD3BB88-57A7-4E6F-9C82-00A8A7C6DFB1</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5461f33801e0c4.72476426</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Rap music (in both recorded form and live performance) was the first forum in which Spanish residents of immigrant origin were able to speak for themselves about their lives and particularly the racism they experience(d). This commenced in the mid-90s, some 5 years before the immigration boom and well before other more culturally prestigious forms of cultural production (film, theatre) began to be employed by immigrants to raise issues affecting them. (In theatre, it's debatable whether this has happened at all).
Rap music in Spain produced by musicians of African origin differs from that produced by African-Americans on account of their different roots. The frequent collaborations between musicians from Equatorial Guinea (the sole Spanish colony in sub-Saharan Africa until independence in 1968) exemplify the much closer connections between Afro-Spanish rappers and Africa. This is a very different dynamic from what Paul Gilroy identifies in his The Black Atlantic (1993), and has enabled me to challenge the assumptions of this canonical postcolonial text.
I was able to develop further my interest in Spanish popular music and artists of immigrant origin in further publications on a rapper born in the Dominican Republic (who draws on Caribbean sounds) and a singer born to Equatorial Guinean parents (who performs flamence and Latin jazz). These studies have allowed me to nuance my study of how people of immigrant origin can use both lyrics and musical styles/samples to draw attention to social issues and to declare their belonging to an international community on account of their marginalization in their country of residence, frequently because of the colour of their skin.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Emboldened by the success of my talks to schools and schoolteachers on rap and immigration, I expressed my interest in forming part of the Steering Groups set up by Michael Gove to review the teaching of modern languages in schools. Unfortunately I was unsuccessful (something about which I was very disappointed, especially on discovering whom they organisers had accepted onto the Steering Groups).
The next step of the European Popular Musics Research Group that I founded with Isabelle Marc (Universidad Complutense de Madrid) is to request funding to create an international network of modern linguists working on transcultural elements of youth culture. Activities will include working with schoolteachers and schools in Yorkshire to enable them to inspire and teach students of modern languages more successfully.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>98E0473E-D0F6-4838-B85B-49B345ECE34A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5461f895bdd402.07368601</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4AC8192D-6503-44B5-B63E-2112CB8FEEF1</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Musical Routes of the Spanish Black Atlantic: The Performance of Identities in the Rap of Frank T and El Choj&amp;Atilde;&amp;shy;n</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Popular Music and Society</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/240e14560dcaa81e900c9f0dbdea6155"><gtr:id>240e14560dcaa81e900c9f0dbdea6155</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Green S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>541af985c6f7d3.73569086</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>00D35120-9E1F-4353-805E-DF49B601A7A0</gtr:id><gtr:title>&amp;iquest;C&amp;oacute;mo puedes ser tan negro?: Rap y racismo en Espa&amp;ntilde;a.
