These objects arise naturally in the mathematical study of symmetry and partial symmetry. Given any mathematical structure on a set, the collection of structure-preserving mappings from the set to itself form a monoid, the collection of all symmetries form a group, while the partial symmetries give rise to an inverse monoid. In this way these algebraic objects pervade mathematics. 

One way to represent a group, monoid of inverse monoid is via a presentation. The elements are represented by strings of letters, called words. We are also given a set of pairs of words, called defining relations, which are rules telling us that certain pairs of words are equal to each other. Then two words are defined to be equal if one can be turned into the other by a sequence of applications of the defining relations. For example, using the alphabet with the letters a and b, and just with a single defining relation ab=ba, the words aba and aab are equal since aba = a(ba) = a(ab) = aab. On the other hand, the words bb and ab are not equal since one cannot be transformed into the other using the relation ab=ba. 

A famous result in twentieth century mathematics shows that there does not exist, in general, an algorithm to decide whether two words are equal in a monoid defined by a finite presentation. This is known as the word problem, and is also undecidable in general both for finitely presented groups and inverse monoids. These results are important since they were some of the first concrete natural decision problems proven to be undecidable in general. The importance of the word problem is clear: decidability of the word problem for a class of algebras indicates that we have some hope of studying the structural properties of algebras in the class, while undecidability of the word problem would suggest there would likely to be major difficulties in investigating the class as a whole.

Given that the word problem is undecidable in general, a lot of research has been done to identify classes of monoids for which the word problem is decidable. One fundamental idea is that by restricting the number of defining relations in the presentation, this should limit the complexity of the object that it defines. An important result of this kind for groups is Magnus's theorem which shows that groups defined by a single defining relation all have decidable word problem. In contrast to this, the following problem remains open:

Open problem. Is the word problem decidable for monoids with a single defining relation? 

This important problem has been open for more than half a century, and is one of the main motivations for our research project. Rather than attacking this problem directly, the project instead aims to develop various aspects of the theory of certain inverse monoids, called special inverse monoids. Specifically the project will develop certain important tools from theoretical computer science, from the area of rewriting systems, to investigate the subgroups, structure, and geometry of these inverse monoids. We will then apply this theory to investigate the word problem for these inverse monoids which will then lead to important results about decidability of the word problem, in general, for monoids defined by a single defining relation. 

The project will involve extensive collaboration with researchers both from the UK and from universities in Portugal, Serbia and the USA. We will organise a workshop midway through the project, centred around its main themes, which will bring together leading experts from a diverse range of topics in algebra, logic and theoretical computer science.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This is a wide-ranging project which has connections with numerous different topics in mathematics and computer science. The immediate impact of the project will be felt in these research areas, and is outlined in the National Importance and Academic Impact section of the Case for Support. The details of how academics working in these areas will benefit from the research is explained in the Academic Beneficiaries section. Also, the Pathways to Impact statement outlines how the project has been designed to maximise its impact in mathematics and other disciplines, and its potential future applications outside academia. 

In this section we concentrate on the longer-term potential impact of this project and its subject area.

One of the central problems motivating this research project is the question of decidability of the word problem for one-relation monoids. Algorithmic questions such as this are of central importance to contemporary research in algebra, logic and combinatorics. This question is fundamental, and answering it would be a huge step forward in our general understanding of the boundary between problems which are decidable and those that are not. The problem has been open for more than half a century and is regarded as one of the key unresolved questions about decidability. Because of this, the progress that is made on this problem as a consequence of the research done in this project, has the potential for major long-term impact. The results will be of interest to experts working in combinatorial and geometric group and semigroup theory, algorithms decidability and complexity, rewriting systems, automata theory and formal language theory. If the project leads to a positive solution to the word problem, as well as being a major result, this would open up a whole host of new questions to be explored, such as complexity of the word problem, and whether such monoids admit presentations by complete rewriting systems. On the other hand, if the project led to a counterexample, then new techniques would have been needed for its construction (e.g. methods encoding the halting problem into the relation) and these techniques would then be explored and developed further by other researchers to obtain applications to other decidability questions. 

Since the project has connections with such a diverse range of topics, another long-term impact it will have is to strengthen the connections between these areas. As explained in the National Importance and Academic Impact section of the Case for Support, there has been a recent trend aimed at increasing communication and collaboration internationally between researchers in semigroup theory and group theory, algorithms, decidability and complexity, combinatorics, constraint satisfaction and connections with logic and model theory. This is demonstrated by numerous conferences and workshops that have been held over the past few years at which researchers with different areas of expertise from these fields have been brought together to share their ideas, methods and results. This research project builds on, and continues, this trend. It will strengthen connections between several different areas of mathematics and computer science. This will also ensure that researchers from different areas are involved in explaining their work to a broader audience, which in turn helps them understand how to explain it to an audience outside of their immediate area of expertise. In this way, this project will indirectly have a positive impact on the understanding and appreciation of mathematics in the wider population.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-07-04</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-07-05</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100576</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Societal impact arising from the award: 

The topic of the research project formed the basis of a mini-course that I gave at the School of Algebra, XXIV Brazilian Algebra Meeting, Diamantina, in August 2016. This course was attended by many masters and PhD students who should have benefited from the course, and from interaction with me. Ideas from my research project will also form the basis of some of the material I will present this coming summer at the &amp;quot;LMS Undergraduate Summer School 2017&amp;quot; at the University of Manchester. The aim of the LMS School is to introduce modern mathematics to the best UK undergraduates who are not currently in their final year of study. This will give me the opportunity for me to use ideas from my research project to help inspire and encourage the next generation of mathematicians in the UK, many of whom will go on to work outside academia in the future.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>919ED4DD-DCD1-4F88-8E8C-8B38C492E152</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>58bdc1f6d3b540.44288207</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D44AD23A-F13B-4BD5-8AC0-8D9FFE7BA49D</gtr:id><gtr:title>On regularity and the word problem for free idempotent generated semigroups</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9a253cac354ab458eefb46dff23650ab"><gtr:id>9a253cac354ab458eefb46dff23650ab</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dolinka I</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58bc41530ce0e6.48561202</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C7130B8E-FBED-4B1F-91D6-641AD1EB58F1</gtr:id><gtr:title>On finite complete rewriting systems, finite derivation type, and automaticity for homogeneous monoids</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Information and Computation</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/38ccf7753a85b04fcb4253173e814856"><gtr:id>38ccf7753a85b04fcb4253173e814856</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cain A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a872cb35d6025.34837354</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8355EAE7-EABE-4401-A2EB-9EC9E29B8645</gtr:id><gtr:title>Universal locally finite maximally homogeneous semigroups and inverse semigroups</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Forum Mathematicum</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9a253cac354ab458eefb46dff23650ab"><gtr:id>9a253cac354ab458eefb46dff23650ab</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dolinka I</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a6759b55d8927.18884998</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>53D6AA0D-7600-44F3-8134-726CD409E252</gtr:id><gtr:title>Diagram monoids and Graham-Houghton graphs: Idempotents and generating sets of ideals</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series A</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ffb82920c28faa0419e5b19eaaf120f4"><gtr:id>ffb82920c28faa0419e5b19eaaf120f4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>East J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58bc41fe357981.04536966</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/N033353/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>27F853CB-FB22-4B9D-82D7-542648D097F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>60</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Algebra &amp; Geometry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9A30FDC6-AEB7-447C-A30E-0EF6BDB406FB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Logic &amp; Combinatorics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
