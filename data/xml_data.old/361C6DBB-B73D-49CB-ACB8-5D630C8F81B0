This Pathfinder proposal aims to evaluate the market receptivity of a sensor of this nature and provide an opportunity to explore commercial and end users partnerships for its development. In power plants and other nuclear related sites, such as Sellafield in the UK, the monitoring of radionuclides in water has to be performed regularly to ensure the protection of the workforce and neighbouring communities. The monitoring requires collecting large quantities of water by manual sampling and analysing them after they have been transported to laboratory facilities. To simplify this process, we have developed polymeric compounds that can selectively retain 99TcO4- from water at low concentration, using chemical affinity for this ion in solution. The proposed sensor harnesses the ability of these polymer compounds to selectively retain 99Tc from water in order to concentrate this radionuclide from solution and allow its in situ quantification (i.e. analysis can be performed on site) using a radiation detector. By integrating existing reliable technology with newly synthesized polymeric matrices we are creating the next generation of portable sensors for the field detection of radionuclides in contaminated sites. The activities proposed in this Pathfinder will strengthen knowledge of the sensors market size and provide an opportunity to involve end users and regulators via close interactions with current project partners Practical Controls Ltd and Environmental Monitoring Solutions Ltd. These are essential steps to building a sound foundation for our future Follow on project from a technical and market perspective; ensuring that future applications are attractive to end users and that commercial interest can be secured.

In producing this sensor, the following impacts are envisaged:

- Improving UK businesses: This project will directly improve the business performance of Practical Controls Ltd and Environmental Monitoring Solutions (our project partners). Practical Controls are leaders in designing and commercializing products and this sensor will open new markets and help strengthen their position at the top of the UK electronics and software design market. Environmental Monitoring Solutions will also benefit directly from this new sensor, by expanding their current portfolio and gaining access to unique solutions for highly specialized problems in a very competitive market. This will help grow and expand their current operations. As the project progresses, we envisage an impact on other businesses. We aim to engage with the remediation and contaminated land sector and other instrumentation businesses in the nuclear sector that will benefit from using or commercialising the technology presented here.

- Providing solutions for end-users: By engaging with end users such as Sellafield Ltd. in the UK and ANDRA in France, we are directly benefiting the operations that these organisations are conducting. The sensor to be developed in this project will enable accurate and fast monitoring in decommissioning and management of radioactive waste. This will significantly improve site characterization and provide essential information for the design of appropriate routes of disposal, waste treatment options and disposal needs. In situ monitoring will also help safeguard the health of the workforce in decommissioning and disposal sites and protect the building infrastructure. The most immediate benefit for these users is the ability to monitor radionuclides in groundwater at low concentration. This will significantly reduce both time in operations related to monitoring and characterization, and analysis costs.

- Providing Policy leadership: The technology developed in this project will impact the way sensitive radionuclide data is collected. This will significantly improve the reliability and accessibility of information and speed up responses in emergency situations. The ability to quickly acquire radionuclide concentration in the field will put UK policy-makers at the forefront of regulatory operations by providing leadership in Europe on radionuclide information. We will achieve this by working with the Environment Agency, the main regulatory body responsible for establishing contamination limits of radionuclides in water. This will contribute to better policy and regulation, increase understanding on processes of environmental change and allow improved forecasting of sensitive contamination that has an impact on the environment and human health.

- Building a secure and resilient society: The introduction of a sensor that can provide real time information on contamination from radio-nuclear sources will benefit the UK plc. greatly. Early warning detection of hazards and threats enables more effective assessment, response and recovery in emergency situations. Access to contamination information will increase resilience and provide confidence, ensuring continuity in public and business activities. In the long term, a sensor such as the one proposed here, will contribute to a continuous monitoring of radionuclide contamination that will help to change the public perception of the nuclear sector in general.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-09-24</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-03-25</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>12290</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Practical Control Limited</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Sensors for nuclear detection - PCL</gtr:description><gtr:id>BEADCA78-22FC-4C20-8412-A38506089A47</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Submission of research funding to NERC under the Innovation Follow on Fund scheme</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e96a2c7ec941.97130112-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Practical controls limited provides experience in electronics, sensor development, housing and production.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>University of Sheffield provides knowledge on the use of polymeric compounds for the retention of nuclear compounds.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>There is a need for sensors for the nuclear industry for Sr and Ce.
