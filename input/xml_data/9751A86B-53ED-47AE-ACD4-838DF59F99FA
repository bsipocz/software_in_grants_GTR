Critical appreciation of his achievement, however, has been stubbornly unforthcoming in the wider academic field: there is still no authoritative scholarly biography of the composer, and analytical accounts of Delius's music remain at a preliminary stage, especially when placed alongside coverage for other comparably significant musical figures. Given recent events following his anniversary year in 2012 (including John Bridcut's acclaimed documentary for BBC4, and a 2-day conference devoted to his work run by the Delius Society), the time is ripe for an urgent re-evaluation of Delius's music, reflecting upon his wider significance as an internationally-oriented creative figure writing at a crucial moment in the emergence of a complex and multivalent musical modernism. 

The critical reception of some of Delius's most popular works, such as 'On Hearing the First Cuckoo in Spring', has often inadvertently perpetuated the idea of rhapsodist whose apparent lack of strong formal structure and rich late romantic harmonic syntax seemingly place him at odds with more supposedly progressive trends in continental European music. Systematic attention to Delius's biography and critical consideration of his major works, however, swiftly suggests a more dynamic and challenging musical idiom, and a keen sense of musical architecture. Contemplating Delius's work furthermore challenges our understanding of the relationship between music and place. Delius spent key parts of his professional career in Florida, Scandinavia, Germany, and France, and thinking more rigorously through the diverse spaces and places of his compositional development through the close reading of selected key works reveals a richly multilayered sense of musical identity. Delius thus destabilises familiar narratives of musical place. By drawing on more theoretically grounded models from recent writing in Cultural Geography, I will argue that Delius's music profoundly re-centres our understanding of place in music, not as a fixed or reductive category, but rather through a process of flux or drift--one that enables us to recontextualise his work within a more genuinely critical framework and to attend to his music's diverse subjectivities in a more sophisticated way.

Engaging in greater detail with Delius's work thus has important implications, both, at a music-technical level, for understanding why he was so influential upon early twentieth-century music, and, more figuratively, for challenging and elevating our sense of the complex relationships between music, place, and identity. Though Delius's musical cosmopolitanism is always inevitably bound up with an experience of absence and loss, critical contemplation of his work can only enrich our appreciation of the ways in which certain kinds of music--particular turns or phrase, gestures, or shapes--can invoke specific states of mind or senses of being-in-place. 'Delius and the Sound of Place' hence becomes, in essence, an analytical exercise in musical phenomenology. It is simultaneously, however, a tightly source-based historical-contextual study in representation and reception that will provide its own interpretative insights into an especially complex moment of musical creativity and expression.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The non-academic beneficiaries of the Fellowship include musicians and performers, journalists, teachers in secondary music education, and members of the general public. Impact will be achieved in a number of ways: by raising Delius's public profile through various media (including radio, public talks, and programme notes, workshops and other public events); by advancing new ways of thinking about his music and its historical context; by prompting fresh, more critically informed ways of thinking about music and place; by promoting the wider knowledge and accessibility of Delius's manuscript sources and archival materials; and by fostering future musical researchers and tertiary study. Significant public interest in issues which will form the basis for the Fellowship's research has already been generated through my appearance in John Bridcut's widely-reviewed BBC 4 film, 'Delius: Composer, Lover, Enigma', commissioned for the composer's 2012 anniversary: it is precisely the momentum which this film has generated, and the resulting opportunities for developing further forms of public impact as a result, that have served as one of the primary points of departure for the Fellowship.

The Fellowship's principal output, a scholarly monograph, can be confidently expected to appeal to a broadly non-specialist musical readership above and beyond its primary audience of advanced undergraduates, research students, and more senior scholars. Previous comparable publications have been widely reveiwed in the general press. The Delius Society, a public group that energetically promotes interest in the composer through a range of activities and publications, will be an important forum for attracting non-specialist readers to the volume. As indicated in the accompanying 'Pathways to Impact' statement, I have already worked sucessfully with the society on previous events, and the proposed project enjoys their keen interest and support.

An equally integral part of the Fellowship's proposed Work Plan will be a series co-ordinated research events, directed toward both academic and non-academic participants. Workshops and Study Days at the Royal Academy of Music and the British Library will be open to members of the general public, with appropriate opportunities for discussion, feedback, and Knowledge Exchange. The Delius Online Catalogue (DOC) will be freely accessible online, and its beneficiaries will be musicians, performers, journalists, and members of the public, alongside music students and academics in a range of disciplines. Impact through the DOC will be achieved by raising the profile of Delius's work, highlighting neglected areas of his corpus, and illuminating problematic aspects of realisation and interpretation, for instance by clarifying the scribal contributions of Eric Fenby and Thomas Beecham in his manuscripts. 

Further impact will be achieved through a Study Day for Sixth Form Students, exploring themes of authenticity, cultural transfer and identity in Delius's setting of the folksong 'Brigg Fair'. The aim of the Study Day will be to try to develop a tighter integration between secondary and tertiary musical study. Students and teachers will be encouraged to develop a transferable set of critical skills for analysing music in a comparative context, tools that will enable them to approach musical study at university level with greater confidence and flexibility. Students will hence be inspired to think about musical research (both practical and academic) in the HE sector in new ways, fostering a future generation of scholars, listeners and performers. 

Finally, the maintenance of a research blog throughout the year will enable performers, practitioners, students and members of the general public to comment on and feedback into the work-in-progress, as well as serving as a way of monitoring the project's milestones and gauging the success of the Fellowship's impact.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>158495</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A commercial recording by the Villiers Quartet of the original version of 'Late Swallows' from Delius's String Quartet (1916), using materials prepared by me during the course of my AHRC Leadership Fellowship, Delius, Modernism and the Sound of Place.</gtr:description><gtr:id>5FED7765-AF8E-4868-9AEE-98C84A624C9B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The recording has broadened the understanding and appreciation of Delius's work and its compositional genesis, and raised vital issues of performance and realisation which will be relevant to other interpretations of his music.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b16d808f2219.13949103</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>CD recording</gtr:title><gtr:type>Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2017</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>BBC Radio 3</gtr:department><gtr:description>Delius Sea-Drift</gtr:description><gtr:id>DCDC5648-1D16-4289-862D-CE2E9D5B01DF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The PI researched, wrote, and presented an edition of Radio 3's weekly Saturday morning Record Review slot, Building a Library, on Delius's Sea-Drift, his 1904 setting of Walt Whitman's poem 'Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking'.

This can involve not only understanding how music works, but connecting that information to what we know about a composer, the historical context of a work, and other music being written at the same time. This study-day, held on 18 March 2016 and aimed at Year 12, helped students to learn more about undergraduate analysis and music history, using the case-study of the English composer Frederick Delius and his orchestral work Brigg Fair. With the help of Oxford academics currently carrying out a research project on Delius, students were offered an informal lecture on the work and then carried out some of their own analysis. Lunch was provided at Merton College, along with a tour of the college and an admissions talk at the end of the day.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b06b8f34c286.29648890</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/open-days-outreach/events-students-teachers/year-12-music-study-day-delius</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>My work has already begun to generate significant impact. The discovery and editing of a hitherto unknown work by Delius, which had not been performed for 99 years, led to a major concert by the Villiers Quartet and an enhanced understanding of Delius's output and approach to the medium. This music has now been recorded for commercial release by Naxos in May 2017. In February 2016 I recorded an episode of BBC Radio 3's Building a Library on Sea-Drift, one of Delius's best known work, which directly draws on my research with the sources in the British Library and the Delius Trust. This was broadcast on 5 March and very warmly received. My research has furthered supported a study day for Sixth-Form students, held at Merton College, Oxford on 18 March 2016, exploring issues of authenticity, authorial intention, and interpretation. I chaired a further study day on performing Delius at the Royal Academy of Music on 18 May, in conjunction with the Delius Society, to which members of the public were invited. The day included presentations by Bo Holten, one of the leading Delius interpreters, as well as the fellowship's PI and RA. I also convened a 1-day seminar at the British Library in July 2016, with a range of speakers including Profs Peter Franklin and Jeremy Dibble and Dr Sarah Collins from the University of New South Wales. Held in conjunction with the BL and the Delius Society, the event was well attended and concluded with a dedicated recital of Delius's works and a pre-concert talk given by the PI. I have since given a further pre-concert talk on Delius's chamber works as part of the Park Lane Group's 2017 season at the Roayl Overseas League, which was very positively reviewed in the online journal Classical Source.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>2B1438B0-1EB5-4825-9E22-1A10F4E09FDE</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d18571e19213.40524058</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>My research has shed significant new light on the genesis, chronology, and reception of Frederick Delius's work, and also on issues of musical style and interpretation.
