The past ten years have witnessed a growth of interest in Asian and Asian American history. One manner in which this has been manifested is the proliferation of fictional, historical and autobiographical books about Asia, and aspects of Asian/American interaction, mostly published in America. In particular, a set of key Asian historical moments have latterly become the subject of intense American cultural scrutiny. These are: China's Cultural Revolution and its aftermath; the Korean American war and its legacy; the era of Japanese geisha culture and its subsequent decline; and China's one-child policy and the rise of transracial, international adoption in its wake. This book seeks to examine and account for this cultural and literary preoccupation and to explore the corresponding historical-political situations that have both circumscribed and enabled greater cultural and political contact between Asia and America. This attention may be neither positive nor welcome, and I also address the investments and issues at stake in these interests, both at local and transnational levels. Through a series of case study chapters, that deal in turn with American literary or life-writing representations of an aspect of China, Japan and Korea, four historical phenomena and four moments of unique transnational contact, are examined via a series of commercially successful and critically acclaimed narratives. In each case, the relationship between narrative and history is analysed in order to demonstrate a two-way interaction, whereby the texts themselves not only provide new and often alternative perspectives on each historical instance, but are also implicated in each cross-cultural encounter.\n\nEach historical example has also been chosen for the manner in which it has been largely under-addressed, intentionally suppressed, or misrepresented in either Asia or America. For instance, China's censorship of unflattering portraits of life under Communist rule is well-documented, and so it is only from the perspective and vantage point of being outside China that many books criticising China's regime have been possible. This is especially pertinent to historical accounts of the Cultural Revolution and its aftermath that have been published both in the United States and in Britain. The Chinese government's recent displeasure at Anglo-American criticism of its population policy and of the state of its orphanages provides a second example. In yet another case, geisha culture has traditionally been shrouded in secrecy, which may also account for the many myths and mysteries that surround it. It is only recently that the real, obscured, history of the geisha has been explored from the perspective of the West, as well as the contemporary life of Japan's remaining geishas. In my final example, I examine the combined effects of Korea's determination to forget its colonial era, the shame attached to memories of years of Japanese rule, and Japan's deliberate suppression of details about its occupation, as well as recent denials of comfort women's ordeals, that have all resulted in a lack of accounts about the decades of Japanese hegemony. Korean American historical narratives, seek to reverse this omission, and in so doing, to also specifically acknowledge the atrocities endured and the roles played by Korea's women during this period.\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-06-23</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>22367</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/F004737/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FB301405-099D-44B9-ADA9-75B11FDED8C0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>English Language &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
