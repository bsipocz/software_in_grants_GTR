excited molecules</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/J017973/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Understanding the chemistry of the atmosphere, combustion systems and technological plasmas is of great importance in the modern world. A very significant process in these gas-phase environments is the transfer of energy between molecules during collisions. The total amount of internal energy that a molecule possesses is important, but equally if not more important is what form that energy takes. It may be in the form of translational, rotational or vibrational motion of the molecule, or even in the arrangement of the electrons. A large amount of energy may be stored in a rearrangement of the electronic structure of a molecule, producing an electronically excited state. Such excited states occur in energetic environments such as combustion or plasmas, and their decay is what is responsible for the typically observed light emission. The excited states are often also created when molecules are probed in experiments using optical methods. The electronic energy may be re-radiated, but generally not before the molecule has undergone collisions with other gas-phase molecules. This may result in translational, rotational or vibrational energy transfer within the excited electronic state. Significantly, it may also involve either a reaction that removes the excited molecule altogether, or a quenching collision in which the electronic energy is lost to the collision partner.

Despite their importance, surprisingly little is known about the fundamental forces involved in collisions of electronically excited molecules. The best way to determine the detailed dynamics of the collisions of such molecules is using a technique called crossed molecular beam (CMB) scattering. In this method, defined beams of different molecules are collided in a vacuum chamber, and the details of their directions of travel and internal energies are observed in some fashion. We will extend this technique previously used for electronic ground state molecules to the collisions of electronically excited molecules, specifically NO, which is an important molecule in the atmosphere and combustion. We will build a new state-of-the-art CMB scattering apparatus, and by using a combination of laser pulses of different wavelengths will prepare NO molecules in their excited state. After these have collided with the target molecules we will probe the scattered molecules with a laser-based detection technique called velocity map ion-imaging, which is capable of accurately measuring their velocities. The laser pulse that prepares the excited NO defines a zero-time for the experiment, and so 'starts the clock' ticking. This will give us much better definition of the experiment than is usual in CMB experiments, and hence higher sensitivity to the scattering dynamics. We will use this sensitivity to study the collisions of NO with simple molecules relevant to combustion and the atmosphere, namely N2, O2 and CO. These are known to show very different quenching and reactive behaviours with excited NO, but little or nothing is known about the forces involved in these interactions. 

The results from our experiments will be used to deepen our understanding of what is important is directing energy transfer in electronically excited molecules, and will help to drive the development of better theoretical models and calculations, as well as providing information of direct relevance to scientist working in the combustion and atmospheric probing of NO.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed work is fundamental in nature and therefore it is expected that the societal and economic benefits deriving from the results will primarily be realised in the longer term. These specifically project-related benefits will follow from the improved understanding and capacity to model inelastic energy transfer and electronic quenching effects. These collisional processes are central to the behaviour of any gas-phase systems where energetic free radicals are present, initiated either by exothermic reactions or photolysis. The principal practical examples are the atmosphere, combustion, and technological plasmas. More accurate modelling and improved predictive capability will help to guide actions to mitigate the effects of undesirable atmospheric phenomena such as global warming or ozone destruction. They will similarly enable improved efficiency of combustion processes, with consequential economic benefits and reductions in environmental impact. The specific molecular target of the current research, NO, is one of the key species in both cases. Equally, one of the principal methods to determine trace-species concentrations and temperatures in the atmosphere or in combustion is optical probing based on various kinds of laser spectroscopy. Under the prevailing relatively high-pressure conditions, the relationship between signal strengths and species concentration is intimately dependent on collisional energy-transfer processes of the type whose mechanisms are to be investigated here. The improved understanding will enhance the accuracy and hence the value of the information derived from such optically based diagnostics.

There will, in addition, be more immediate impact from the output of highly trained personnel with technical skills in the use of modern laser, vacuum, electronic-data capture and data processing technologies. They will also have well-developed generic and transferable communication, presentation and problem-solving skills. They will be ideally suited to contribute to the growth or creation of high-technology companies, enhancing innovative capacity and consequently increasing business revenues.

We will also continue to enhance public awareness of science by disseminating the aims and results of this work to the wider public, at a suitable level, through available media including lectures, on-line video presentations and websites.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-08-05</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-08-06</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>540750</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Sandia Laboratories</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Experiment - Dave Chandler</gtr:description><gtr:id>112EB025-9C6E-4DB8-BD47-C406AA7CF003</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Steill et al.

Understanding what happens in their collisions with other molecules and atoms is a vital part of being able to predict and model the chemical and physical evolution of these environments. This includes inelastic collisions, ones in which no chemical reaction occurs, but in which energy is transferred e.g. from translational motion of the molecules into rotational motion. This project has developed a new experimental apparatus to make precise and highly detailed measurements of inelastic collisions. In a unique step, the radical studied, nitric oxide (NO), is electronically excited, by absorption of a ultraviolet photon, before the collision occurs. The excited NO is produced in a molecular beam, travelling in a well-defined initial direction, and collided with another molecular beam of a chosen atom (e.g. Helium, Neon or Argon) or molecule (e.g. Nitrogen, Oxygen, Carbon Monoxide). The NO is rotationally excited in the collision, and these products are probed using high-resolution laser spectroscopy, in which the NO is ionized. The NO+ cations resulting can be accelerated by electric fields to a detector, in a process called velocity-map imaging. This enables us to measure their velocity (speed and direction of travel) after collision By choosing the polarization of the probe light, we can also measure how the plane of rotation of the NO relates to its velocity. Both of these properties are very sensitive probes of the forces acting between the NO and its collision partner, which may be independently calculated by theoretical methods.
 Using this newly designed and constructed apparatus, we have made the first-ever systematic measurements of the dynamics of the collisions of electronically excited NO with both rare gases (He, Ne and Ar), and molecules (D2 and N2). We have been able to compare these measurements to the results predicted by theory, and have been able to confirm where theory is right, and to show where it is currently inaccurate. In addition, we have been able to make predictions about the specific failings of the current theoretical models (e.g. with Ne), and to provide predictions for theory to test for systems which have not yet been the subject of calculations (e.g. D2 and N2). These results will stimulate new theoretical studies, and should help to improve not just the calculation of these particular systems, but also related systems featuring other small radical species, e.g. OH, NH, CH. During the course of the project, we have trained a PDRA from post-PhD to an experienced position, one PhD student has been supervised to thesis submission. We have developed and maintained an active collaboration with two world-leading research groupings in experiment and theory in the USA.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This is a pure research project, and as such, our findings from it are generally of benefit to the academic community. Our findings are relevant to both experimentalists and theoreticians. They are directly relevant to those working in the same field on inelastic and reactive collisions of small molecules. They demonstrate for the first time that it is possible to perform such measurements on electronically excited molecules, opening up a wide range of new molecular systems for study. Our results have also directly challenged some of the more widely used models of product rotational angular momentum, demonstrating that these models are not universally applicable. The results test specific details of the energy of interaction of excited NO with rare gases, previously calculated by ab initio electronic structure calculations. This provides new challenges for ab initio theory on this system, and will inform calculations on related excited state systems. We also hope that the availability of high quality experimental information on the interaction of excited NO with small molecules (e.g. D2) will encourage high-level electronic structure calculations on these systems. More widely, our measurements and their tests of theory are relevant to anybody modelling electronically excited NO in gas-phase environments, e.g. combustion, the atmosphere, technological plasmas.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>755BDCBC-4A86-42CD-A558-3CE5F4BE2DBA</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d9cecb6a4863.80432739</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Education,Energy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://dynamics.eps.hw.ac.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2B98D834-2DCA-453D-AB26-60855D22B82B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Comparative stereodynamics in molecule-atom and molecule-molecule rotational energy transfer: NO(A(2)S(+)) + He and D2.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Journal of chemical physics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/20f4dcce561631b2e63588d1f46574ea"><gtr:id>20f4dcce561631b2e63588d1f46574ea</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Luxford TF</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0021-9606</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5811aa428cc2d2.05224265</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A0A6D146-265D-4CAA-BA82-9E635DCF5A2B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Experimental testing of ab initio potential energy surfaces: Stereodynamics of NO(AS) + Ne inelastic scattering at multiple collision energies.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Journal of chemical physics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/20f4dcce561631b2e63588d1f46574ea"><gtr:id>20f4dcce561631b2e63588d1f46574ea</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Luxford TF</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0021-9606</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5898be0c916a12.95712599</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B987C142-6208-4AB4-8D95-FE8D109B1E2D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Rotational alignment of NO (A2S+) from collisions with Ne.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The journal of physical chemistry.
