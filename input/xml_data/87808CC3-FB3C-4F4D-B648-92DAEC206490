Eastern Germany's fast-changing landscape of monuments and memorials is central to the shaping of collective identities and memories, particularly in light of Germany's two twentieth century dictatorships. While much research has hitherto been carried out on memorials relating to the Holocaust and the National Socialist past, there has been very little detailed work on the way in which the German Democratic Republic (GDR) and the legacy of socialism feature within this landscape - despite extensive historical research on the GDR, as well as a number of recent works on 'Ostalgie' and manifestations of east German identities in literature, film and consumer culture. \n\nThe proposed project aims to fill this gap by producing a monograph which will examine a selection of in-depth case studies of monuments and memorials in eastern Germany. The focus on the urban landscape is particularly significant on the territory of former East Germany, for the GDR regime placed great importance on monuments and urban space in order to promote a collective socialist consciousness and a cohesive East German identity. In contrast to numerous recent studies of non-spatial 'sites of memory', the focus of this project returns to the principal physical meaning of the term 'site', underlining the primary importance of the relationship between the built environment and memory. As a focused study of lesser-known monuments relating to key events and themes in the GDR (e.g. socialist icons, Soviet special camps, 17 June 1953, the Berlin Wall and the events of 1989/90), it will be the first of its kind in the field, and will move away from the well-documented focus on national narratives in Berlin. The key areas of investigation relate to four areas: \n\na) the role of the GDR past in shaping both the physical landscape of eastern Germany and the construction of national and regional identities; \nb) the agents of memory and the identification of key patterns in the memorialisation process;\nc) the relationship between time and memory, in order to test the categorisation of different 'types' of memory and to assess the impact of past memory cultures on present structures of memory;\nd) the restrictions and challenges of memorial form and the impact of form, location and authenticity on the production of memory. \n\nIn order to investigate these issues, the project will 'read' the selected monuments and associated debates in three ways. First, it will test the motives of key interest groups by examining documentary records from the planning stages of monuments; second, it will examine the reception and understanding of monuments through local newspaper coverage, the activities of citizens' groups, and the observation of public interaction with the monuments; third, it will investigate the interplay between conflicting types of collective memories through interviews with artists, local activists and politicians. These methods will ensure that case studies are examined from the perspectives of both the participants and the institutions/groups which are responsible for creating the monuments, thus highlighting the interaction between 'top down' and 'bottom up' memories.\n\nThis project is a timely investigation of memorialisation processes in contemporary Germany, for it will be able to reflect on the twentieth anniversary celebrations of the fall of the Berlin Wall and of unification, both of which have significantly shaped the narratives within which memorial structures are embedded. It is also a significant time to build on public interest in this sphere, as is the aim of the broader impact of this project, which intends to engage teachers and learners of Germanand contemporary history, as well as practioners in the field of public art.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In addition to the production of a monograph and the presentation of a conference paper, this project will produce three further outputs which aim to engage with beneficiaries outside of the academic research community: \n\n1. Schools workshops\nMaterials relating to the question of monuments and memorials in Germany will be worked into a series of workshop sessions, which will be offered to local secondary schools and language-learning events after the Fellowship period. The primary aim of the workshops will be to encourage language-learning in an interdisciplinary environment in order to demonstrate the practical application of languages, but also to encourage students to learn about the socialist past and to promote creative thinking through the practical design of monuments. The workshops will comprise three elements, relating to a) the German language and our understanding of memory, b) the examination of a monument case study and its history, c) a practical session on monument design. \n\n2. Website with workshop materials for teachers/language associations\nA website will make workshop materials available to teachers and language associations; it will also profile case studies, feature a variety of visual materials as well as a brief history of the monuments and their associated debates. These materials will be of benefit to: a) teachers of German and history, b) student 'Language Ambassadors' in universities, c) German language and cultural associations, such as the Goethe Institute, the German Academic Exchange service (DAAD) and the Association for Modern German Studies (AMGS), and d) bodies seeking to promote language-learning, such as the National Centre for Languages (CILT) and the British Council. The 'Routes into Languages' scheme will be a prime platform for publicising the website and workshops. The website will also encourage feedback from teachers and organisations, and will profile a selection of pupils' own monument designs at workshops - thus promoting their own work and encouraging other learners to engage with the project.\n\n3. Article for 'kunststadt-stadtkunst'\nSubmission of an article in German to kunststadt-stadtkunst, the annual publication of the Berufsverband Bildender K&amp;uuml;nstler Berlins (BBK), which profiles theoretical debates concerning art in the public sphere, in particular the interrelationship between art and memory. My article will summarise the main findings of my project, elucidating particularly those elements relating to form and memory. As a magazine of interest to professional artists and those practicing in the field of public art, this will enable the communication of my research to a wider target audience. \n\nThese outputs will build on existing links at Bangor with local schools, CILT Cymru and other intermediary organisations such as the DAAD, the British Council, the Goethe Institute and the AMGS, thus facilitating the dissemination of materials and the publication of the website. Having conducted a period of primary research at the BBK in 2007, I have already informally been invited to contribute to one of their publications. \n\nI have extensive experience of editing and managing web-pages. The website will be hosted on Bangor University web server, and the Bangor web-team will help with the initial creation of the site and provide ongoing support. My experience of previous schools' workshops, as well as teaching a number of undergraduate and postgraduate modules on East Germany and structures of memory will provide a firm basis for the preparation of workshop materials. Student 'Language Ambassadors' who work in schools will also have received specific training under the 'Routes into Languages' scheme.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>55893</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>'Memorialising 1989': Invited paper (Nottingham Trent)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5EC117CA-A060-4140-BCDC-F9A0E19E45C9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited paper given at Nottingham Trent University, to the 'History and Heritage Group', on the invitation of Prof. Bill Niven, 21 February 2012. Title of paper: 'Memorialising 1989 in eastern Germany: The growth of the participatory monument?' By examining the biographies of a selection of regional monuments to 1989 - often funded through public donations - this paper investigated a number of questions relating to the memory dynamics of 1989. In particular it examined recent attempts to move away from the concept of the 'counter-monument' and suggested the rise of the 'participatory monument' in the eastern German regions. There was fruitful debate on this concept afterwards.

Debate on concepts such as the 'counter-monument' and the 'participatory monument' provided further insight into memory of the GDR and memorial aesthetics amongst those present. Given that many of the audience were not specialists in German history, one notable impact was the raising of awareness of questions of memory and identity in post-unification Germany.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-1357690339.30980630c1346d4</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academic audiences (collaborators, peers etc.)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Schools Workshop (Highgate School)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3C696C4A-1B47-48A9-B75D-F5940B542B47</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Approximately 35 A-level students and teachers of German attended an afternoon event on the Berlin Wall at Highgate School in London (other attending schools were: Mill Hill, UCS, Abingdon and North London Collegiate).

They consisted of three parts: 1) discussion of German-language terms for monuments and acts of remembrance; discussion of the purpose of monuments and memorials; presentation of a number of case studies of contemporary monuments in rememberance of both the Holocaust and the GDR; 2) group-work to create a monument to a specific event in contemporary German history; 3) presentation of group work and discussion of the benefits and drawbacks of the proposals. The workshop aimed to advance students' working vocabulary in German, enhance their knowledge of contemporary German history and develop an awareness of the challenges facing town planners, historians and artists in Berlin.

Questionnaire results revealed that students particularly engaged with and benefitted from the monument workshops. Several commented on the fact that they had learned a great deal about contemporary German history, and results showed an increased interest in learning German after the workshop.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-2981323099.67775150c15d714</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2012,2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>'Wir sind das Volk': Invited paper (Birmingham)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>758AA7C6-FBA0-4898-9512-B101098DDE87</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This invited paper was entitled '&amp;quot;Wir sind das Volk&amp;quot;: 1989 and East German Memorials', and formed part of a seminar series co-hosted by the Institute for Germanic Studies and the Department of Modern Languages, University of Birmingham, 12 February 2014.

The Masterclasses are designed for A-level teachers of German, in order to provide them with background knowledge and resources on GDR history and culture, which they can then use in the classroom with their own pupils. There was enthusiastic discussion throughout all four days, and teachers commented on the useful opportunity to share good practice and teaching ideas. Questionnaires from all four days provided exceptionally positive feedback.




Teachers commented on the useful nature of the sessions and resources, and reported renewed enthusiasm for teaching this area of German history/culture.

The key findings fall into four main areas: 

1) POST-UNIFICATION REPRESENTATIONS OF THE GDR

The physical presence of the GDR past in the urban landscape - whether aesthetically unpopular or politically contested - continues to play a significant role in the negotiation of united German identities. While Cold War narratives still persist in some areas, public memories of the GDR are also diversifying, in recognition of the fact that the socialist state was experienced in manifold ways. Significantly, the traditional categorisation of 'victims' and 'perpetrators' frequently proves to be misleading, and the biographies of many monuments suggest the need for a more nuanced understanding of this past. 

2) RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CENTRE AND THE PERIPHERY

The complex and dynamic interplay of regional and national constructions of identity through monument projects suggest differences in the motivations for, and forms of, public commemoration in Berlin and the regions. In Berlin, where a new united Germany is symbolically being created, mnemonic symbolism often adopts heightened form and is debated more controversially than elsewhere. In the regions, however, monuments are commonly invested with stronger group identities and result from greater grass-roots activity. Many such monuments have arisen from a sense of competition with Berlin, and a desire to revise centralised historical narratives. As such, Berlin often represents a mnemonic anomaly - a reminder that we must look beyond the capital in order to gauge any sense of 'collective' memories of the GDR.

3) RESTRICTIONS AND CHALLENGES OF MEMORIAL FORM

The demands of concision and the language of visual signification condition the types of memories that are generated through monuments. Although traditional designs continue to be constructed, a clear trend exists towards more experimental and transitory forms, many of which attempt to provoke the active experience of memory, and thus allow for the fluidity and temporality of identities. Although such new forms - often dubbed Denkzeichen ('memory markers') - bear formal similarities with 'counter-monuments' dedicated to Holocaust remembrance, their open-endedness is most commonly a reaction against the prescriptive symbolism of GDR times, as well as a response to the proximity - and as such 'unfinished' nature - of GDR history, which still remains open to much discussion. 

4) RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TIME AND MEMORY

This project demonstrates that cultural memory does not necessarily succeed communicative memory, but that the two commonly co-exist and commingle. Moreover, as the case of GDR-related monuments suggests, a more important temporal phenomenon is the dialogic quality of memory, in which contemporary monuments respond as much to past traditions of remembrance (e.g. Holocaust memorials, GDR monuments, western modes of remembrance) as to the very past in question. Indeed, monuments exist as links in a reactive chain, in which different memories compete or respond to others, thus becoming part of a self-perpetuating cycle. As such, it could be suggested that the 'memory industry' is not yet coming to an end - as claimed by some scholars - but rather adopting new forms.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings of this research will be of interest to practitioners in the areas of commemoration and memorialisation (e.g. artists, town planners, local governments) as well as to interest groups involved in the creation or protection of monuments.
