Nevertheless, recent advances in this area have established metallopolymers as an attractive class of easily processed materials in which metal centres introduce properties and functions that complement those available with state-of-the-art organic macromolecules. This proposal outlines a research programme to synthetically develop and to understand the properties of two new classes of metallopolymers based on the metals cobalt and nickel, and also to lay the foundations for their exploitation, with a particular focus on their antimicrobial and magnetic properties. The development of new antibiotics is of key global importance due to the reduced effectiveness of currently available compounds towards infection. In addition, the development of easily processed polymeric materials that function as magnets is particularly desirable for a range of applications in computers and other devices.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In addition to the anticipated academic impact at the international level (see Academic Beneficiaries section), the proposed project is designed to have broader significance.

Building on the more fundamental and exploratory work proposed over the first 1.5 years of the project, which is vital for the synthetic development and characterisation of the new Co and Ni metallopolymers, two areas of potential application are targeted.

First, the proposed research programme seeks to develop new cobalt-containing polymeric materials, which have prospective applications in medicine by virtue of their potential antimicrobial properties. Bacteria are becoming increasingly resistant to the range of antibiotics that are currently available and this serves to jeopardise the quality-of-life in the UK, as once curable illnesses will become unresponsive to treatment. The development of new antibiotics, or the reduction of bacterial resistance to existing medicines, therefore has potential for substantial societal impact. Developments in this area will also potentially have an economic impact on the UK with the pharmaceutical industry best placed to benefit. This would subsequently be anticipated to lead to growth in associated support industries, such as fine chemicals and product testing. The growth in antibiotic resistant bacteria is a global problem and is not restricted to the UK. It is therefore most likely that reversing this trend could lead to further investment in UK pharmaceutical R&amp;amp;D, and growth in related exports. Both of these effects should add to the positive impact on the UK economy arising from this advance.

Second, the proposed research programme targets the development of new nickel- and cobalt-containing polymers that are magnetic, and may ultimately be used in data storage applications. Advances in this field are, in part, key to improving the performance of current computer technologies, and should also enable further miniaturisation of components. Magnet materials also have many other applications from compasses to credit cards. The application of metallopolymers to the preparation of magnetic materials is expected to result in simpler device fabrication by means of low-cost polymer processing routes. These approaches should also be operable at low temperature, thus reducing the energy input and carbon footprint relative to existing technologies. The ubiquity of computers and other applications of magnets in modern life means that significant societal and economic benefits can be envisaged through advances in this area. This is especially true for social impact, if progress leads to smaller and cheaper devices. Manufacturers of high-tech memory elements should expect to be the primary economic beneficiaries, and a growth in jobs related to this industry should result. Furthermore, the size and global nature of the end-user community for computer memory would suggest that significant R&amp;amp;D investment to the UK should also be forthcoming.

Highly trained scientists that can contribute to the UK economy through the commercial sector are a crucial resource. In addition to the new scientific results that this project will generate, the training of a new PDRA as an interdisciplinary scientist will represent an important contribution to the UK workforce.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>263682</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D87FEB1A-72B7-4B56-B660-8DD95AD0A6A9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Main-chain metallopolymers at the static-dynamic boundary based on nickelocene</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nature Chemistry</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d9551fb08c016fb936ebc67997dc78a2"><gtr:id>d9551fb08c016fb936ebc67997dc78a2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Musgrave R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a969f2b096fb0.48553223</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/N030702/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
