Research has shown that stress can have an effect on enzymes that are important for the normal healing of wounds. Diabetic patients are prone to foot wounds that can take months or years to heal. As diabetic patients have been shown to experience high levels of distress this project is interested in whether this distress contributes to problems with healing. We will directly measure levels of enzymes relevant to healing in the wounds and see whether this is related to how much psychological distress is reported by the patients and the levels of the stress hormone cortisol in their saliva. This may mean that our findings are able to explain how psychological factors can have an impact on physiological problems. Such a finding would be important for the type of care given to this group of patients as their mental health may be crucial to their physical health which may mean the provision of psychological help in conjunction with usual care. Such an intervention could result in improved healing rates and lower levels of distress in people with diabetes.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>High levels of distress are commonplace in diabetic patients and there is now good evidence that stress negatively affects wound-healing in both healthy and clinical populations. As part of an MRC funded project on Psychological and Social Predictors of Wound Healing, diabetic patients attending with a new ulcer were recruited from outpatient podiatry clinics in secondary care (n=60). Patients underwent assessments of ulcer size, glucose control and psychological distress over a 24-week period. Wound fluid and saliva samples were also taken routinely. The emerging results of this study indicate a relationship between psychological distress and wound healing; it is therefore the intention of the proposed project to explore potential biological mediators. It has been shown that, in acute wounds, stress is associated with altered expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs: enzymes required for extra-cellular matrix (ECM) remodelling) and that the hormone cortisol is associated with downregulation in some classes of these enzymes. However, the issue of how stress impacts on the expression of these enzymes in chronic wounds and the clinical relevance of any stress-related alterations has yet to be explored. The objectives of the present study are, therefore:
1. To extend existing findings concerning stress and MMP expression in acute wounds, by examining the contribution of distress to the expression of MMPs at the wound site in diabetic foot ulcers.
2. To explore the relationship between distress, MMP expression and healing rates in diabetic foot ulcers.
3. To examine the association between distress, ulcer healing and fluctuations in salivary cortisol (an indicator of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function).
Wound fluid will be assayed to measure MMP-2 (a marker of ECM remodelling and repair) and MMP-9 (a marker of inflammation). These measurements will be analysed in the context of ulcer healing rates, glucose control and psychological distress. The release of cortisol is controlled by the HPA axis, the neuroendocrine element of the stress response and an immune mediator. This will therefore allow us to explore potential mechanisms for the apparent effects of psychological distress on wound healing. This research would represent a significant contribution to the literature concerning the effects of psychosocial variables on chronic disease outcomes and would also be highly informative to the formation of health policy as the results may have implications for health care delivery in this patient group.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>143405</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Cafe Scientifique.

There was a lively discussion after based on the concept of the role of stress in health.

Feedback was excellent. Teachers reported that widened students' horizons and that they were encouraged to think about research as a career. It raised the profile of the subject and was used by the school to generate publicity. The Head of Biology at the school asked me to return for another project next year, and I was approached to give a Cafe Scientifique talk later in the year.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>jHiEj7YLj9h</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2011</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>CF51361D-1FB1-458F-B55D-A223F5AD9FC9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Illness beliefs predict self-care behaviours in patients with diabetic foot ulcers: a prospective study.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Diabetes research and clinical practice</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/18048de9105a471ffe9688102e7a25ca"><gtr:id>18048de9105a471ffe9688102e7a25ca</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Vedhara K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0168-8227</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56dd5bb5e615c3.51788332</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2066CA61-6B2D-486F-872D-CC16BFFBA7DF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Illness Beliefs Predict Mortality in Patients with Diabetic Foot Ulcers.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>PloS one</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/18048de9105a471ffe9688102e7a25ca"><gtr:id>18048de9105a471ffe9688102e7a25ca</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Vedhara K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1932-6203</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58b6a877bbbd61.49149831</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>28A81BCB-A4FF-4554-8FE4-364DDA6D1AA9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Coping style and depression influence the healing of diabetic foot ulcers: observational and mechanistic evidence.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Diabetologia</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/18048de9105a471ffe9688102e7a25ca"><gtr:id>18048de9105a471ffe9688102e7a25ca</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Vedhara K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0012-186X</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>mBaRDuf1Jod</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1ED93B5D-17A7-4C10-B204-A9F3B86BD707</gtr:id><gtr:title>Stress, Illness Perceptions, Behaviors, and Healing in Venous Leg Ulcers: Findings From a Prospective Observational Study.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Psychosomatic medicine</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c19fd8361f43ff77944b1bc8187dedd6"><gtr:id>c19fd8361f43ff77944b1bc8187dedd6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Walburn J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0033-3174</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58b6a877915859.29000417</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>33A3AD17-C724-4254-A083-5DF994AE5184</gtr:id><gtr:title>The effects of perceived stress on biological parameters in healthcare professionals: A systematic review.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of health psychology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8c97558c47b9a5651bc63ee6b1a78b6a"><gtr:id>8c97558c47b9a5651bc63ee6b1a78b6a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dawe K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1359-1053</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56dd5bb6167993.58028672</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">G0800047</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>160D22D0-5677-4513-A0AC-7F3526B7F336</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Metabolic and Endocrine</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>2472941E-25F2-45EC-A735-3C0872CE6B26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.3  Psychological, social and economic factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
