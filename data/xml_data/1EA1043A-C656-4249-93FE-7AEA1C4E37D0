1. Create a new innovation curriculum at the creative and digital economy incubator Brighton Fusebox developed out of the Brighton Fuse Project. The curriculum will be directly informed by the main findings of that project which are that arts, humanities and design knowledge and expertise are major drivers in businesses in the Brighton creative and digital cluster. The development of the innovation curriculum will involve a new kind of knowledge exchange research connecting academic approaches to learning with entrepreneurial business strategies aimed at creating value. The work will involve academics observing and engaging in a range of ways in the day to day operations of the Fusebox and will include crowd sourced ideas generation, interviews and workshops with its members. The new curriculum can be applied in other incubator and related contexts but can also inform curriculum developments within arts and humanities education and research. The research represents a practical and applied way of exploring innovation, how it happens, and where academic expertise and insights can be instrumental in creating business value. Its knowledge exchange approach recognizes the importance of the cross-flow of insights from the new creative and digital business sector into the academy to enhance arts and humanities researchers' awareness of the importance and roles of their work in economy and society and different forms of creativity aimed at creating value within them. The informal, flexible and continuous learning enabled by the new economy are strong elements that can feed back into arts and humanities orientations and practices from the entrepreneurial work and culture of the Fusebox. The knowledge exchange approach will seek to mirror the peer to peer emphasis, experiential and playful dimensions of the creative and digital economy as a new environment for production and consumption as well as learning. In this way the new knowledge generated by the project is anticipated to potentially inform theory and practice in the academy as much as in the market place.
2. Produce a commentary on developing effective models for engagement between the FuseBox and Higher Education including a critical analysis of current knowledge exchange approaches and reflections on how AHRC activities (research, hubs, events, etc) can more effectively support successful business activities in the SME creative and digital economy sector. This will enable those operating within and across the academy and business to see more clearly how arts and humanities are supporting and driving the creative and digital economy. 
3. Prepare a report on the FuseBox for the AHRC which compliments and enhances the work of the Brighton Fuse project to develop understanding of the fusion of knowledge, skills and capabilities that creative businesses need in a fast changing digital economy and the role of arts and humanities research collaborations in supporting and developing this. Outputs from the project will aim to fuse arts and humanities and innovative business knowledge and skill sets and will generate new or adapted concepts and language reflecting such fusion to feed into current debates about digital literacy relevant to wider focus on innovation not only in Research Councils UK but also key agencies such as the Technology Strategy Board. This focus addresses the transition from an industrial to a creative and digital economy and new understandings of the material world in networked intelligent and big data contexts. Outputs from the project will link to this focus and illustrate how arts and humanities perspectives feed into thinking about the Internet of Everything and the social and cultural transformations it entails.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-04-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-02-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>78798</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Wired Sussex</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Arts and Design and Digital Innovation</gtr:description><gtr:id>C288F7C1-179A-440D-9632-8B8F1FA1C703</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Multidisciplinary: arts, design, humanities, digital economy</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5460aafa3b4260.93970100-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Knowledge exchange of business expertise and access to start-up incubator setting and working practices.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Knowledge exchange on digital economy and innovation with diverse inputs to the co-design and launch of a new business development programme for start-up innovators at Wired Sussex using Arts and Design approaches and tools and researching the power of their fusion with digital innovation.

- Creating new businesses. Starting with a group of participants with ideas and supporting their development as innovators, resulting in 10 businesses emerging.
- Establishing a radical new model of business support that embeds creative arts and design thinking in innovators to make them robust and sustainable.
- Building an innovation toolkit that can be applied in other contexts.
The research findings based on the feedback from the innovators on the experience and value of the 24-week programme to them and their business development showed impact in four main ways:
1. The value of collaboration in accelerating innovator and business development grows for individuals as creative arts and design approaches and tools help them to access and benefit from it.
2. Capacities for innovators to make the most of a collaborative innovative space such as the FuseBox at Wired Sussex are dependent on tools that facilitate different ways of working together.
3. Collaborative work to accelerate the creative transformation of ideas is valued more highly by innovators than protection of their individual ideas. 
4. Customer focus is enhanced by a dual learning process which simultaneously concentrates on the inside (innovator development) and the outside (the market).
The business outcomes from FuseBox24 were in three main areas:
- Proof of concept and taking a product to market.
- Collaborations among participants.
- Recruitment.
1. Proof of concept and taking a product to market: 
- Loop.coop launched their first product, Looptopia, at an event within the Brighton Digital Festival, which was a sell-out at the FuseBox.
- Hexology launched their first online/offline engagement campaign during the Brighton Digital Festival.
- MakerClub were awarded a feasibility grant of &amp;pound;76,000 by Innovate UK and also raised an additional &amp;pound;10,000 via Indiegogo crowd-funding.
2. Collaborations among participants:
- The Spark Festival was devised and run by MakerClub and Long Run Communications.
- Collide Hackathon (Long Run Communications, Adam Gill).
- Sustain Debate (Brighton Fashion Week and Long Run Communications).
3. Recruitment:
- 50% of the businesses hired people, including through the Wired Sussex intern programme - Adam Gill Projects, CrowCreation, Loop.coop, MakerClub and Metta Eggs.
These outcomes relating to the business ideas and propositions ran alongside journeys leading to significant personal and innovator development reported in detail by participants as part of the research findings.
Research-Innovation model
The new research-innovation model developed by the project had three main impacts:
1. By integrating research into the business support programme from the outset it meant that the innovation-oriented processes were infused with dynamic forms of academic engagement including reflection, critique and analysis. Participants were partners in research as much as practice and were engaged on that basis, right from the interview for participation stage through to the final showcase event, where the businesses presented their success stories alongside the presentation of the research findings and the final FuseBox24 report.
2. The development of a toolbox representing a fusion of business, technological and creative arts and design approaches, accessible to a wide audience of users in business and other sectors, and open to pop-up use and adaptation.
3. The production of a 60-page final report, FuseBox24, combining the key research findings and evidence from the project alongside the business stories, written in an accessible form, and aimed at a wide audience in business, policy, public and third sector as well as research and education more broadly. This was accompanied by a two-page evidence briefing and a short film offering an overview and key points. All material including presentations and films from the closing showcase event were posted online with details disseminated through business, policy and research networks. The report has led to national and international invitations to share the findings with research, policy, economic development, arts, creative and local authority sector organizations among others.
At a broader level in terms of the longer-term impact of the research-innovation model, mentoring and collaborative relationships have continued to develop with businesses from the programme involving the PI and other colleagues at the University of Brighton. This has also linked to the work of Innovate UK's Digital Catapult Centre Brighton launched in early 2015. These longer term links, which include funding bid work, signal the model's impact in bringing research closer to market in fresh and sustainable ways by breaking down barriers between the academy and business and making research resources more flexibly accessible to businesses.
In relation to an EPSRC blog on the FuseBox24 project in 2015 Simon Riley told the PI: 'FuseBox24 has had nothing less than a monumental impact on our business. Upon entering the programme, we were offered business advice and challenged on our business model in a number of ways, and we continue to think in terms of lean canvas and iterative development. One of our core tenets at MakerClub is that electronics and programming should be taught in conjunction with creativity and craft, a belief taken directly from the Fuse ethos. Without help from those directly involved in FuseBox24 as well as the network we have met as a result, I am sure we would not have been successful winning over &amp;pound;100k worth of grants during the last year.' MakerClub were winners of the UK Creative Business Cup 2015.
Also at the broader level since 2015 as a result of the research findings, I have been invited to contribute to diverse policy and funding processes including at European level related to innovation and next generation internet (NGI) and the role of creative arts and design. NGI involves key technologies such as virtual and augmented reality, AI and robotics, and the Internet of Things. In 2017 the research findings are also feeding into debates around the creative industries and creative and digital economy and the government's new industrial strategy.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>B18D0CA1-073E-43C4-8530-6AF1D40D5778</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56e01d8ef35234.61907712</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>FuseBox24 has broken new ground and taken the fusion principle of the earlier Brighton Fuse research forward in three key areas:
- A people-centred model adapted to innovation in the CDIT sector focused on innovators, customers and a new fused form of creative arts, business and technology support. 
- Designation of a live lab (FuseBox) as a creative and maker space as much as a tech one with activities emphasising flows across these different ways of experimenting with, thinking through and testing business propositions.
- A ToolBox of tested strategies fusing creative arts, technology and business approaches which can easily and flexibly be adopted and adapted in other contexts to support innovators of different kinds.
FuseBox24's focus was research on innovators, with innovators, for innovators.
The FuseBox24 project found that CDIT innovators:
- Trade in ideas and content, but tend not to worry about protecting intellectual property - open innovation and collaborative approaches dominate.
- Often as sole traders or micro-businesses need shared spaces in which to collaborate with others to develop ideas. 
- Need support, capability and new tools to enable them to get the most out of collaborations for sustainable innovation.
The Fusebox24 findings demonstrated that arts, humanities and design approaches are highly effective in meeting these needs.
Policy relevance and implications for accelerated innovation
The dual power of collaborative and individual development in achieving business and customer focus and clarity in innovators needs to be prioritized in skills and education as well as business support arenas. Local Economic Partnerships (LEPs), Sector Skills Councils (SSCs), Further Education (FE) and Higher Education (HE) all have roles to play here.
- support for innovation needs to take more account of the importance of aiding time and space for experimental collaborative work to help create robust and sustainable innovators. 
- while funding and support often focus firmly on individual innovations themselves, more attention should be given to supporting the collaborative development of the fused individuals who can sustainably and flexibly innovate and innovate again.
Live labs to develop fused innovators
New kinds of incubator live lab space and innovator support programmes shaped by creative arts, business and technology fusion are needed. Priorities should include:
- Open innovator live labs which facilitate seamless and diverse forms of individual and collaborative work and mentoring, while representing an identifiable collective space where different kinds of creative and business-development group activity take place.
- The designation of the lab as a creative and maker space as much as a tech one with activities emphasising flows across these different ways of experimenting with, thinking through and testing propositions.
- Diverse arts, humanities and design inputs and perspectives as embedded elements of the business development work as well as features of the lab space itself.
ToolBox24
The FuseBox24 programme has produced a ToolBox of tested strategies fusing creative arts, technology and business approaches which can easily be adopted and adapted in other contexts to support innovators of different kinds.
- Toolbox approaches are accessible, flexible, mobile and geared towards open innovation so represent a technique with wide applicability in digital transformations across business and society.
- Pop-up innovation can be considered a radical notion and ToolBox24 offers resources for all kinds of businesses and institutions to think differently about how they support and further innovative practices and, equally importantly, make them more inclusive and open.
Research-innovation model
The Fusebox24 research-innovation model demonstrates that research needs to be repositioned as an integral part of new paths towards accelerated CDIT development. This means more experimentation in where and how research takes place and greater orientation to and opportunity for co-creation with artistic, business and technological practice.
- Building in the research component as foundational to innovation work in creative and digital economy ensures that systematic findings can be made available to wider audiences in education and all sectors of the economy, public and private, which are undergoing or will need to undergo continuous change in the CDIT era.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The FuseBox24 findings provide a basis and rationale for further research on creative arts and design methods as drivers of sustainable innovation and the development of innovators. The findings contribute to a case for new research on the economic value of arts and design beyond traditional creative industries models, in other words for their wider impact in creative and digital economy.

In practice the FuseBox 24 toolbox of methods has been captured and presented in an accessible way so that researchers, innovators in for profit and non profit organizations, as well as many others, can apply and adapt them for thier own innovation needs. This model also signals best practice in making research results impactful in wide contexts.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4892F142-3998-43E9-895F-D1358005FF55</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dff8f3752097.47869518</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social
