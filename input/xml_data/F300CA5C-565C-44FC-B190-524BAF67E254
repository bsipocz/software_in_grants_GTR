Consolidation of previous work:
I was able to complete my work on the International Fertility Decision Making Study with the publication of a paper assessing fertility knowledge and beliefs about fertility treatment in a sample of 10,045 women and men trying to get pregnant from 79 countries. Completion of this project provided me with experience of managing a large-scale multi-country research project and dataset. I developed collaborations with two European research groups (Belgium, Greece) working on replication studies of a tool I developed during my PhD (Factors Affecting Fertility Scale: Bunting and Boivin, 2008). This work has resulted (so far) in the preparation of two publications (van Asseldonk, D'Hooghe, Bunting, Mol, Repping, Boivin, Dancet; Papaharitou and Bunting). 

Evaluation and dissemination of the FertiSTAT:
During my PhD I developed a free self-administered tool to raise awareness about the factors that affect female fertility. The Fertility Status Awareness Tool (FertiSTAT) provides women with personalised risk information and guidance about their fertility. To develop the FertiSTAT I conducted a comprehensive review of the literature and a mini-delphi round with reproductive experts to select the 21 evidence-based risk factors used in the tool and published a preliminary cross-sectional validation of the FertiSTAT in a pregnant and infertile sample (Bunting and Boivin, 2010). 
The fellowship funding has provided me with the opportunity to continue the development of the FertiSTAT in the following ways:
- FertiSTAT collaborations. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has adopted the FertiSTAT to use in low-resource countries as a primary assessment tool. The tool is currently being adapted for low-literacy and cross-country use (using pictures to replace text) to be used as a front-line medical provider assessment tool. Validation studies are to be conducted in a selection of low-resource countries. Meeting with the WHO and observing the processes involved in adapting the tool for use in low-resource countries (e.g. assess levels of health literacy, finding pictorial images to replace text) has provided me with a wealth of knowledge about collaborations and implementation of tools to practice. In addition to collaborating with the WHO I met with Professor D'Hooge and his colleagues from Leuven University to discuss and set-up an evaluation study of the FertiSTAT in primary and secondary medical systems within Belgium. This project is under development and will continue to run with Professor Boivin and Professor D'Hooge. Finally, the FertiSTAT has also been used and adapted by industry (Merck Serono) integrating the risk factors into a 'fertility compass' on their www.fertility.com patient advice website.
- Evaluating the acceptability and feasibility of the FertiSTAT. I conducted a series of interviews with 14 women (ten women with no prior experience of parenting or any attempts to get pregnant, four women trying to get pregnant). Participants were asked to complete a Think-aloud task using the FertiSTAT, verbalising their thoughts and opinions of the look, structure and content of the tool. After completion of the task I interviewed each participant. The semi-structured interview contained a framework of four sections (practicality; acceptability; perception of effects and impact; endorsement) to assess the acceptability and feasibility of the FertiSTAT. An additional section contained questions to assess beliefs and attitudes towards preparing for pregnancy. As well as forming the basis of a publication (under development) this work has resulted in an updates to the FertiSTAT layout and design based on the feedback interviewees provided during the Think-aloud task. It was pleasing to see that these changes were minimal and focused on better presentation of the male FertiSTAT items and clearer instructions on how to calculate the FertiSTAT score. 
- Dissemination encounters with medical professionals and media interest. I conducted a series of dissemination encounters with seven medical practitioners, a representative from a UK based sexual health charity, a representative from a UK based charity that provides advice, information and support for people experiencing infertility and a representative from an Inter-governmental organisation that provides guidance on international health issues. These one-to-one interviews enhanced my understanding about how these different groups can use the FertiSTAT and how best to disseminate the tool (e.g. self administered versus primary care assessment tool). I was invited to speak at the European society for Human Reproduction and Embryology to address clinicians on the ways FertiSAT can be used in clinics to empower patients to change their negative lifestyle habits and seek timely medical care. In addition, I presented the FertiSTAT at two general medical conferences (International Shared Decision Making Conference. June 2011. Maastricht; Society for Academic Primary Care (South West Region: SAPC-SWR) Annual Research Meeting. March 2011. Cardiff). My presentation at the SAPC-SWR meeting was highly commended in the closing ceremony. The development of www.fertistat.com and the translation of the FertiSTAT have enabled the tool to be featured in a number of media articles in the UK, Portugal and Japan. Finally, I published a paper with colleagues from the Cardiff Fertility Studies Research Group highlighting the importance of promoting informed decision making about fertility health issues which featured the FertiSTAT (Boivin, Bunting and Gameiro, 2013). 
- Understanding the application of research into practice. The work conducted with the WHO will use the FertiSTAT as a primary assessment tool for low-resource countries. I also wanted to explore the potential implementation of the FertiSTAT within the NHS. I have attended three training courses concerning communicating research to policy and practice and formulating policy recommendations and have also spent time shadowing clinical staff at a fertility clinic to better understand the processes involved in caring for people presenting with fertility difficulties and to see ways in which the FertiSTAT can be implemented into practice. In addition, the dissemination encounters with the general medical practitioners have provided insight into how and where best the FertiSTAT could be used in practice. Many of the medical practitioners felt that using the FertiSTAT could reduce potential conflict within consultations when discussing issues of lifestyle change (e.g. reducing weight, smoking, alcohol consumption) as the FertiSTAT could provide a means of eliciting a discussion about the risk factors for fertility without the medical practitioner being seen as making a personal judgement on lifestyle concerning the patient. All the general medical practitioners were keen to use the FertiSTAT within their practice and one has commented since completed the interview via email that she has &amp;quot;used some of the stuff in my consultations already!&amp;quot; General medical practitioners were very vocal in suggesting where to place the FertiSTAT into the NHS. Smear tests and routine contraceptive checks (e.g. regular blood pressure check for women using the oral contraceptive pill) with nurses was believed to be the most effective place to implement the tool into routine discussions about family planning. 
- Creation of www.fertistat.com. Through free support provided by the School of Psychology, Cardiff University I learnt how to programme and design web pages and online questionnaire forms. This enabled me to set-up a free FertiSTAT website that went live in October 2011. The website allows women to complete the FertiSTAT and gain personalised feedback about factors that can affect their fertility. The website records all the data of visitors completing the tool (e.g. risk factors, country of residence, age with their consent).
- Translation of FertiSTAT to reach wider communities. I organised the translation of FertiSTAT into the following languages with collaboration of the Cardiff University Translation Service: Chinese, Danish, Dutch, Italian, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese (European and Brazilian), Japanese, Russian, Swedish. These languages will be available via a free paper version of the FertiSTAT and on the www.fertistat.com website (online language functionality is under development).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The research conducted during the fellowship has provided research collaborations with the World Health Organisation (WHO) which has resulted in a PhD Studentship between the WHO and Cardiff University (Supervisor: Professor J Boivin) that aims to investigate the development and implementation of the FertiSTAT provider tool in low resource countries (start date January 2014).
