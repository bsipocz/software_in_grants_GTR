Study</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>G0300411</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>We aim to find out if carotid stenting, a new treatment for narrowing of the carotid artery in the neck, prevents subsequent stroke, as well as conventional surgery.

Surgery involves a cut in the neck to remove the narrowing, often under a general anaesthetic. This can occasionally cause stroke, heart attack or injury to nerves in the neck. In carotid stenting, a small wire mesh, known as a stent, is threaded up the artery to the narrowing through a small tube inserted in the groin under local anaesthetic. The stent is opened up inside the carotid artery to dilate the narrowing. This avoids a cut in the neck and general anaesthesia, but there is still a risk of stroke during stenting and we do not know how well it prevents stroke in the long term.

We are therefore comparing the two treatments in 1,500 patients, who have already had a small stroke caused by carotid narrowing. Half will be treated by surgery and half by stenting. They will then be seen for several years to record how many have another stroke or develop recurrence of narrowing. The results will help patients, doctors and the NHS choose between the two treatments.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Carotid endarterectomy is currently the standard treatment used to prevent recurrent stroke in patients with recently symptomatic severe carotid artery stenosis. However, carotid endarterectomy carries a small but significant risk of peri-operative stroke or death. Stenting, a new method of treating carotid atherosclerosis, has advantages in terms of patient comfort and avoids an incision in the neck. However, stenting may be more hazardous in terms of procedural stroke than carotid endarterectomy, does not remove atheromatous plaque, and may have an unacceptable incidence of restenosis. Systematic randomised evidence is required to inform patients, doctors and health service providers when choosing between these two treatments. We have therefore started a large international multicentre randomised trial, known as the International Carotid Stenting Study (ICSS), to compare the risks and benefits of carotid stenting with carotid endarterectomy in patients with severe ( 50% by NASCET criteria), recently symptomatic carotid stenosis. The protocol insists on selection of experienced operators with good track records and careful proctoring of less experienced operators to ensure patient safety. We plan to randomise 1500 patients in equal numbers between carotid endarterectomy and stenting using a computerised telephone randomisation service. Follow up is performed by an independent physician to record outcome events, which will then be adjudicated blind to treatment received. We anticipate a mean follow up period of 3 years. The primary outcome measure is the long-term rate of fatal or disabling stroke in any territory after randomisation to a policy of carotid stenting compared to surgery. Secondary outcome measures include stroke, myocardial infarction, or death within 30 days of treatment, treatment related cranial nerve palsy, treatment related haematoma, and restenosis during follow up. The trial will also incorporate an economic evaluation, measures of health status and an investigation of attitudes in the population to the risks of endarterectomy and stenting. The results of the trial will guide clinical and purchasing decisions about the optimum management of symptomatic carotid artery stenosis.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-12-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2005-12-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1582660</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Erasmus University Medical Center</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Netherlands, Kingdom of the</gtr:country><gtr:description>International Carotid Stenting Study</gtr:description><gtr:id>D3DBC30C-979F-4166-9F3E-DEE46BAA91CC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The trial has produced a definitive comparison of the short term safety of carotid stenting and carotid endarterectomy.
