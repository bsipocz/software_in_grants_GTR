This project, conducted between the Centre of Sustainable Aquaculture Research (Swansea), Exeter and Strathclyde Universities, and Plymouth Marine Laboratory, will address these challenges using a holistic multi-disciplinary approach. We will examine the physiological and life history responses of commercially important examples of bivalves, crustacea and finfish, using the large (750 m2 floor, 150 m3 water) state-of-the-art Centre for Sustainable Aquaculture Research at Swansea in which these organisms, together with their live food items, can be grown under the same conditions. We will compare the physiology and growth of the selected organisms at different water acidity and temperatures (increased acidity being associated with elevated CO2 and global warming). The output from these experiments will be scaled-up to identify effects at population and community levels. The consequences of these changes for the fishing industry will then be explored. OA, however, will not only affect commercially important species, and so the wider impacts for society of changes in marine ecosystems will also be examined. OA is expected to affect reproduction and early life stages in particular; our research will focus on egg fertilization and growth over the first 2-4 months. These stages can be acid-critical (e.g. sperm swimming is sensitive to acid levels) and are the most susceptible to the external environment due to their high surface-area: volume ratio and poor ability to compensate for changes in internal acidity. Early formation of shell and skeletal structures are also vulnerable to acid changes. OA will also provide direct and indirect effects through changes to food organisms. While it is not possible to change feed species composition, we will grow phytoplankton, zooplankton and other target animals to consider food chain impacts at different acidity levels and temperatures during their most sensitive period. This will enable us to consider the potentially synergistic effects of changes to food quantity and quality, the efficiency of food conversion into growth and energy, and the support of the food chain. Continuing these studies into juvenile stages will provide data for the impact of OA upon the most sensitive stages of cell growth. The results obtained during the studies of early life stages will be complemented by more detailed studies to identify the biological mechanisms that result in an organism's vulnerability to acidity and temperature change. Data from experiments will be used to develop models of organism growth which will provide a sound base for the future development of our understanding of OA upon other species. Supported with data collected from other OA projects, these models will then be developed to link with models that can explore the social and economic consequences to the fishing industry resulting from changes in fish populations. Existing models for such estimates are in their infancy but this project will integrate new developments that relate fisheries production to whole ecosystem ecology to improve upon classic, but simplistic, fisheries models. This is especially important when considering the impacts of global climate change and OA because of the varied interactions between organisms and their environment. Using the findings generated by this study and those arising from other OA projects, the wider impacts of OA on marine ecosystems will be explored. These will be used to examine how the benefits we obtain from the marine environment change (e.g. the availability of clean water for aquaculture and recreational activities, health benefits, and the regulation of gases and climate) and how the value of these benefits change. What these changes mean for industry and society will be explored.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-02-03</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-01-04</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>296889</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>MSCC/MASTS Bioeconomic Modelling in Policy &amp; Management</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0C43C2F1-7391-4F6B-B2B2-2CFC662E384A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Current policy making issues and how existing bioeconomic models can help on those were discussed.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56ce02dfd1bc80.82671918</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Dissemiation of information on the impacts of ocean acidification on shellfish - CEFAS Shellfish News</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9A118276-0E50-436B-A1B2-8CD3505FF4DB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Article on the possible impacts on ocean acidification on shellfish was written and published in a trade journal.

To do this, a number of benefits that society obtains from the marine environment have been identified. How these benefits might change has then been explored. In particular it has focused on changes in food provision and associated revenues and employment, carbon sequestration and storage, the removal of waste products by the marine environment, and perceptions and understanding of the ocean. Key findings include:

Shellfish harvests are likely to be the most impacted across the UK for the scenarios tested. Catches may decrease by 15-25% depending on the scenario used. This will lead to a decrease in revenue and employment losses to the fishing sector and its associated industries. England will potentially face greater losses compared to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, partly because its fishing industry is larger. Small-scale fishers (with vessels under 10m) are potentially more vulnerable than larger-scale fishers (with vessels over 10m).

Carbon sequestration and storage has been explored through the impacts of OA and temperature change on seagrasses. Findings suggest that if seagrass cover remains stable and carbon sequestration is maintained at the current rate then global sequestration potential between 2010-2100 is valued in the region of &amp;pound;220 billion UK Sterling (3.5% discount rate). If OA leads to a significant increase in the above- and below-ground biomass as anticipated, the capacity of seagrass to sequester carbon will be significantly increased, with an increase in value of approximately &amp;pound;100 billion. This highlights one of the few positive stories for OA and underlines that sustainable management of seagrasses is critical to avoid their continued degradation and loss of carbon sequestration capacity.

The impact of OA on the bioremediation of waste capacity of edible mussels has been explored through a literature review. Edible mussels filter sea water, playing an important role in the removal of wastes from marine environments. Studies show that mussels are affected by changes in pH due to OA, reducing their growth. This is forecasted to lead to reductions in edible mussel biomass of up to 50 %. A reduction in growth will also negatively affect the filtering capacity of each individual. This will ultimately lead to a decrease in the ability of mussels to remove wastes from the marine environment.

Public perceptions of OA are challenging to gauge as the UK general public is largely unaware of OA. There is confusion over what constitutes OA, even once supplied with information and given time to discuss this with experts. Nevertheless, the members of the public consulted demonstrate varying levels of concern ranging from the cataclysmic to those who report not to care. OA is discussed as a distant issue that is most likely to affect others in far off countries and in the future. Opinions on how to mitigate the effect of OA and whose responsibility it is to do this vary. Some recognise that it is the actions of each and every one of us that can make a contribution, while others expect governments to deal with the issues through technical fixes and legislation. A feeling of hopelessness, however, was common. One of the key issues arising from this is the low level of understanding by the public of the role of the ocean in their everyday lives. This raises a challenge about how best to communicate to the public the issue of OA and other threats facing the ocean.

Additional data have been collected on the publics perceptions of a changing marine environment and is currently undergoing analysis.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>There is currently very little academic work exploring the implications of ocean acidification (OA) on society. The outputs from this project are therefore timely and of relevance to government and industry bodies, as well as environmental managers, environmental NGOs and marine interest groups, the fishing and aquaculture sector, members of the general public as well as academic circles (in both natural and social sciences). Our findings support the need for improved management of our fish and shellfish resources as well as seagrass meadows and mussel beds. They therefore have implications for marine planning and the implementation of e.g. the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive.

The limited understanding of the ocean and issues such as OA by members of the public also raises a challenge for educators and potentially the creative industries. They may be able to help disseminate findings from science in novel ways that more effectively engage the non-science community. 

Academic circles may also take forward the work undertaken in this project. It provides a solid foundation for further studies on the societal impacts of OA and its mitigation.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>AAB4DD1D-9A58-429A-A226-A4B6AA13CA7E</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5448cf0ec66583.82152692</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Creative Economy,Education,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>We developed a new model based on SS-DBEM species distribution model which uses projected environmental variables (e.g. temperature, salinity, O2, pCO2, primary production and currents) from the coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical models. It uses current and past species distribution, the characteristics of the habitats (e.g. coral reef or distance from coast) and previous environmental conditions, (e.g. species habitat preference profile, Cheung et al., 2008). Given their importance, we considered possible changes in sea grass and seaweed coverage driven by simulated blooms, based on temperature and pH levels and potential effects on species attributed to habitat preferences. Next, the model combines past distribution of the species under study, with ecology and physiology theory based on both experiments and observations to parameterise the processes that drive responses to old and new conditions under scenarios of change (Cheung et al., 2011). These processes include individual growth rates, larval mortality and recruitment, and dispersal of larvae and adults. Instead of fixed values we allowed parameters values to change dynamically with the temperature and/or pH values projected by the biogeochemical model scenarios, according to experimental data or information derived from the literature. Finally, the model considers species interactions according to the size-spectrum theory (Jennings et al., 2008), to ensure the carrying capacity of individual geographical cells is not exceeded.

The model outputs consisted of yearly changes of species distribution and biomass with a horizontal spatial resolution of 0.5&amp;deg; x 0.5&amp;deg;. These were then used to investigate the intensity and direction of change in species distribution and biomass, and were averaged by decades to account for natural variability, between &amp;quot;present&amp;quot; (1991-2000) and three &amp;quot;future&amp;quot; periods (2011-2020, 2041-2050 and 2090-2099). Potential catches for each species were estimated using Maximum Sustainable Yield principles, using projected species' biomass and their intrinsic population growth rate (McAllister et al. 2001). This approach has been validated for the North Atlantic fisheries projections (Froese et al., 2012; Fernandes et al., 2013). 

Data generated from experiments undertaken within the NERC UK Ocean Acidification Research Programme (UKOA; Godbold and Solan, 2013; Queir&amp;oacute;s et al., 2014) were used to update model parameters. Information was supplemented with recently published literature on OAW (Hendriks, 2010; Melzner et al., 2009; Thomsen et al., 2010; Frommel et al., 2012; Schalkhausser et al., 2013). These further constrained the model parameters for commercially important species in the UK. Only results from exposure experiments running for longer than one month were used to limit the use of short-term experiments that are often quantifying responses to shock (Form and Riebesell, 2012; Williamson et al., 2013). Although longer experiments would be preferred, these are only now starting to emerge (Kroeker et al., 2013; Queir&amp;oacute;s et al., 2014; Mackenzie et al., 2014a,b). 

Experimental results were available for only a limited number of parameters for fish species, with more information available in the literature for shellfish (Wenberg et al 2012). The parameters for which experimental information was available include larval mortality (LM) from experiments with seabass (Pope et al., 2014); LM from Frommel et al. (2012) and length/weight relationship (LW) from Melzner et al. (2009) were available for cod; LM from Schalkhausser et al. (2013), LW, growth (G), larvae and adult dispersal for king-scallop; for blue mussel all of these parameters were available as well as additional information about adult mortality (AM) from Hendriks et al. (2010); and finally, for the common cockle we found bivalves generic parameters for LW and G (Hendriks, 2010), and AM from UKOA long-term soft sediment experiment (unpublished data, J.A. Godbold and M. Solan, University of Southampton). We excluded pelagic fish species since only one published paper on Atlantic Herring was found (Franke and Clemmesen, 2011).</gtr:description><gtr:id>2F24A804-AA55-4D9A-87AB-E07039085F6B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The results are being shown in several international conferences.
