Neuronal activity will be registered non-invasively with an electroencephalographic (EEG) system. Simultaneously, the subject's gaze will be recorded with an eye tracker. This combined methodology will represent a shift in the way conventional EEG paradigms are performed, where eye movements are minimised and experimental conditions are fully controlled by the experimenter. We propose to combine eye tracking and EEG to gain new insights into the neuronal underpinning of visual search. By merging both technologies, we will be able to study brain activity under naturalistic conditions where the subject decides where and how to explore a scene. Moreover, we will optimise different methodologies to assess and reduce the impact of eye movements on the EEG signal. Overall, this project has multiple areas of application including defence and the health-care sector.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research has the potential to have a wide impact over multiple application domains: The proposed methodology to obtain and analyse concurrent EEG and eye movements recordings will be considered for patent submission, directly benefiting the University of Leicester and increasing the economic competitiveness of the United Kingdom. A possible collaboration with NHS will be looked for to apply the methods developed during this project. This would benefit patients and healthcare practitioners. Visual search is a task of great importance appearing in diverse fields. For example, the military industry has multiple needs for aerial reconnaissance. The single-trial analysis of ERPs where subjects are allowed to change their gaze can improve the performance of subjects in time demanding decision-making tasks. This can potentially be relevant for national security. The proposed research's main ideas are easily comprehensible. This key fact will be used for reaching the general audience through several events for public engagement. This will contribute to increasing public awareness and understanding of science.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-01-03</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-11-04</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>101504</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Buenos Aires</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Argentina, Argentine Republic</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Computer Science</gtr:department><gtr:description>Juan</gtr:description><gtr:id>788BF6E9-0C9D-4ABD-9607-39DBF2CA6A54</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Lisandro Kaunitz, Juan E Kamienkowski, Alexander Varatharajah, Mariano Sigman, Rodrigo Quian Quiroga &amp;amp; Matias J.

For that purpose novel methodologies were developed to combine simultaneous electroencephalographic (EEG) and eye movements recordings. We designed an eye-movement visual search paradigm that allowed us to concurrently record EEG and eye movements while subjects were asked to find a hidden target face in a crowded scene with distractor faces. We calculated the brain signals aligned to fixations landing on targets and distractors and further compared those signals with the ones obtained in a control (classical) task at fixation. 

The original objectives of the proposal were largely achieved. As originally hypothesised, we showed the emergence of robust sensory components associated with the perception of stimuli and cognitive components associated with the detection of target faces, showing qualitative similarities as well as differences in terms of scalp topography and latency between free-viewing and classical tasks. 

By using single trial analyses, we also showed that fixations to target and distractors could be decoded from the EEG signals above chance level in 11 out of 12 subjects. 

Altogether, our results show that EEG signatures related to cognitive behavior develop across spatially unconstrained exploration of natural scenes and provide a first step towards understanding the mechanisms of target detection during natural search.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We believe our results will encourage further work to understand the mechanisms of object processing and target detection during visual exploration of natural scenes. The methodology we developed can be further exploited by Neuroscientists and Psychologists who routinely use EEG recordings. 
Visual search is a ubiquitous task of great importance appearing in many diverse fields. For example, the military industry has multiple needs for aerial reconnaissance. An expert typically has to quickly detect a structure. The single-trial analyses of ERPs aligned to fixation onset are potentially relevant for national security. 
In a wider context, the research grant could other applications in different domains. One example is the detection of drowsiness in drivers, where the simultaneous use of EEG and eye movements recordings could help detect when those drivers start to feel tired and possibly prevent dangerous accidents. 
The brain and eye-tracking technology could also be used to develop brain computer interfaces, which aim to restore movement or communication to people with serious movement disabilities. For instance, people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a disease that causes progressive degeneration of motor neurons, maintain good control of their eye movements until late stages of the illness.
 Incorporating eye-tracking with EEG control could lead to improved brain computer interfaces. The same principle could also be used for hands-free video games in which players control the action with their eye movements and thoughts.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>1D4BC484-58DE-46CF-9C7D-38A6B37E66D0</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546425af9dc497.03417427</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Healthcare,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S105381191301210X</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D05073D1-DDA6-4FA8-AF53-938380D1F170</gtr:id><gtr:title>Looking for a face in the crowd: fixation-related potentials in an eye-movement visual search task.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>NeuroImage</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/df9550471e9e1ac8df53921d1bfd4c2e"><gtr:id>df9550471e9e1ac8df53921d1bfd4c2e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kaunitz LN</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1053-8119</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>54642189d4b1a2.87107686</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7E8C1302-4A67-4056-B68F-5FD42AAAD8A4</gtr:id><gtr:title>EEG signal dynamics in unrestricted natural visual search</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/0031c7039b03549cbc7970ebb4fc10d5"><gtr:id>0031c7039b03549cbc7970ebb4fc10d5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Varatharajah Alexander</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c91b965ef322.89872963</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>001AB88F-405E-4FBB-A737-E924B1FE1211</gtr:id><gtr:title>Fixation-related potentials in visual search: a combined EEG and eye tracking study.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of vision</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9a0ce99828454b2047639af045acacad"><gtr:id>9a0ce99828454b2047639af045acacad</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kamienkowski JE</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1534-7362</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_55f973973a449672</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/I016899/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>55</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
