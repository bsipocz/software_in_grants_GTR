This is a major public health concern because these individuals are more likely than normal weight individuals to develop diseases, like diabetes and hypertension, which represent impaired cardiovascular and/ or metabolic (i.e., cardio-metabolic) functioning. This doesn't mean that if you are obese you are definitely going to get one of these diseases. There is considerable variability and people of the same age and weight may have very different health prospects. The goal of this grant is to help understand why the adverse effects of obesity on markers for cardio-metabolic disease (e.g., glucose levels and blood pressure) are less severe in some people than others or, put differently, why some people demonstrate cardio-metabolic resilience to obesity.

The literature has focused on investigating whether or not individuals who are obese but cardio-metabolically healthy are less likely to develop a disease or die compared to other groups of individuals (e.g., normal weight and healthy). Much less is known about the biological processes occurring across someone's life that lead to resilience. Obesity may, for example, be less detrimental among individuals who only recently became obese. Alternatively, being big or gaining lots of weight early in life may be a good thing if it reflects greater muscle mass, which is good for long-term health. Body size trajectories which describe how a person's weight (or some other measure) changes as they age are clearly important, yet the literature on this topic is limited. This grant will reveal which trajectories, from birth to adulthood, lead to someone being obese but having reduced cardio-metabolic disease risk. It will also clarify the role of puberty, the timing of which is closely linked to a person's trajectory. If individuals who are resilient to obesity go through puberty late, then gaining lots of weight early in life may actually be a bad thing because this leads to advanced puberty. By considering body size trajectories and pubertal development patterns together, we will paint a detailed picture of the basic biological processes underlying cardio-metabolic resilience to obesity. This information will not only represent a gain in scientific knowledge, but may stimulate other research (e.g., into the lifestyle behaviours that could be targeted to promote resilience) and be used to guide public health policies that aim to improve disease processes. 

This work will be conducted using data from three UK birth cohort studies, which have each recruited a group or cohort of individuals born at one point in time and followed them across their lives, collecting lots of information at different ages. Together, the studies include around 40,000 people, with the first cohort born in 1946, the second in 1958, and the third in 1970. All studies have measured body size at numerous ages, assessed pubertal development when the participants were teenagers, and performed a bio-medical assessment in adulthood, providing information on cardio-metabolic disease markers. A significant aspect of this grant will be collating all of this information, which spans much of the participants' lives, for detailed and powerful investigation within each study. Further, by working across the three birth cohort studies it will also be possible to determine how resilience to obesity (and the roles of body size trajectories and puberty) may have changed over time (e.g., from cohort one to cohort two to cohort three). This knowledge will represent a significant advancement in our understanding of population level changes in health among obese individuals.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Overweight or obese individuals, who now form the majority of United Kingdom (UK) population, do not represent a single homogenous group in terms of cardio-metabolic health prospects. The concept of metabolically-healthy obesity (MHO) has been widely debated. Regardless of one's perceptions of MHO, however, there is heterogeneity in cardio-metabolic risk factors among obese adults and little is known about the biological, life course processes that explain that heterogeneity. The aim of this grant is to reveal the body size trajectories and pubertal development patterns that might attenuate the positive associations of adulthood obesity with cardio-metabolic disease risk factors, thereby providing cardio-metabolic resilience to obesity. This information will not only represent a gain in scientific knowledge, but may stimulate other research and be used to guide public health policies that aim to improve disease processes. 

This is a secondary data analysis project across three large, nationally representative UK birth cohorts, the first born in 1946, the second in 1958, and the third in 1970. A significant aspect of this work will be collating and harmonising life course data across the studies, which will require close liaison with the key stakeholders, and developing advanced and powerful statistical models. Select observational findings will be followed-up in genetic instrumental variable analyses in large bio-medical surveys, thereby helping assess causality. Working across multiple cohorts born at different points in time adds another important aspect to this grant; we will be able to quantify any secular trend in resilience to obesity (and in the roles of body size trajectories and pubertal timing). This knowledge will represent a significant advancement in our understanding of UK population level changes in health among obese individuals.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research will benefit a broad interdisciplinary and international group of academics, who conduct aligned research on obesity, cardio-vascular disease epidemiology, child growth and development, and other topics. Our results will inform their on-going research, including trials that aim to alter body size trajectories. And may stimulate/ direct new lines of investigation through a better understanding of 1) the specific age period(s) important in the development of cardio-metabolic resilience to obesity and/ or 2) the group(s) of individuals (who share similar body size trajectories) in whom cardio-metabolic resilience to obesity manifests. To ensure that relevant academics benefit from this grant, results will be published in leading journals (and made open-access) and disseminated at conferences and workshops.

This grant is also potentially relevant to a wide range of clinicians. Child growth assessment/ monitoring is a fundamental part of routine care in the United Kingdom (UK), and by providing a better understanding of the role of growth and development in cardio-metabolic disease aetiology, our findings have the potential to impact on this practice and the guidelines on what constitutes healthy growth and development. Following on from this line of reasoning, paediatric obesity clinics may benefit from an improved understanding of which patients are going to suffer most from the cardio-metabolic complications of obesity, based on their body size trajectory. Similarly, the findings of this grant will allow cardiologists and other medical doctors to better understand which life course processes may have led to an obese patient presenting in their clinic with a cardio-metabolic complication or disease. This knowledge could also potentially be used to augment recommendations to parents and their children on how to maximise long-term cardio-metabolic health. 

Of course, the end goal of this grant is to provide a stronger literature base to inform public policy and clinical practice, as a means to impact on the health and wellbeing of the nation. This translation of results is most likely to occur by the findings of the proposed research being used by key decision makers to inform policy documents (e.g., the government's Childhood Obesity: Plan for Action document) and public health strategies. In particular, our results may be informative for characterising which individuals should be targeted for health care provision or therapeutic intervention and may be exploited for new evidence-based interventions that improve disease processes. Beneficiaries, therefore, include organisations such as Public Health England and the Medical Royal Colleges, as well as relevant policy research units.

The individual birth cohort studies, the units/ centres that house them, and the Cohort &amp;amp; Longitudinal Studies Enhancement Resources initiative will also benefit from this grant via 1) increased usage of the data and publication, 2) feedback of findings from the data collation/ harmonisation process, and 3) publicity from presentations at conferences, workshops, and any press releases. By depositing a final dataset in the UK Data Archive, thereby allowing other researchers to access and use the data, the legacy of this grant and its benefits to the studies will be maximised. 

Finally, this grant will have a significant impact on the career trajectory of the principal investigator and employed research associate, and they should also be considered beneficiaries.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>429327</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/P023347/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>160D22D0-5677-4513-A0AC-7F3526B7F336</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Metabolic and Endocrine</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>9A8BEDCC-D902-4C9A-8CCF-C974265EA3FB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.4  Surveillance and distribution</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
