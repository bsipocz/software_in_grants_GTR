In many regions, climate change is expected to reduce rainfall and bring about drought conditions, and water abstraction and river diversions may also reduce flows in rivers and streams. To date, relatively little work has been done to determine the effect of hydrologic droughts on aquatic biodiversity, and less is known about impacts on important processes, such as decomposition and nutrient cycling, that affect water quality and productivity of aquatic life.

Our study will use novel experiments to understand the ecological effects of hydrologic droughts in streams, with a view to predicting future change. We will use a series of artificial stream channels to directly manipulate flows, thereby simulating drought episodes, and measure the responses of flora and fauna, and a series of processes that reflect the ecological health of the ecosystem. We will establish a series of experimental drought treatments which differ in the extent of flow reduction, from unaltered reference conditions to extreme low flows that cause habitat loss. We will also examine how the physical nature of the stream bed affects the extent to which animals and plants can withstand periods of drought, and how quickly these communities recover from these events. With a project student, we will investigate how water abstraction, a leading anthropogenic cause of stream drought, affects biodiversity and functioning across a suite of lowland streams in south west England. Together, the results will give valuable insights into the ways in which the environment responds to change brought about through human activities and the likely effects of climate change.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research?

The main non-academic beneficiaries of knowledge arising from this research will be regulatory authorities (e.g. Environmental Agency of England and Wales, Natural England) and water companies (e.g. Wessex Water plc) who will be able to use outputs to inform policies of water resource management at the catchment scale. Governmental authorities determine water abstraction from rivers and groundwaters and river diversions that affect flows via regulatory policies (licensing) and catchment management planning. A clearer understanding of the link between river flows and ecological impacts is required to drive cost effective policies that have a demonstrable positive influence on measured ecological quality under the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD). Other potential beneficiaries include JNCC and associated organisations (e.g. Natural England) that are responsible for management of sites for conservation, and government-funded research centres (e.g. colleagues at Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, National Centre of Environment and Energy and Aarhus University - Denmark, CSIRO - Australia) advising on the implementation of environmental legislation. The management of river flows in catchments containing designated sites (e.g. SSSIs, SACs) may be necessary for sites to be maintained in favourable condition. This project will identify the extent to which drought conditions affect running waters and will identify key community and functional indicators of low flow stress. 

Our research is based on lowland streams, which have long been the subject of intense public interest as protected areas with high biodiversity and amenity value. As part of our current work with the EA in Hampshire (Dr Shirley Medgett, Technical Specialist) on effects of low flow and high nutrient loads on lowland rivers, we have engaged with the following stakeholders: Wessex Water plc (Fiona Bowles), The Test and Itchen Association (Technical Director Tom Davis), Game Conservancy (Bill Beaumont) and Wessex Chalk Stream and Rivers Trust (Mr Tom Davis), Vitacress Conservation Trust (Dr Steve Rothwell) and Upper Itchen Initiative (Graham Roberts). As part of the proposed research, we will seek to develop and extend knowledge exchange with such groups.

How will they benefit?

We will engage with these diverse groups via the following activities (see Pathways to Impact):

-Establishment of an Advisory Group from the outset to involve beneficiaries directly in the research and maximise the impact of the science. Representatives of national and international organisations have agreed to contribute (see letters of support and Pathways to Impact) including: project partners Freshwater Biological Association, Aarhus University Denmark, Natural England and Wessex Water plc. 

-A network of academics and non-academic beneficiaries will be established and two workshops held to review the current evidence base for low flow stressors and to develop collaborative projects that bridge the gap between freshwater science and water resource management. 

-Placements have been arranged for each PDRA with our project partner Natural England (Dr Chris Mainstone) and for the tied PhD student to work with our project partner Wessex Water pls (Ms Fiona Bowles). The three placements will enable the researchers to engage with local stakeholders and will facilitate two-way knowledge exchange between academics and practitioners.

-The science will be disseminated through high impact publications in scientific journals, including those with open access, and articles in popular publications like NERC Planet Earth, IEEM newsletters, through our project website hosted by UoB and through presentation of the findings at national and international conferences and smaller meetings attended by the above beneficiaries.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-12-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>216798</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Science Uncovered - Natural History Museum (September 2013)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>172C873B-E830-4EDD-9106-34616E0121CB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Science Uncovered is a widely-advertised and well-attended public outreach event hosted at the Natural History Museum in London, where scientist engage with the public face-to-face basis to discuss their research and its implications in an informal setting. I represented Imperial College London, accompanied by two PhD students, and discussed my group's work, which included the current grant, under the general theme of ecological responses and alterations to energy flux in food webs due to environmental stressors. At our stall we spoke to several hundred visitors throughout the day.

Here we have tested the effects of sustained drought on ecosystem structure (who and what are there) and ecosystem function (what the ecosystem does or provides us with e.g. freshwater etc.) in large, experimental streams. We have shown quite clearly that drought causes habitat compression which, in turn, feeds through to increased competition for resources among the animals living in the streams. Most alarmingly perhaps is the finding that drought has a profound effect on the pathways of respiration (energy generation) and balance of carbon gases being emitted from the streams. Under good, full-flow the streams overwhelmingly emit the less potent greenhouse gas carbon dioxide but, as drought intensifies, there is an exponential increase in the contribution from the far more potent gas, methane which matches carbon dioxide under the most extreme conditions. Drought through climate change will most likely compound the pressures already exerted on streams and rivers through over-abstraction of potable water, altering the good and services these valuable resources provide us with.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings provide clear guidance to policy makers that maintaining flow in streams and rivers is vital to preserve the integrity of their good and services. Decreasing flow will alter the output of greenhouse gases in previously unrecognized with the impact of drought going far beyond the immediate and visible loss of habitat and biodiversity.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>25596A9E-7B6E-41CA-B086-711B2038E8C5</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d6e21b64c4b7.40180910</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/J023736/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>60</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Climate &amp; Climate Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>1A1A6805-9DC4-4BCE-BC70-9F2AA4FD093B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ecol, biodivers. &amp; systematics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>60</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Climate &amp; Climate Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F4786876-D9A9-404D-8569-BBC813C73074</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Community Ecology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
