This project aims to excavate the narratives behind the numbers of poverty research, challenging the monopoly that economists and social scientists have had on approaches to poverty research. It uses the perspectives and tools of the arts and humanities not only to give a voice to poor communities around the world, the often silent majority, but also to diversify the production of representations of these communities and their histories. This project is not only trans-spatial but trans-temporal; it aims to take a long view, looking to history to understand the causes of inequality, and creating histories of communities which can be a source of empowerment and dignity, and using this as a platform to engineer alternative visions of the future and pathways of improvement of qualities of life. 

Building on existing partnerships, the poverty research network will use the AHRC grant to forge a carefully coordinated international dialogue, hosting events at 5 partner institutions around a theme that has been determined by those ODA recipient regions as most pertinent. The project has been planned to represent different regions of the world that have been the subject of development policies, and to discuss different themes relating to development agenda in each location. The selected regions and themes are: Bangladesh, 'Women, Migration and Poverty'; Brazil, 'Poverty, Tourism and Forced Labour'; Indian Ocean World, 'Poverty, inequality and the politics of natural resources'; Mexico 'Poverty and Indigeniety'; South-East Europe, 'Intersecting patterns of poverty and the position of marginalized Romani minorities and post-conflict migration in Eastern Europe'. The project will finish with an event at the University of Warwick, where representatives of the different regional events will attend and present summaries of their findings and have the opportunity to hear about experiences and ideas of solutions from different parts of the world, thinking about shared experiences, and regional variations. The Warwick event will happen in conjunction with an exhibition, which further aims to diversify representations of poor communities around the world. 

The key output of the poverty research network will be the locally produced 'Archive for Alternate Futures'; a website which captures stories of local communities, their histories, and their visions for achieving more equal futures. The project also aims to contribute to the transformation of modes of research project and policy formation, forging methodologies, experiences, and tools, for dialogic approaches to poverty research and poverty reduction strategies, and integrating the insights of histories.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research network will benefit scholars, policymakers, civil society organisations and local communities across five carefully selected ODA recipient nations (Bangladesh, Brazil, the Indian Ocean World with an event in South Africa, Mexico, and South East Europe with an event in Slovenia), and within the UK itself. The network will encompass a wide range of academic professionals, along with activists, NGOs, aid practitioners, policymakers, political campaigners, journalists, and local community leaders. Its work will focus on capturing how different narratives of poverty and poverty reduction have been conceptualised and articulated in ODA recipient nations, with the aim to not only provide people who have been the object of poverty discourses a voice and chance to share their experiences and ideas of solutions, but also to diversify the subjects and productions of history through engagement with the often silent majority of global communities. The poverty research network thus aims to initiate a change in mainstream narratives of poverty constructed by economists and social scientists.

The network will be established, and its findings and outputs disseminated, through a series of workshops, a major concluding international conference, and a dedicated project website. The following users will particularly benefit from the building of a cohesive network:

1. Through the series of workshops in five ODA recipient nations, the Network will connect academic researchers with non-academic civil society actors from these locales, including activists, aid practitioners, political campaigners, artists, religious leaders and journalists. In doing so, the Network will create an international forum for people who have been the object of poverty to express their empowerment and share their experiences, histories, traditions, and ideas of solutions to social injustice. The dedicated project website will act as a forum for exchanging experiences and ideas about poverty and its solutions, providing a window onto the experiences and ideas of people on the frontline of poverty politics around the world. The website will carry reports of the projects in each of the localities, but it will also host a blog space where people can discuss and debate. 

2. The network will disseminate this local knowledge and expertise to international development policymakers and practitioners in the United Kingdom, with an aim to promote alternative visions of development to those set out in the UN 2030 Agenda and Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). Officials from the UK governmental Department for International Development (DFID) will participate in the concluding international conference at the University of Warwick, building on established links between the two institutions. UK development policy will be influenced through the conference discussions, the production of a set of policy recommendations, and the co-production of a policy paper with DFID officials. Findings will also be disseminated through these channels to representatives from leading UK-based international development NGOs (Oxfam and Save the Children) and the Overseas Development Institute (ODI), who have agreed to participate in the concluding conference.

3. Exhibitions will be organised in tandem with the Network workshops, to share the local stories and narratives that have been gathered from activists, NGOs, academics, and the people within communities that have been the traditional object of poverty discourses. Smaller versions of these will be gathered for an exhibition on global poverty politics at the University of Warwick, which will be held in conjunction with the concluding conference.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>47544</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/P006280/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:parents><gtr:parent><gtr:id>714EA2D7-91EA-4191-A0EE-C31C73A6CE8D</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>AH/P006280/1</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>47544.23</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2016-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2017-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:children><gtr:child rel="Transfer"><gtr:id>631F031E-09FA-4AD6-92B9-59702B24D136</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>AH/P006280/2</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>39190.86</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2017-08-07</gtr:start><gtr:end>2018-11-06</gtr:end><gtr:children/></gtr:child></gtr:children></gtr:parent></gtr:parents></gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AC8CEC39-DB37-4D0E-9EEA-A3CFC91618F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DCE73056-5E3D-4976-B573-234E5FF4D633</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic &amp; Social History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>319D6F57-4306-40E8-9F0A-84D514AAF7FC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Imperial/Colonial History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>D640D1B8-B141-4DFC-BCD3-CEADD848A918</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>GCRF</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
