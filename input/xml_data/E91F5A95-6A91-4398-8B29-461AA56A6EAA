The tour will visit 72 Schools over a two year period and engage over 4320 year 9 and 10 pupils in a creative learning activity. The principle issues explored in the play are the impact of science and engineering on everyday life, the creativity inherent to science and engineering and the personal rewards of working in science and engineering. At the heart of the project is a creative partnership between University scientists and engineers engaged in cutting-edge research, writers and performers from the dramatic arts and teachers in Schools. The project embodies thinking across boundaries to challenges accepted perceptions of science and engineering and the individuals that work in those professions. Exploration of a human story is used to pose questions. Why do people study and work in science and engineering? What are their motivations, what are their rewards? Wider, open questions concerning how their activities impact society, and are driven by their needs and by the needs of society, are also posed. There will be workshop sessions facilitated by the actors in which the audience invents desirable technologies and the actors will then improvise a sketch based on the world before and after the arrival of the new technology. The trial version of the play was developed under EPSRC support for public engagement and partnerships that was built into a Portfolio award held at the University of Birmingham. The pilot enabled the team to learn what interests the target audience and what their perceptions and concerns are. This front-end evaluation was an important first step towards the current project, because the objective in Theatre in Education is to challenge existing thought. The pilot also allowed the team to try various strategies for evaluation and ensuring long-lasting impact which will be carried forward into the new project. The pilot showed the potential for a significant impact on the thoughts of the participants. Indeed, both the cast and the audience reported shifts in perception about the nature of science and engineering as activities within society. An increased awareness of career structures was an unexpected additional benefit. The delivery of the piece will take place in two series, the second being modified as a result of the evaluation of the first. A full summative analysis of the impact of the play and of the depth of the learning experience will be performed in the later stages. This will include feedback from immediately after the performances and feedback from lessons delivered afterwards, using resource packs supplied to the schools.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>EPSRC has signposting lists in Information and Communications Technology. One grand challenge that falls within this list is minimising the energy demands of electronics. One approach to minimisation of demands on resources is to research materials and devices which offer low power dissipation and multi-functionality. Examples of such materials are superconductors and ferroelectrics. Applications of superconductors include medical diagnostic imaging (MRI scans). Present and future applications of ferroelectrics include systems such as radar and microwave point-to-point communications. Increasing demands for access and data rate are driving research on reconfigurable systems and devices to higher frequencies (10-100 GHz instead of the 1-10 GHz mostly used today). Systems-level engineering, chip design and software engineering alone won't yield the improvements required without research into the materials and components from which chips and systems are built. The impact of such systems on our daily lives is clear if imagine hospital transplant and cancer units without medical scanners, or returning to a world without broadband or mobile phones. The investigators have, between them, around 40 years experience of research in electronic materials and devices in Physics, Materials Science and Engineering disciplines, funded mainly by ESPRC. They also have training and experience in communicating science and engineering to non-specialists. They are therefore well placed to deliver a project which brings the impact of EPSRC funded research to the fore. There is well documented research evidence that the general public is not deeply aware of the role played by scientists and engineers in bringing technological and cultural change to society. There is little appreciation of the creativity and personal rewards of working in science and engineering, of the good career prospects available or of the opportunities for travel and personal development. It is particularly important to challenge these misconceptions in young people before they make study choices which determine their future careers and before they become effective in forming opinion in society. This project aims to address views held by Year 9/10 pupils in the West Midlands. The curriculum for that age group specifies consideration of the impact and influence of science on society. A pilot project has shown that the method chosen is capable reaching out to the target audience. The way in which the principle target audience will benefit is from participation in a Theatre-In-Education (TIE) production. They will be enabled as partners in the project by it being toured to schools in the West Midlands. The production will be designed by the investigators and two sub-contracted partners: the director and a professional TIE company experienced in touring and working with the targeted age group. A project secretary will work on the administration of the project, including evaluation. TIE is different from simply performing a dramatic piece. Complex issues are explored through the conflicts and dilemmas that arise in the lives of the participating audience. Participating is a crucial word, as the audience develops ideas and themes and influences how they are worked out. This has been shown to facilitate a deep learning experience and have a profound impact. Key to achieving that impact is working with relatively small groups. In this project we will work with a large number of groups. In order to widen the impact further we will develop subsidiary resources such as a project web site and press releases. These will engage a larger audience with the issues raised and will allow us to advertise the impact of EPSRC-sponsored research and public engagement more widely.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-05-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-07-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>115481</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Gazebo Theatre Company</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Gazebo Theatre in Education</gtr:description><gtr:id>4108B420-078A-4A60-BA84-7B316DF18C0B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b9729034b9729048-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>The theatre company provided actors, rehearsal space, expertise in organisation, expertise in evaluation, transport for the project.

'Change Your World' was been tried and tested in 6 primary schools. Here are comments from some participants:

&amp;quot;It was amusing and we learnt a lot from it&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;We liked making mobile phones out of our bodies using different sounds and emotions&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;The best part was when we made an invention&amp;quot;



Schools made reports for the school newsletter and assemblies.Lesson plans for further impact to reinforce concepts and spread science into the non-science curriculum are provided.

Beneficiaries: 120 primary school chidren, teachers and accompanying adults

Contribution Method: The workshops were developed as a spin out from the Magnets, Ducks and Superconductors play and enabled by our contacts with actors and the theatre company Gazebo. The findings of the play (see Key Findings) informed the design of the workshops.

An interactive theater production supported by the EPSRC Partnerships for Public Engagement program (&amp;pound;115k ? 2 years) challenging the conceptions of science and engineering held by Year 9 secondary school children (38 schools visited with participation from entire year groups with no selection, totaling over a total of 1140 children). Questionnaires and feedback from teachers show that every performance increased understanding of the impact of science and engineering on society, of the personal and societal motivations behind science and engineering and of career opportunities.

Beneficiaries: 1140 Year 9 children

Contribution Method: The central scientific themes included superconductivity (Quantum Fluids and Systems) for which we have previously received EPSRC support.</gtr:description><gtr:id>7BABE93A-359A-4FD8-B3E7-7F2C2745AFF1</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>m-4152690995.626795de2599f2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The findings relate to secondary school children at Year 9 level . 
1. Children are surprised to see &amp;quot;people like them&amp;quot; with aspirations and world views like theirs can be scientists and engineers. We also found this to be true at primary school (Key Stage 2) level. 
2. Children and teachers are surprised by the direct links between laboratory science (in our case quantum mechanics, electromagnetism and electronic materials) and issues of concern to society (security of energy supply). 
3. Teachers find examples of the societal impact of science and engineering hard to teach and need examples/case studies of applications and exploitation. 
4. Children of all abilities can be engaged in creative activities and discussions based around science. 
5. Children of all abilities can discuss science in a social context using articulate arguments based on facts and can distinguish fact from opinion. 
6. Stimulating curiosity, a little mystery, showing relevance, challenging preconceptions all help children get engaged in engineering and technology. 
7. Drama engages children who teachers report to have shown no previous interest in science and who don't pay attention in lessons. 
 8. Drama works will with children with special educational needs. 
9. In some &amp;quot;high performing&amp;quot; schools, science and engineering are seen as second best careers compared with law and medicine. There is not much careers advice for &amp;quot;becoming a scientist&amp;quot; or knowledge of the pathways into such a career. 
 10. Children are bored by science lessons and surprised that science can be exciting. 
11. Drama creates a model of the world which enables exploration, explanation, prediction, testing outcomes, as do science and engineering. The technical content of science theatre is off putting to some theatre practitioners but intellectually there is a lot of common ground which means collaborations between practitioners in both fields can be fruitful. 
12. The emotional and personal (not financial) rewards of perseverance with science can be recognised by children. The idea that scientists are international travellers was new to many children and attractive. We also found this to be true at primary school (Key Stage 2) level. We believe this finding should be used more often in efforts to widen participation. Benefits to society and approval from peers can also be recognised.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The project has been delivered entirely in a non-academic context. The method has been described in an Education journal under teaching innovation so is now available for practitioners to follow if they wish. The project website is publically available and provides summaries of the evaluation. Lesson plans based on the project have been provided to all participating schools. The findings and recommendations for future projects were presented at the Association for Science Education Conference in Liverpool, January 7th, 2012 to a specialist audience.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E65B1C6C-C692-4115-A102-570D02CBD9EA</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-1750551920.151852177627322</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Energy,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.publicengagement.ac.uk/case-studies/magnets-ducks-and-superconductors</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6F3228D0-B45C-4E6D-A3F7-3164A2EE9E8F</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Play's The Thing</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/fee61e8e253acd91690416de7aa9bf2e"><gtr:id>fee61e8e253acd91690416de7aa9bf2e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Tim Jackson (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>r_2689002602cad35ba0</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/H046534/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>97B14C81-E082-430E-BC8F-733274083163</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Supercond, magn. &amp;quant.fluids</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A3511416-4477-494C-B6DC-0B92BFD2ECBA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Quantum Fluids &amp; Solids</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
