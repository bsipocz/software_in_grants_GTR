individuals are prone to recurrent epileptic seizures, is the most common chronic neurological disorder in children. Epilepsy onset is most common in the first 2 years of life and at this age is particularly associated with poor prognosis for seizure control and neurodevelopmental outcome. The ketogenic diet (KD) is a medically supervised dietary intervention that is high in fat and restricted in carbohydrate and protein, designed to mimic the effects of starvation on the body. KD therapy has been shown to be an effective treatment for seizure control in children with epilepsy older than 2 years of age. Other associated benefits can be a reduced requirement for both routine and emergency anti-epileptic drugs (AED) and less seizure-related hospital admissions. Although reports suggest that KD therapy also improves seizures in younger children there are no high quality trial data that demonstrate effectiveness and safety in this age group. The KD is resource intensive, requiring dietietic and physician time; data are required to justify expansion of services to cater for the apparent need. There are also few data on treatment of infantile spasms, the most common seizure type in this age group, when first line treatment (corticosteroids or vigabatrin) have failed. We therefore propose a prospective multicentre randomised trial to investigate the effectiveness and safety of the KD in children with epilepsy under the age of 2 years, who have failed to respond to two or more AEDs. We also aim to try and find the underlying basis to the effect of the diet. Children for this study will be recruited from 9 paediatric neurology centres in England who have an established KD service. After a baseline assessment and two week observation period children will be randomly assigned to either receive the KD or a further AED. The allocated treatment will be started and it's effectiveness assessed after 8 weeks of treatment. Standardised seizure diaries will be used to record seizures and related events, questionnaires will be used to assess tolerability of treatment, quality of life and neurodevelopment, and growth and blood biochemistry will be monitored. The information obtained from this study is necessary to optimise choices in epilepsy treatment, aiming to improve outcomes and thus determine whether and when the KD should be considered in this young age group. We are in an excellent position to lead this trial having successfully conducted the first randomised trial investigating KD in older children at Great Ormond Street Hospital. We also have experience of working together with the other centres collaborating in this project which all have established KD services. The requested costs will enable these services to enrol eligible patients into the study and collect results, as well as fund a central research coordinator. Funds are also requested to investigate the possible role of medium chain fatty acids in the effect of the diet</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Onset of epilepsy is most common in the first 2 years of life (56-83/100,000 children/year) and at this age is particularly associated with poor prognosis for seizure control and neurodevelopmental outcome; children resistant to medication are amongst the most burdensome to medical and care services long term. Reduction in seizure frequency and antiepileptic drug (AED) dependence will have beneficial financial implications for NHS service providers. The ketogenic diet (KD) is a high fat, low carbohydrate, resource-intensive treatment designed to induce ketosis and other biochemical changes associated with the state of starvation. Our group published the first randomised controlled trial demonstrating KD effectiveness in children age 2-16 years in 2008; no such trial has been conducted in infants despite open label data suggesting greater effectiveness in this age group. The aim of this proposed project is to determine the effectiveness of the KD compared to alternative further AED treatment in children with epilepsy aged 3 months to 2 years who have failed to respond to two or more pharmacological treatments (AED or corticosteroids). Our hypotheses are that the KD is more effective than conventional management with a further AED in the treatment of infants with drug resistant epilepsy, and that the KD is a safe and tolerable intervention to use in this group. Further, understanding that clarity is required with regard to the underlying mechanism involved in effect, we will be evaluating the role of medium chain fatty acids in the blood of participants on the KD. Recruitment will be from 9 collaborating paediatric neurology centres with existing KD services. Eligible and consented children will undergo baseline assessment, including medical and seizure history, neurological and anthropometric examination, administration of Infant Toddler Quality of Life and Vineland Adaptive Behaviour (neurodevelopmental) questionnaires, and biochemical investigations required for routine monitoring. Standardised seizure recording will be commenced. After a 2-week observation period with no change to regular AEDs, they will be randomised to receive the KD or a further AED. A second assessment (4 weeks after start of treatment) will include clinical review and questionnaire on tolerability for both groups. All assessments/investigations except neurodevelopmental questionnaire will be repeated at 8 weeks. At this appointment, according to patient response, KD (diet group) or AED (standard AED group) will then be continued or changed. Those in the AED group if failed will then be offered KD outside the context of the trial. All patients will be followed and reassessed at 12 months including clinical review, Quality of Life and neurodevelopmental questionnaires, as well as blood evaluation if clinically required. To allow detection of a significant difference in mean percentage change in seizures from baseline between the two groups, at 90% power and 5% significance, accounting for 10% drop out and therapist effect inflation, a total sample size of 160 is required. If drop out is 20%, this sample size will still have 86% power. Primary outcome will be the number of seizures experienced during weeks 6-8. Secondary outcomes will include number of children seizure free, responder rate, KD tolerance as well as the relationship between medium chain fatty acids and seizure control. Data will be analysed using random effects modelling.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>196169</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>UMC Utrecht</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Netherlands, Kingdom of the</gtr:country><gtr:description>European Reference Network for Rare and Complex Epilepsies EpiCARE</gtr:description><gtr:id>40006593-5755-41AE-B2E8-1BF86F2849FC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This partnership/collaboration has just been launched.

b. To consolidate country wide networks, and referral pathway to ERN
c. To consolidate the pathway for referral to each sub-network, or ultimately discussion within the virtual MDT
d. To continue and widen applicability of the virtual MDT meetings, through the centralised IT platform extending the ongoing work from E-pilepsy. 
2. To develop treatment protocols and monitor standardised outcomes of rare and complex epilepsies.
a. To establish the individual working groups forming the basis to the work packages
b. To establish regular web communication between the working groups
3. To improve awareness and accessibility to protocols for physicians and individuals with rare and complex epilepsies across Europe for treatment
a. To establish the governance structure of the network through consolidation and appointment to the committees;
