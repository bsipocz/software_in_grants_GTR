complex</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Intramural</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>MC_U117574559</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>In multi-cellular organisms the proliferation, differentiation and death of individual cells is highly regulated by the action of both proteins and chemical factors, and by the specific nature of the contacts between cells. The interactions at the cell surface receptors are communicated to the inner workings of the individual cells by the specific structural or chemical response of the receptor inside the cell. In turn the modified protein can then either alter its own function or specifically recruit additional proteins that in turn are modified so as to transfer the signal down a molecular chain. In this manner, signals are transduced within cells by chemical modification pathways: often the pattern of such pathways is multiply divided and cross-linked. Our understanding of these processes is growing all the time, providing a framework within which many drug discovery programmes are being pursued. My interest is to contribute to this field through the combined structural, functional and biophysical analysis of a particular subset of cell surface receptors known as the death receptor superfamily. The ligands to these receptors have the function to induce programmed cell death that leads to the elimination of specific cell types in a highly regulated manner. Such processes are important for the proper regulation of the immune system, and in the development of organs and tissues. It is through an enhanced understanding of the precise mechanism of action of cell surface receptors that we can hope to develop new approaches to diseases that might benefit from artificially accelerated cell death or conversely protection from inappropriate elimination of specific cell types</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Death receptors of the TNF receptor superfamily are activated by interaction of their ectodomains with oligomeric ligands that promote clustering of receptor chains. These molecular aggregates induce the recruitment of multiple downstream adaptor and effector proteins into signalsomes known as death-inducing signalling complexes (DISCs) because of their role in initiating programmed cell death mechanisms. To address fundamental questions of the mechanism of death receptor signalling an examination of precisely defined preparations of receptors and downstream ligands is planned. Such experiments are performed ex vivo in order to trap the evolving complex at a point in the signalling mechanism that allows for analysis of the size, stoichiometry and potentially 3D structure. Due to the recognized difficulty of preparing membrane-bound proteins in a realistic membrane context, in yield sufficient for structural studies, we will appeal to other modes of tackling this problem. In this new project we will explore the potential of a general approach that can be termed reconstitution of constrained receptor signalling complexes. The functionally trapped or constrained complexes can be then be the subject of biochemical and biophysical analyses.|The first system that we will explore is the DISC formed upon activation of the CD95(Fas) receptors. I have a long-established interest in the CD95-DISC, formed upon ligation with CD95-ligand (FasL), based upon our earlier work to solve the 3D solution structure of the death domain (DD) from the pivotal DISC protein FADD. Our more recent work has probed the interaction between the FADD death domain and its homotypic binding partner in the CD95 receptor. It was presumed that the CD95 receptor is activated by FasL-dependent oligomerization to form trimers, but recent evidence suggests that higher order clustering is required. These observations are in line with our own recent experiments that demonstrate that CD95-DD/FADD-DD complexes have a much higher molecular mass than predicted by the common trimer model. |The clustering of the cytoplasmic domains leads to the sequential recruitment of the adaptor protein FADD and then the zymogen form of the initiator apoptotic protease, caspase-8. Induced proximity of procaspase-8 is sufficient to promote autoproteolysis and the downstream cascading activation of apoptosis pathways. The objective of this project is to develop methods to obtain constrained forms of the DISC suitable for biophysical analysis. The approach will be to either separately or co-express all components of the DISC. Intact DISCs will be purified by affinity chromatography and size exclusion methods and will be characterised by ESI-mass spectrometry. The DISCs will be analysed a battery of biophysical methods to establish size and composition, and the expression constructs will be modified to optimize the DISCs for 3D structure studies, which could include attempts to obtain crystals for X-ray diffraction or electron microscopy, or undertake heteronuclear NMR studies. |We are expanding our approach to the investigation of death receptor signalling to cover, in addition to CD95(Fas) the homologous FADD-dependent tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptors (TRAIL-R1/R2), which have been identified as therapeutic targets in cancer: administration of the TRAIL-ligand has been shown to selectively induce cell death of transformed cells.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2003-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>5494109</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University College London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Division of Medicine</gtr:department><gtr:description>VEGF-Neuropilin</gtr:description><gtr:id>733338CF-A6C0-4C43-A873-7875100116DB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Our work demonstrated that the synthetic peptide retains the pseudo-globular three-dimensional structure of a larger recombinant fragment of VEGF, and indicated that the extreme C-terminus of this molecule, known to be critical for biological activity is flexible in solution.

The latest work, on the mechanism of PLC?1, provides a holistic picture of the multimodular nature of the enzyme, and in particular for the first time provides a 3D picture of the highly unusual pseudocyclic specific array element of the structure. The mechanistic model provides a framework for further probing the impact of disease-related mutations in PLC? isoforms and a platform for ongoing attempts to resolve the high resolution 3D structure of the enzyme and its complexes with binding partners.

We combined our structural and biophysical data with these biochemical and cell-based measurements that together has led us to propose a mechanism for the regulation of PLCg1 by growth factor receptors, that invokes the following:
(i) growth factor receptor recruitment of PLC?1 via the exposed specific array nSH2 domain; (ii) Tyr783 phosphorylation in trans, (iii) PLC activation by intramolecular competition of cSH2 binding to the catalytic domain; and (iv) subsequent release of the active enzyme from the receptor.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Previously we determined the 3D structure and protein association characteristics of the 'split pleckstrin homology (spPH)' domain from phospholipase C gamma-2 (PLC?2) using heteronuclear multi-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. 

More recently we have characterized the 52 kDa multi-domain 'specific array' (SA) regulatory element of the homologous PLC?1 using a combination of heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy and small angle X-ray scattering data, as well as the dependence of the conformation upon interaction with FGFR kinase and phosphorylation of a critical tyrosine residue (Tyr783) implicated in activation of the phospholipase activity. We demonstrated that the specific array cSH2 domain can bind the core region of PLC?1 (i.e. lacking the catalytic domain) and that this interaction is competed off by a phosphopeptide corresponding to the specific array cSH2-SH3 linker and containing phosphoTyr783.

Some of the features of the RA2/ras interface are unique to PLCe, while the ability to make contacts with both switch I and II regions of ras is shared only with phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase.

In spite of the importance of these receptors to basic organismal physiology the precise mechanism of activation and regulation of this important set of receptors is poorly understood, in part because high resolution structural information has been lacking. Our work provides a framework for a wide constituency of interested scientists, including our own collaborators, to rapidly assess the potential mechanisms of action of new mutations that are emerging in the fields of diabetes and obesity, cancer and aging. The project was multidisciplinary: we provided expertise in sequence and structure-based bioinformatics, database and web-portal design; our partners provided all of the relevant biological data for the project.
