Across the world inmates often work for prison industries to keep busy, earn some income and learn new skills that may lead to future employment opportunities, but prison industries rarely focus on creative thinking processes that help educate prisoners to become more resilient in the highly competitive and changing work places of the city where expectations of employment are often not met amongst marginalised groups, who in huge numbers fail to find legitimate employment and thus resort to crime. This project aims to help break that cycle. 
In most prisons 'educational' and 'work' experiences are disconnected, and delivered separately; this project aims to innovate a new approach. It will explore if and how design engagement with prison industries may offer new opportunities to connect with hard to reach prisoners. Also to draw on design to address the gap that currently exists between 'vocational' and 'educational' approaches to increasing employability amongst prisoners. The project will introduce analytical approaches associated with 'design-thinking' (Kimbell, 2009, 2011) in accessible and visual ways into vocational prison industry activities, so that inmate learning can occur in pragmatic vocational contexts, producing a trial anti bag theft design or accessory. This 'Makeright' product currently being proposed - a label to be created by DACRC in both cities - will engage inmates in co-designing and making products to protect potential victims from crime. Ultimately to deliver a form of 'restorative justice' by helping others avoid crime and perhaps also generating a much needed income stream for prisons.
A pragmatic approach to thinking/making may suit some inmate learning styles. The aim is to develop and test new opportunities for prisoners to engage in traditional prison industry activities empowering them to learn additional skills (such as improved communication, collaboration, systemic reasoning and empathy) via the design of an anti theft bag or accessory. These skills may be achieved via an experimental approach to teaching 'design-thinking' to inmates linked to prisoner engagement with the Makeright product range both in London and Ahmedabad. Prof Lorraine Gamman and Adam Thorpe of the Design Against Crime Research Centre (DACRC) at Central Saint Martins will work in partnership with HMP Wandsworth, London and will lead the project. They will collaborate with Dr. Praveen Nahar of the National Institute of Design, Creative Writer Aliya Curmally and with Sabarmati Jail, in Ahmedabad to test the creative research materials/design brief generated by DACRC, and observe whether or not they have efficacy, and to write up.
In order to create the protocols for the project, the teams will consult with many stakeholders inside and outside of prison both in London and Ahmedabad to ensure creative materials are 'fit for purpose'. Here we wish to also understand whether or not our creative input can find new ways to improve the operational capacity of prison industries both in London and Ahmedabad, and thus serve inmates better in the outside world when seeking employment or self created enterprise opportunities. Also to find out whether it is possible to build the innovative capacity of prisons by beginning to reframe prison industries as a location of a 'creative hub' where new employment skills and opportunities can be developed/ fostered. To share our learning from the project the team anticipate creating diverse outputs including presentations to government, stakeholders and academics that discuss whether our approach to prison industries and the Makeright label build resilience and positively impact (or &amp;quot;unbox&amp;quot;) on inmate experience.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Project pathways are linked to HE and prison government in London and Ahmedabad and cover both academic, professional and enterprise networks. Jason Swettenham of the UK HM Prison Service, Jessica Plant of the Arts Alliance, Ezio Manzini of the Design for Social Innovation and Sustainability (DESIS) network (www.desis-network.org) and the DESIS-UK network (www.desis-uk.org) have all expressed interest in the work as have colleagues from Unbox and the Indian Design Forum (via Aliya Curmally) and are all likely to promote findings. In fact the initial Unbox engagement in March 2014 regarding the project development has already attracted some international press interest, for example The Times of India (Ahmedabad) covered the beginning of the project as follows: http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/National-Institute-of-Design-UK-based-faculty-plan-course-for-jail-inmates/articleshow/31557267.cms. We also believe there are some opportunities presented by websites such as the Open University virtual campus which offenders can access: http://www.open.ac.uk/about/offender-learning/data-and-developments/virtual-campus, as well as virtual design campus site created by NID and IIT: http://www.dsource.in who have already expressed interest in this project and in any materials we may be able to share digitally.


There are many prison educational courses, but few that engage with prison industries so this work and consequent academic outputs from the project are likely to be unique in terms of building confidence and communication skills linked to employability and social resilience. This project will be of interest to a wide cohort including those organisations who work directly with prison industries, third sector organisations working with employability and enterprise that may be interested in finding out more about designing thinking tools, including the Third Sector Research Centre (TSRC), the Charities Commission and the National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO) as well as the UK HM Prison Service itself who are slow to change because information is not widely shared and therefore need new information routes. Stakeholder engagement is envisaged as part of the PI and Co-I's remit in developing the work and consulting others in the field about teaching materials to be created. We anticipate the iterative design process we will adopt may also leverage existing networks of intermediary organisations whose members work in this area and may wish to promote the work at a later date. The research process will accommodate feedback and comment from key providers regarding the teaching materials to be created. Such feedback may come from those already mentioned including some of the 500+ individual service providers represented by the Arts Alliance members. The ambition is that the learning from this action research project will be publicised via existing relevant digital and print media. The case study to be created is also likely to have impact given it will be showcased at dissemination events in London and Ahmedabad, and existing online platforms.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>20732</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Stretch worked with Makeright inmates at HMP Thameside to document their personal narratives in digital form regarding inmate learning (this work was funded by the lottery grant Stretch were in receipt of).

This includes in-kind time of the Prison Governor John Biggins and then Craig Thomas and senior staff such as Keith Jarvis who advised how best to set up the project. Also, Serco have funded the cost of employing two designers from Central Saint Martins as 0.5 FTE Serco prison employees to run the Design Textiles Studio, where Makeright run their Design Academy focus.

Staff from Sue Ryder attended various meetings at CSM in 2015 and 2016 with the research team and NOMS, HMP Wandsworth and HMP Thameside to help conceptualise the sustainability aspect of the project, and consider whether it was possible to turn turn their rags into anti-theft bags. They gave additional time in 2016 towards the creation of press release and ideas for the Make It Right exhibition. 

Jason Swettenham of National Offender Management Service gave time in-kind to mentor Gamman and Thorpe as to how the project could run within government prison industries and endeavoured to find them a prison to work with. He introduced them to Kenny Brown, Governor of HMP Wandsworth and attended many meetings to help set up this partnership, involved two senior prison staff in discussion as well as Cynthia Clottery who manages OLAS. He also was introduced to Andy Gregson of UK's Fab Lab in Central London who has advised the project about DACRC's idea to set up a resettlement creative unit nearby the prison for inmates. Even when HMP Wandsworth were unable to go forward with the project, Swettenham continued to mentor Gamman so that any learning from the project (subsequently delivered within the private prison context) will be shared with national prison industries, given he expressed a particular interest in Fab Lab developments. 

Carlotta Allum, of Stretch, a digital arts company made 4 videos of the Makeright project with inmates, using funds she had acquired from the National Lottery for such purpose. Central Saint Martins also funded GBP 1,200 of additional work in order to enable her to make videos of the volunteers on the project. See 'Inmates films' and 'Volunteers films' by Stretch Digital here: https://makerightorg.wordpress.com/images-and-videos/

Lotje Sodderland, an independent film producers also contributed significant time and made a 6-minute rough cut documentary free of charge for the the project that can be found here: https://makerightorg.wordpress.com/images-and-videos/. 

Janet Lee of BBC1 also gave 1 day's time to advise about the potential of making a documentary on Makeright.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Gamman and other staff from the Design Against Crime Research Centre worked as part of a collaborative team on the creation of design education teaching materials for HMP Thameside. The team also provided teaching time to run a workshop with inmates to build their future resettlement and employment prospects, whilst additionally helping to reframe inmates' previous behaviour in a positive manner by enabling them to engage with design processes and skills, and make a contribution to society through the design of anti-theft bags aimed at preventing crime. 

Both Gamman (PI) Thorpe (Co-I) are funded on the project but have contributed an additional 30 days in-kind labour each. 

Other Design Against Crime Research Centre staff have also provided their time in-kind to the project: 
Marcus Willcocks - 30 days 
Sarah Rhodes - 1 day 
Gamze Toylan - 3 days 
Emma Jonsson - proportion of her internship
Dani Davies - 20 days managing volunteers and other administrative support 

In addition, the Assistant Dean of Research, Janet McDonnell gave several days of her time to help train student volunteers to Makeright.

He also was introduced to Andy Gregson of UK's Fab Lab in Central London who has advised the project about DACRC's idea to set up a resettlement creative unit nearby the prison for inmates. Even when HMP Wandsworth were unable to go forward with the project, Swettenham continued to mentor Gamman so that any learning from the project (subsequently delivered within the private prison context) will be shared with national prison industries, given he expressed a particular interest in Fab Lab developments. 

Carlotta Allum, of Stretch, a digital arts company made 4 videos of the Makeright project with inmates, using funds she had acquired from the National Lottery for such purpose.

Cultures of Resilience is a two year University of the Arts London-wide initiative, the goal of which is to build a 'multiple vision' on the cultural side of resilience by putting together a set of narratives, values and ideas that are coherent in that they are all based on resilient systems, but in many other aspects they are very diverse. This presentation shared the learning from the prison project so far and discussed whether the approach to prison industries and the Makeright label could build resilience and positively impact (or unbox) on inmate experience.

This presentation raised interest in the project from staff across all 6 colleges at University of the Arts London and sparked an interesting discussion around the idea of teaching prisoners to become more resilient in the highly competitive and changing work places of the city, where expectations of employment are often not met amongst marginalised groups who in huge numbers fail to find legitimate employment and thus resort to crime.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e06e6517fdd3.11360357</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.culturesofresilience.org/wordpress</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop with inmates at Sabarmati Central Jail (Ahmedabad)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>550910D8-42E7-4130-94B9-CC0020BB7FB4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This intense 6 day co-creation workshop built on the UK Makeright projet and was titled 'Creative Design Thinking for Prison Industries: Co-creation of anti theft bags'.

The intention of the workshop was to show inmates how to co-design and co-create anti-theft bags to teach transferable skills and, in the long term, better communication, teamwork, conceptual design skills, pragmatic making skills and enterprise skills that will help them gain employability. Once developed and tested, we are considering proposing this model to the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) in India and other policy frameworks within prison industries for further implementation.

In terms of impact, the workshop developed some very interesting concepts. The feedback from the participants suggested a building of self-confidence and opening up of their minds. Overall we found that the workshop was a very good learning experience for all the inmates who participated and also brought in other aspects like peer learning, group work and realisation of their creative potential. Inmates who participated in workshop also got remission of 2 days each.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e06cfd16e4f0.80362855</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.makeright.org</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Magistrates' Association Retired Member Event</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8E73CE83-EF50-4D9B-AF18-EAA7A089BC26</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation of Makeright project at Magistrates' Retired Member Event on 5th December 2016 at the Marlborough Arms, London.

She gave the presentation 'What do creatives and criminals have in common', the purpose of which was to highlight and discuss the activities of prolific individuals who are self-directed and commit acquisitive crime as a sort of quasi 'trade' or 'profession' - a way to make a living. Such individuals may not 'work' in the traditional sense, but they are very active and entrepreneurial in terms of finding opportunities (Garwood, 2011; Felson and Clarke, 1998) to rob, swindle, thieve or drug deal etc. The argument was that art and design, as participatory creative processes, can help people who are imprisoned for committing crime to be more resilient in a society that denies them the opportunity to live through criminal means. This event prompted an engagement with the charity Stretch.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e06ed82a24c0.67765790</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.designagainstcrime.com/2015/04/28/the-misfit-economy-what-creatives-and-criminals-have-in-common/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation at HMP Thameside, September 2015 (London)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AD4B54F5-8435-450D-9EC4-131D5D2F4691</gtr:id><gtr:impact>On 8 September 2015, Gamman gave a presentation to the Governor of HMP Thameside and key senior management staff, to secure permission to run the Makeright project with the prison, instead of HMP Wandsworth who were unable to deliver classroom space or staffing support. 

The purpose of the meeting was to find out whether it would be possible to start to reframe prison industries as a location of a 'creative hub' at HMP Thameside, where new employment skills and opportunities could be developed and fostered. The aim of this presentation was to highlight how design can address the gap that currently exists between 'vocational' and 'educational' approaches to increasing employability amongst prisoners and with this aim, secure the go ahead to run the Makeright project at the prison.

Following on from the meeting and presentation, the Makeright Design Textiles Studio was set up at HMP Thameside in October 2015 to introduce analytical approaches associated with 'design-thinking' to prisoners ' in accessible and visual ways, so that learning could occur in pragmatic vocational contexts. Two CSM designers were appointed by HMP Thameside to work for the prison. The outcome of this was anti- theft bag products designed by prisoners, with an internal team at HMP Thameside capable of continuing the project when the research funding ends.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e06fab599c82.25693588</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.makeright.org</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop with inmates at HMP Thameside (London)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>51164E16-6AEA-4670-BFAC-0C2597658996</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A workshop was delivered to inmates at HMP Thameside over a 6 week period (starting on 12th October 2015) to introduce, in accessible and visual ways, analytical approaches associated with 'design-thinking' (Kimbell, 2009, 2011) to prisoners, so that learning could occur in pragmatic vocational contexts, producing a trial anti-theft bag design or accessory. The aim was to develop and test new opportunities for prisoners to engage in traditional prison industry activities, empowering them to learn additional skills (such as improved communication, collaboration, systemic reasoning and empathy) via the design of an anti-theft bag or accessory. 

Following the completion of the workshop, semi-structured feedback interviews were conducted with those inmates willing to be interviewed and still in prison (6), by a staff member (Erika Renedo) who had worked with the inmates throughout the project and delivered this as unpaid work. The findings are listed below. It is worth noting that the changes were predominantly more apparent in the inmates that were challenging and clearly disengaged at the beginning of the workshop (e.g. smoking, sleeping on table, lacking attention or disrupting others).

1. Pragmatic approach to thinking/making suit inmate learning styles? 
All interviewees agreed that the project was very good and few went on to report more specifically about how it differed from other work and education experiences, mentioning the reasons why they engaged with it uniquely.

2. Effect on communication:
Overall, participants showed an improved ability to communicate with one another and an improvement on presentation skills was evident to staff members. 

3. Effect on collaboration and systemic reasoning:
Overall, the ability to work with one another for the benefit of the project was observed and some inmates' behaviour clearly changed throughout the process. 

4. Effect on empathy:
Six participants who agreed to be interviewed reported an increased insight of the user's situation, therefore a potential victim of crime. Another common element in the interviews was a sense of pride for having done something useful, or for a good cause.

5. Improve the imprisonment experience so that imprisonment is less damaging;
All interviewees reported it was helpful, and most reported they thought the workshop should be longer than 4 weeks.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e072cd469ef5.05032443</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.makeright.org</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>79838</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>AHRC Large Grants: Disseminating &amp;quot;Design Thinking for Prison Industries&amp;quot; through Teaching Resources, Delivery Models and Training for Trainers</gtr:description><gtr:end>2018-02-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council (AHRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>AH/R00157X/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>3DCA8C2C-FC30-46C1-BA33-A70A33FC1316</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c2ad4a5d79c8.30445364</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-02-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>15000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Private company funding</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-10-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>SERCO</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>E15FC26D-8E35-4895-AD96-31C978DB218B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e15cdb8ffaf0.66174112</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-04-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>1. After running the Makeright project 6 times with over 85 inmates in the UK at HMP Thameside and with 25 inmates in India at Sabarmarti Jail, feedback received enabled us to conclude we had met our objectives and our educational resources did work, and enabled inmates in two countries to design an anti theft bag. Also so to engage with creative resources aimed at developing empathy, thinking and resilience skills, linked to the design process.

2. We subsequently introduced an art and design graduate volunteer system in the UK, after the first iteration of the course, so more designers would be available to mentor inmates - and give them more one-to-one support we saw they needed for learning through practice to be effective 
NB Learners could not deliver the practice unsupported and without delivering the practice they could not learn through it. To achieve this, we advertised at our own University and London design websites for volunteers. We received response and subsequently provided a day's training for those we took on, before taking them into the actual prison, where our training was delivered after security briefings. After the volunteers had completed attendance (several days each week) on one of the numerous 8-week Makeright course we ran , we gave them a day's debriefing, using their feedback to continually improve the course content and structure. 

3. We introduced certification processes for inmates and volunteers to recognize learning in the studio projects for all participants.

4. We launched the project to the public with the Make it Right exhibition at HMP Thameside in November 2016 attended by all prison inmates who expressed interest, families of Makeright learners and invited outside guests and press.
 
5. The above exhibition received strong press attention having launched the first range of bags designed by HMP Thameside inmates that were subsequently made up in quantity from recycled lorry tarp (provided by the food box delivery company Abel &amp;amp; Cole) by inmates at Kilmarnock prison. Designs displayed included: Tote Bag, Messenger Bag, Holster Bag, Arm Lock Bag and Laptop Case. See bag images here: https://makerightorg.wordpress.com/images/.
 
6. In the next phase of the Makeright project from February 2017 we plan to package up the Makeright teaching materials and empathy and enterprise &amp;quot;things&amp;quot; we have created to be disseminated at other prisons in 2017, in order to scale the value and impact of project.
 
7. We are reviewing how to ensure the inmates and Sue Ryder charity we are working with can continue to benefit from the economic value of the anti theft bags we have developed. We are currently reviewing how best to sell the outputs of this project, and reviewing whether or not to develop a social enterprise, so that if more prisons engage with developing bags for sale we can manage this activity more effectively, all to raise money for charity and esteem for inmates.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>2A6C3114-A098-4742-B151-C0B2F1986C0F</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56e1777dd16277.23232849</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Gamman &amp;amp; Thorpe (2015, 2016) identify this research project demonstrates:
1. That creative design teaching techniques can help involve inmates in new ways with skills learning.
2. That such creative techniques are effective in catalyzing the co design of a range of anti-theft bags in 2 countries from non-designers with little or no previous design experience.
3. That the project is valued by inmates who have given strong and positive feedback about its value.
4. That the design process in terms of the empathic and entrepreneurial learning it delivers to inmates is more (or as) significant as the objects that inmates created.
5. That the impact of the inmate stories and their designs are significant and news worthy and have led to several awards for excellence (project attracted a British Council INDIA-UK Excellence Award for Collaborations in Higher Education under the 'Innovative Partnerships' category and Sublime Magazine Badge - Best Design Initiative 2016) as well as attracted documentary film interest.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>1.
