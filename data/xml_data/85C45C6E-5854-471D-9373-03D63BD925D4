Together with a number of articles, it will represent both a further development from my research on Brazil's 'national reconstruction', which led to four monographs, and the foundation of a larger project on frontier modernisation in Latin America. My intimate knowledge of Brazil's southernmost state, Rio Grande do Sul, which forms part of the River Plate region and established a developmental and educational dictatorship modelled after Auguste Comte's positivist design, provide a solid basis for exploring ideas and institutions that guided state- and nation-building in other frontier regions. \n\nUruguay's 1904 pacification and ensuing transformation has always fascinated students of Latin America and beyond. The River Plate state became the first in the region to establish a liberal democracy with stable representative institutions and women's suffrage; largely nationalised public services and protected key industries; a cradle-to-grave welfare system; complete secularisation; and free education at all levels. Despite the backlash from the 1960s to 1980s, Uruguay today still ranks third in the U.N.'s Human Development Index for Latin America which measures the per-capita gross domestic product and factors like longevity and access to education. The initiation of this progressive course is attributed to Jos&amp;eacute; Batlle y Ord&amp;oacute;&amp;ntilde;ez's administrations (1903-7, 1911-15) and those who followed him, the batllistas. The President's shadow still looms over the country, comparable only to Get&amp;uacute;lio Vargas in Brazil or Franklin D. Roosevelt in the U.S. \n\nStarting with Arturo Ardao's revisionist theses, formulated in the 1950s, scholars have explained this transformation of an unstable nineteenth-century buffer state into 'Latin America's Switzerland' by Batlle's abandonment of the prevly prevailing positivism, embodied by educators Jos&amp;eacute; Pedro and Jacobo Varela, and embracement of Heinrich Ahrens's and Guillaume Tiberghien's philosophy of law, a Belgian derivation from Karl Christian Friedrich Krause's idealist philosophy. It aimed at an organic society, social reform, and moral regeneration. \n\nMy monograph will challenge the widely accepted notion of a political and ideological rupture after 1903. School reform, which was central to nation-building in Uruguay, started more than thirty years before Batlle's presidency, with the 'Reforma Vareliana', and was continued during his administration. While Comte had no input in this transformation, the more liberal strands of Herbert Spencer and John Stuart Mill did. The heirs of English positivism remained in charge of the influential normal schools until the end of Batlle's second term, while a new generation of philosopher-educators, headed by Carlos Vaz Ferreira, rose out of the crisis of the 'Reforma' in the 1890s and placed more emphasis on experience-based metaphysics. The co-existence and even merger of apparently opposing ideological paradigms, as with Krauso-Positivism, was nothing unique to Uruguay; it could also be observed in Argentina and found its expression in the polemics between reformers on both sides of the River Plate, from Varela and Teacher-President Domingo Faustino Sarmiento to batllistas and Radical leader Hip&amp;oacute;lito Yrigoyen. My book will uncover these interactions and contribute to a post-revisionist approach.\n\nThis research will examine hitherto unknown or neglected primary sources; draw on recent research in History, Philosophy, and Education; and engage with theoretical concepts of frontier modernisation, state formation, nation-building, and modernity. The monograph will explore, from new angles and in trans-national perspective, antecedents of the 'Reforma Vareliana', theideas shaping it, and the continuities in change which characterised batllista education policy.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The primary beneficiaries of this research will be SCHOLARS in the fields mentioned above. In its interdisciplinary and trans-national approach, the monograph will shed new light on Uruguay's late nineteenth and early twentieth-century frontier modernisation within the context of the greater River Plate. The project's focus on school reform, debated all over Latin America at the time, allows for comparisons with Sarmiento's Argentina or Porf&amp;iacute;rio D&amp;iacute;az's Mexico which figure prominently in university curricula. It is also an advantage that both Batlle and writer Jos&amp;eacute; Enrique Rod&amp;oacute;, a graduate from Varela's Elbio Fern&amp;aacute;ndez School, are well known to UNDERGRADUATE AND POSTGRADUATE STUDENTS who have taken courses in Latin American history and literature. Recent research on the 'reinvention of modernity' (Miller 2008) by post-1900 Latin American intellectuals has reignited interest in this key period, and a reassessment, in research and teaching, of the ideas that shaped the batllistas' rise to power is timely after the completion of Milton Vanger's trilogy on Batlle in 2010. \n\nSecondary academic outputs include three front-loaded articles to be submitted to 'Comparative Studies in Society and History', 'Journal of Iberian and Latin American Studies', and 'Latin American Research Review' (focussing on the ideological syncretism at Sarmiento's Escuela de Paran&amp;aacute;, the construction of nationhood in Uruguayan textbooks, and Montevideo's Institutos Normales de Se&amp;ntilde;oritas as agencies of nation-building, respectively) and a number of seminar and conference papers ('Transmissions' Conference at Newcastle in March 2011 and convening of a panel at the Society of Latin American Studies Conference in April 2012). While the former are particularly suited for classroom discussion, the latter will include postgraduate students.\n\nLatin America has once again attracted MEDIA interest. After the political shake-ups in Mexico and Venezuela and the elections to the presidency of a formn leader in Brazil, a Left-leaning bishop in Paraguay, the first Indian in Bolivia, and the first women in Chile and Costa Rica, a former tupamaro (urban guerrilla) governs Uruguay. For many, the region is associated with economic failure, political turmoil, and social exclusion. Uruguay, 'Latin America's Switzerland', is an excellent example to counter such generalisations and point to the region's pioneering role: not only was Uruguay one of the first countries to provide free education from primary school to university, a legacy of the 'Reforma Vareliana' and its aftermath; it also became, in 2009, the first nation to give a free laptop to each school child. Such examples and comparisons allow engaging the GENERAL PUBLIC and drawing it into historical explorations. Electronic media and popular publications, such as the 'BBC History' magazine, are excellent outlets.\n\nAnother channel to disseminate my research are SCHOOLS. I participated in a Road Show on Iberian Studies for the Hexham-Newcastle Catholic Partnership South. A two-day seminar for circa 100 secondary school teachers in Graz, Austria, in April 2011 will give me another opportunity to talk about Latin America and reach a large number of schools in Styria. I am currently exploring the possibility of seminars for U.K. academies (with J. Anthony, SSAT) and sharing teaching resources (JISC's www.humbox.ac.uk). \n\nThis project allows for the INTERNATIONALISATION OF U.K. RESEARCH IN LATIN AMERICA. For my field work, I have received unprecedented support from the Uruguayan government (becoming the first historian authorised to use school archives), SAEP, the Pedagogical Museum, and fellow academics. I am in regular contact with Uruguayan colleagues and, following the completion of my project, I plan a series of papers in the Museum and schools in Montevideo.

I would like to welcome PhD students in the CAPES-funded &amp;quot;sandwich&amp;quot; programmme (4-6 months of study abroad under my supervision) and colleagues who wish to give papers at the Centre for Latin American and Caribbean Studies at Newcastle. I also remain on the editorial councils of the History Series of EdiPUCRS and their journal 'Estudos Ibero-Americanos', which also involves reviewing. In the next REF cycle, I plan a collaborative research project (large grant application to AHRC or Leverhulme) on frontier modernization in Latin America, and I could imagine that PUCRS may want to take charge of a work package on the border and frontier region of Rio Grande do Sul.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>I have been in contact with colleagues from PUCRS for about two deacdes. More recently, while being at Oxford, Professor Fl&amp;aacute;vio Heinz from the Pontifical-Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul, a historian specialised in both positivism and frontier studies re. the Brazilian-Uruguayan border, contacted me, and we met in London and discussed our research plans, including my AHRC project. He read my book POSITIVISM GA&amp;Uacute;CHO-STYLE (2004), which prompted the current research cycle, and PUCRS University Press suggested translating this monograph into Portuguese, with a new foreword to the Brazilian edition. I invited him to Newcastle, where I was his host in a research seminar in 2013, and to a panel on 'Positivism and Education Reform in Latin America', which I convened at the 50-year conference of the Society for Latin American Studies in London in April 2014 (I was also Vice President of SLAS). I spoke on Uruguay, he on Brazil. I have remained in regular contact with Heinz, though he has moved on to the Universidade Rural de Rio de Janeiro. However, in the meantime collaboration many other historians at PUCRS had started. In 2016, I was invited as a Visiting Professor. As part of the programme, my book on positivism in Brazil was launched with a public lecture, I delivered a workshop for doctoral students from PUCRS and other universities of Rio Grande do Sul on my new book project on Uruguay, and talked to colleagues from the postgraduate programme in History, the PVC for Research, and the Head of the International Office.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited Research Seminar Paper, &quot;Castilhista Positivism and Get?lio Vargas's Estado Novo: Anatomy of a Brazilian Creed&quot;, Brazil Institute at King's College London</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2865BD3D-FA13-4A4C-8AA7-5089A13192B2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This well publicised paper looked into Rio Grande do Sul's positivist dictatorship (1891-1930), its national impact, and its links to the Greater River Plate area.

The Brazil Institute's seminars are attended by extremely knowlegable academics (among them my former teacher at Oxford, Prof. em. Leslie Bethell, now living in Brazil), committed postgraduate students, and highly interested members of the public. There was almost one hour of discussion. Professor Bethell then followed my invitation to a research seminar at Newcastle in March 2014 on the eve of a national conference of postgraduate students.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-1521313080.11832950cc002f2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.kcl.ac.uk/aboutkings/worldwide/initiatives/global/brazilinstitute/NewsandEvents/pastevents/Seminar-Series-2012-13.aspx</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Paper, Brazil Day conference, Newcastle University, November 2013</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B279C762-A226-4A5C-98EA-7953E584D425</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This academic conference, organized by Newcastle's Brazil Group, launched the Science Without Borders programme and, more generally, the institution's Brazil initiative.

I gave the opening talk on the development of higher education in Brazil from independence to the present day, which also focused on the role of positivism as the political philosophy of the Brazilian republic. There was a discussion afterwards.

Several Brazilian guests approached me later to say that the historical exploration was helpful to understand current travails.

During my visit, the university press launched my book 'Positivismo ao estilo ga&amp;uacute;cho' with a Public Lecture of one hour, which was widely advertised. The title of the lecture was 'Comtismo, castilhismo, varguismo: genealogia de um credo brasileiro' (Comtism, Castlhismo, Varguism: Genealogy of a Brazilian Creed). 

The book was originally published in English and had significant impact. As mentioned under 'collaboration', Professor Emeritus Joseph Love (University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign), the Nestor of research into positivist state-building in Rio Grande do Sul as part of a trans-regional transformation process, wrote in his foreword to the Brazilian edition: 'The following text by Jens Hentschke is a careful study of the influence of Comtean positivism in Brazil, focused on the case of Rio Grande do Sul and the careers of Julio de Castilhos and Getulio Vargas. The work reveals a mastery of a large literature on the subject in Portuguese and other languages. (...) Hentschke's nuanced work will be welcomed by students of Riograndense politics, but will also stand as a landmark in the study of positivism in Brazil for decades to come. All those who seek to explain Vargas's career will have to deal with Hentschke's argument.' My current project on philosophical polemics and nation-building in Uruguay from a transnational perspective, from Chile to Brazil, has, in many ways, grown out of this research, as I mention in my new foreword. The visiting professorship therefore also included a PhD workshop of six hour precisely on the Uruguay project.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58596a3e278795.44369803</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ncl.ac.uk/sml/news-events/news/item/jensrhentschkeasvisitingprofessoratpontifical-catholicuniversityofrio.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Contribution to a multi-media series of broadcaster German Wave on grandmothers under dictatorial regimes</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>93497F68-1DA9-4CB6-8512-0FF30FC0B087</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Trainee journalists from six countries on four continents interviewed their grandmothers who currently live in, or lived through, authoritarian regimes and explored questions of politics and cultural assimilation. The multi-media series, which emerged from there, also relied on historians' input. I gave a long interview by e-mail to the Brazilian journalist, focusing on the G. Vargas regime. It highlighted, among other things, its roots in Rio Grande do Sul, the normative ideas of Vargas and his prot&amp;eacute;g&amp;eacute;s, and his regime's attempts at cultural homogenisation. The material journalists can use in such a report is of course limited.

The secretary of the Sociedad Uruguaya de Historia de la Educaci&amp;oacute;n (SUHE; Uruguayan Society in the History of Education), Antonio Romero, informed me that my articles 'Artiguista, White, Cosmopolitan, and Educated...' (JLAS) and 'More than Queens of the Home...' (JILAS) have been included in the recommended bibliography of the course 'Historia de la Educaci&amp;oacute;n en el Uruguay' (History of Education in Uruguay) at the Faculty of Humanities and Educational Sciences at the Universidad de la Rep&amp;uacute;blica (University of the Republic) in Montevideo. My scholarly studies on textbooks and female teacher training during the positivist period (which prepared the ground for Uruguay becoming Latin America's first welfare state democracy) now inform undergraduate courses in Uruguay's leading educational institute. Given the high degree of originality and revisionist character of these publications, they have the potential to change students' perception of cultural nation-building in their country. Many of them will later teach in schools.
2. As outlined in the application, I had been invited by the Pedagogical Faculty of Styria and Association of Historians of Styria to conduct a two-day further education seminar on Brazil for secondary school teachers. It was part of a series on the BRIC powers. In eight lectures of one hour each, it was to provide an analysis of Brazil's historical development from pre-colonial times to the present, with a focus on the 19th and 20th centuries, some emphasis on education, and time for discusson. Given Brazil's and especially Rio Grande do Sul's involvement in the in the River Plate region from the colonial period to the Mercosur, historical comparisons with Uruguay could be included. Approximately 50 secondary school teachers from Styria attended this event as part of a high-profile further education seminar series. Since they teach in related areas, such as History, Geography, and Economics, it was intended to promote the dissemination of knowledge on Brazil, Russia, India, and China in schools and thereby to overcome an often eurocentric view in curricula.
3. In 2016, I carried out a one-day workshop for doctoral students of History, Politics, and Education from different universities of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, which focused on the topic of the monograph 'Philosophical Polemics, School Reform, and Nation-Building in Uruguay, 1865-1915' (see engagement). Given that little research on this topic has been done outside Uruguay and comparative, interdisciplinary, and transnational approaches to History are still underdeveloped in Brazil (and Latin America more generally), the workshop changed students' perspectives.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>AB447BA4-B042-4FE3-B806-22BA866CF69F</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>m-5201813415.812154de287c3a</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>453BF3F2-3A9D-4893-A166-EC65223C1156</gtr:id><gtr:title>Argentina's Escuela Normal de Paran&amp;aacute;
