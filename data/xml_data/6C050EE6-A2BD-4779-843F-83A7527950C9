Our communications, transport, finance, energy, commerce all rely on the continued availability of computers and networks. Ensuring the security of this critical infrastructure is a crucial priority for society.

By convening workshops in Cambridge and by attending relevant events elsewhere we will create further occasions for the cybersecurity academics to challenge the ideas of their peers and, beyond academia, to engage with the government and industry players whose assets are at stake.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This is not directly research but rather a support activity consisting of communication, dissemination and networking.

Cybersecurity (or lack thereof) has wide-ranging implications, from national security to industrial espionage to security of critical infrastructure such as communications, transport, utilities and banking: the underlying research ultimately affects all members of society.

Our action will engage not only the academic community but also relevant stakeholders in government and industry, to ensure that the cybersecurity research carried out at the University of Cambridge's ACE-CSR continues to be relevant and connected to real-world needs, and that those in a position to benefit from this research have awareness of what is being done and have the opportunity to suggest further desirable developments.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>39455</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Cambridge 2 Cambridge 2016</gtr:description><gtr:id>253974F4-7C15-44EB-883E-F85B69A2C193</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Establishing links between students and faculty at the two universities.

Students participated in a jeopardy-style &amp;quot;capture the flag&amp;quot; CTF competition. This was an inaugural event of a series which is planned to recur annually, which features a large trophy to be retained for the coming year by the winning institution. The event was pivotal in maintaining interaction between the ACE-CSRs, and inspiring students with an interest in cyber security to play their part in filling the looming skills gap in this sector. Following the day's competition, participants and their supervisors had the chance to network during a dinner at Churchill College. This event is quite impactful, being one of only very few occasions during the year that ACE-CSRs interact in this way.

Students will participate in a scenario-based &amp;quot;capture the flag&amp;quot; CTF competition.

This event is quite impactful, being one of only very few occasions during the year that ACE-CSRs interact in this way. It is already twice as big in its second year, suggesting that the heads of these institutions believe the event is certainly worthwhile and of benefit to students.

This workshop was open to students from the 13 Academic Centres of Excellence in Cyber Security Research (ACE-CSR). This workshop focused on Linux binary reverse-engineering and exploitation, taking students from identifying and exploiting simple buffer overflows using classic &amp;quot;shell code&amp;quot;, to defeating modern defences including non-executable stacks and address-space layout randomisation (ASLR) using Return Orientated Programming (ROP). The event was heavily subscribed, with more than 250 students in attendance. Following the event, a challenge problem was launched which required students to apply the skills they'd learned to deface a website by exploiting a setuid binary on the target system. To write a successful exploit, students needed to provide a working ROP chain which would overwrite a GOT entry and call a function from exec family in libc. Students from the University of Southampton achieved this goal in the first day the challenge was running, proving that they'd learned all the requisite skills during the preceding workshop. Students who attended this workshop will be well prepared for future capture the flag (CTF) competitions held between the ACE-CSRs.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c403a93f80b8.28844573</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Undergraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Cambridge2Cambridge (C2C) Cyber Security Challenge 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B0040915-D47E-41C1-A286-BB1012C2DCB8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As part of our collaboration with MIT described under &amp;quot;Collaborations and Partnerships&amp;quot;, we co-organised a two-part international cyber security challenge between MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL) and the University of Cambridge's Computer Laboratory.
