aftermath of war</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/P011543/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>First, the project will engage scholars working on the political economy of conflict and war to peace transitions. This includes researchers working on issues of violence (e.g. Christopher Cramer, Stathis Kalyvas, Teo Ballve), resources, statebuilding and political settlements (e.g. Jonathan Di John, James Putzel, Philippe Le Billon, Douglass North and Mushtaq Khan), and hybrid political orders (e.g. Volker Boege, Kate Meagher). The research will contribute to this literature by providing a comparative evidence base regarding the perpetuation of criminalised economies in peacetime and the complex dilemmas and trade-offs that exist between peacebuilding, development and counter narcotics efforts to tackle illicit economies. The research will be disseminated through publication in leading development and politics journals, through engagement with existing research networks (such as the Political Settlements Research Programme) and UK and international conferences.

Second, the research will benefit scholars working on drugs and other illicit economies, including Pierre-Arnaud Chouvy, Carolyn Nordstrom, Richard Snyder, Ko-Lin Chin, Francisco Thoumi. The research aims to redefine the field of drugs and development by generating an innovative, interdisciplinary framework for conceptualising the dynamics surrounding drug economies that combines political economy, livelihoods, gender, and public health analysis to understand the tensions that exist between counter-narcotics policies and concurrent efforts to address state fragility and poverty. The project is well-placed to disseminate research to audiences across different disciplines through the SOAS Violence, Conflict and Development research cluster, the new SOAS Corruption Centre, the LSE IDEAS International Drug Policy Project, the Centre for Research on Drugs and Health Behaviour (CRDHB) and The Centre for Health and Social Change (ECOHOST) (both hosted by the LSHTM).

Third, the research will strengthen recent borderland studies scholarship focused on how state margins are not simply reflective of power relations at the centre, but are often constitutive of new political and economic orders (e.g. Hastings Donnan, Thomas Wilson, Benedikt Korf, Timothy Raeymaekers, Paul Nugent, James Scott and Willem van Schendel). Research will strengthen this growing body of literature by demonstrating how a borderlands perspective can address the lack of sensitivity to space in much of the literature on war to peace transitions and statebuilding, which focuses predominantly on national-level political settlements. The research will engage beneficiaries by submitting publications to targeted journals including Geoforum and Journal of Borderland Studies, and through interacting with the Asian Borderlands Research Network, the Association for Borderland Studies and the African Borderlands Research Network.

Fourth, the project will provide an important contribution to the literature engaged with developing new research approaches for working in insecure terrain (e.g. Gutierrez-Sanin, Mansfield, Ko-Lin Chin). The research's integration of in-depth fieldwork, GIS spatial imagery and public health analysis will showcase methodological innovation that may then be adapted to other research initiatives in drugs and conflict-affected environments. These findings will be disseminated through the project's workshops and capacity building initiatives with UK-based and southern researchers.

The project aims to strengthen the links between UK and southern researchers in Afghanistan, Colombia and Myanmar across all of these areas of knowledge by establishing an extensive research network through the project's proposed Policy Lab and subsequent Research Consortium for Transforming Illicit Economies.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project aims to develop more sustainable and inclusive peace-building and counter-narcotics responses in Afghanistan, Colombia and Myanmar and other fragile regions across the world.

Illicit drug economies pose huge developmental challenges. They may finance and fuel violent conflict and drug use can have a devastating impact on communities. However, counter-narcotics strategies launched under the rubric of the 'war on drugs' have also had serious adverse impacts, increasing the impoverishment and vulnerability of marginalised communities that depend on drug cultivation and, by criminalising users, have undermined an effective public health response to drug use. 

If the development and welfare challenges facing drug-producing countries are to be addressed effectively a new approach is needed. This approach needs to be more evidence based and attuned to the distribution of costs and policy trade-offs associated with different interventions in drug-affected environments. There is a need for careful, empirically grounded research that reveals how particular policy combinations may, in particular settings, promote more inclusive and peaceable forms of development in drug affected environments. 

This project aims to promote a more developmental approach to drugs so that local, national and international counter-narcotic strategies are more sensitive to their health, livelihoods and gender dimensions. It aims to support NGOS, international policymakers and national governments to: (i) ensure greater alignment of counter-narcotics and peacebuilding activities around the UN Sustainable Development Goals; (ii) improve the health status and licit economic opportunities in drug-producing environments; (iii) reduce levels of violence related to counter-narcotic interventions; (iv) strengthen the capacity of government institutions and civil society groups to manage external assistance and counter-narcotics interventions. 

In order to achieve these aims, the project will:

1. Build a strong, policy-relevant evidence base to inform policies related to peacebuilding and illicit drug production in fragile and conflict-affected environments 
The project will develop a comprehensive body of evidence from three of the world's largest drug-producing countries to support policymakers and development agencies grappling with challenges of how to engage more effectively in fragile contexts. By developing an innovative interdisciplinary and mixed methods approach, this project will advance theoretical and empirical analysis leading to improved development and peacebuilding interventions. 

2. Strengthen the capacity of research organisations in Afghanistan, Colombia and Myanmar 
The project will develop a suite of training, collaboration and shared learning initiatives with research partner organisations to strengthen their capacity to generate rigorous, credible and high impact research, and to engage with local communities and national and international policymakers. These initiatives include an extensive annual 'Research Partner Training Programme' in the UK, as well as on the job training and mentoring and cross-country learning between the research organisations. This will strengthen the capacity of developing country partners to deploy advanced interdisciplinary research methods and to engage with major academic and policy debates around illicit drug economies. It will also encompass a series of distance learning and vocational training initiatives encompassing proposal writing, project management, and communication of results. 

3. Develop a 'Research Consortium for the Transformation of Illicit Economies'
The enduring institutional legacy of the project will be the creation of a Research Consortium, led by SOAS. This will provide a hub for methodological innovation, policy dialogue and advocacy and capacity-building training programmes for research organisations in developing countries and for policymakers.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>7328791</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/P011543/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>D640D1B8-B141-4DFC-BCD3-CEADD848A918</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>GCRF</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
