Despite the emphasis on the empowerment of children in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD), parental rights in education have tended to trump those of children and young people. There has also been some disparity with regard to the emphasis on the educational rights of children and young people with SEN/ASN in different parts of the UK, and competing understandings of the concept of autonomy. 

In both England and Scotland, new legislation aims to place the rights of children and young people with SEN and ASN on a par with those of their parents. In the light of this change, this research will consider whether we are witnessing a paradigm shift in the field of special and additional support needs analogous to that which occurred in state education in the 1980s and 1990s, when marketisation and consumerism attained a much higher profile. The research addresses important questions with regard to:

(1) the practical realisation of the rights of children and young people with different types of difficulty and in different social and geographical contexts;
(2) the way in which children and young people's rights sit alongside those of their parents;
(3) the measures which may be taken by schools and local authorities to promote the rights of children and young people. 

In considering the way in which the rights of children and young people with SEN/ASN are implemented in England and Scotland, the research will take account of changes in the wider social policy landscape, including the ongoing impact of devolution, growing diversity of governance arrangements in English schools and public sector austerity. 

A range of research methods will be used in this project, including analysis of policy, legislation and administrative data; a survey of local authority policy and practice in relation to the rights of children and young people; key informant interviews to elicit views on the factors which are likely to promote or inhibit the realisation of the rights of children and young people with SEN/ASN; qualitative work with children and young people and their parents/carers in home and school settings.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from the research?

The research will be of use to the following groups: (i) children and young people with SEN/ASN, their parents/carers and organisations working with them; (ii) policy makers including Scottish Government and Department for Education officials, local authority officers, managers of academies and free schools; (iii) teachers in different types of school; (iv) SEN/Disability Information, Advice and Support Services (also known as parent partnership officers); (v) mediation and advocacy workers; (vi) tribunal officials and lay members; (vii) other professional groups such as educational psychologists, social workers, speech and language therapists, paediatricians.

How will they benefit from the research?

The research will contribute to a better understanding of issues of autonomy and rights in relation to children and young people with SEN/ASN. The research is timely since, both north and south of the Border, legislation has recently been enacted with the objective of ensuring a much higher profile for children's rights and autonomy. In order for these legislative goals to be achieved, a better understanding is needed of the necessary conditions underpinning children's and young people's rights in different social and geographical contexts, and in relation to type of difficulty and age. Given that children and young people's rights in education have often been neglected, research findings should contribute to the enhancement of these rights both in the short term and the longer term. The UNCRC and the UNCRPD both recognise that the realisation of rights is necessary for social and economic well-being, and this research will contribute to UK compliance with the children's rights and disability rights agenda. The research will also contribute to the development of a wider public understanding of the ongoing impact of devolution across the UK particularly in relation to education and children's rights. 

For staff working on the project, professional skills will be developed in the use of film-making as a knowledge exchange tool, as well as in the involvement of children and young people in all aspects of the research process. Researchers at an early point in their careers will be helped in the development of research and writing skills. They will develop their publication profile, present at conferences and knowledge exchange events and build professional networks.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-08-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>428763</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/P002641/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4511FB20-8392-418E-809D-7701FACC03C9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Law &amp; legal studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F9D6F76D-4C6C-4E36-8E06-D471DED87098</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B75590D5-E385-45F1-B6D0-CC3EDEFDE67D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Socio Legal Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D2DE952A-D3A4-42AA-B3D0-37E979EBA723</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology of Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
