We have already shown that this occurs in meadow plant communities in England (Silvertown et al. 1999. Nature 400: 61-63) and have now demonstrated the same phenomenon also occurs in fynbos. This is an important discovery because it shows that quite different plant communities (with almost no plant families in common) are structured by the same fundamental mechanism. It is also surprising because fynbos habitats are fire-driven ecosystems that burn and regenerate naturally after fire and one might expect this disturbance to over-ride any fine-scale hydrological influence. Fires occur in the S Hemisphere summer (Nov - Apr) with a periodicity of 15 - 50y, but are unpredictable. A fire has just occurred at one of our field sites and we wish to take advantage of this unpredicted event to set-up a long-term experiment to test two hypotheses: A. Within-plot hydrological differences influence the structure of communities by controlling seedling establishment after fire, B. Seedling response to hydrology is influenced by root competition. The hypotheses will be tested by extracting soil monoliths (blocks of soil) with intact soil seed banks from different locations along the known hydrological gradient and transferring these to wetter and drier locations within the site. Control monoliths will be dug up and replaced in their original locations. A root barrier treatment (with controls) will be used in the experiment to determine the effect of root competition on plant performance along the soil moisture gradient. If hypothesis A is correct, then seedling mortality ought to be greater in translocated monoliths than controls and the ultimate species composition of monoliths should be influenced by their post-fire location on the hydrological gradient. Hypothesis B will be supported if competition treatments alter the effect of hydrology on distribution. Results will be incorporated into a spatial model that will be used to determine whether the effects measured in the experiment are sufficient to generate the patterns of species distribution observed late in post-fire succession. The sensitivity of the model outputs to a range of patterns of seed dispersal and changes in hydrology will be tested.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-02-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-03-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>45546</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>They have been presented in conferences and publications.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>3C41D10D-F21E-4B9E-8BFF-28E43532E351</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>544917e7302537.12814413</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>? Background and aims Species in plant communities segregate along fine-scale hydrological gradients. Although this phenomenon is not unique to fynbos, this community regenerates after fire and therefore provides an oppor- tunity to study the ecological genesis of hydrological niche segregation.
? Methods Following wildfires at two field sites where we had previously mapped the vegetation and monitored the hydrology, seeds were moved experimentally in .2500 intact soil cores up and down soil-moisture gradients to test the hypothesis that hydrological niche segregation is established during the seedling phase of the life cycle. Seedling numbers and growth were then monitored and they were identified using DNA bar-coding, the first use of this technology for an experiment of this kind.
? Key Results At the site where niche segregation among Restionaceae had previously been found, the size of seedlings was significantly greater, the wetter the location into which they were moved, regardless of the soil moisture status of their location of origin, or of the species. Seedling weight was also significantly greater in a competition treatment where the roots of other species were excluded. No such effects were detected at the control site where niche segregation among Restionaceae was previously found to be absent.
? Conclusions The finding that seedling growth on hydrological gradients in the field is affected by soil moisture status and by root competition shows that hydrological niche segregation could potentially originate in the seed- ling stage. The methodology, applied at a larger scale and followed-through for a longer period, could be used to determine whether species are differently affected by soil moisture.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This was a pilot project and a follow-up is required.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5E7ECC93-F8FC-4139-8BF1-C2CE9782528B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544918a069ca70.67559285</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>53299E8F-B730-4C9A-A8FC-A4C7AB428242</gtr:id><gtr:title>Experimental investigation of the origin of fynbos plant community structure after fire.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Annals of botany</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e1bfb30f17969a422dbbf35d7eca274d"><gtr:id>e1bfb30f17969a422dbbf35d7eca274d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Silvertown J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0305-7364</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d045045c3f0537</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/H000801/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>1A1A6805-9DC4-4BCE-BC70-9F2AA4FD093B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ecol, biodivers. &amp; systematics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F4786876-D9A9-404D-8569-BBC813C73074</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Community Ecology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
