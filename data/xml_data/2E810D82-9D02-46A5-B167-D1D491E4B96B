The plays were translated directly from the English by Isaac Salkinson, a Lithuanian Jew who had converted to Christianity, and form part of an ideologically loaded Jewish Enlightenment initiative to establish a modern European-style Hebrew literature in Eastern Europe at a time when the language was still almost solely a written medium prior to its large-scale revernacularisation in Palestine. Salkinson's translations are significant in several respects. Firstly, they are the earliest Hebrew versions of some of the world's most renowned dramatic works, and are therefore a key resource for the study of Hebrew translation in Eastern Europe and the origins of Modern Hebrew literature. Secondly, they paved the way for, and thus provide valuable literary and historical contextualisation for, all subsequent Hebrew Shakespeare translations. Thirdly, they offer an important and hitherto unexplored perspective on Shakespearean translation worldwide, as they constitute some of the sole examples of renditions into a largely unspoken language. Fourthly, the translations can serve as an instructive case study for specialists in translation theory in that Salkinson adopted a highly Judaising style resulting in a target text very culturally distinct from its English counterpart. This domesticating approach, to which Salkinson adhered despite his conversion to Christianity, is consistent with the dominant Jewish Enlightenment translatorial philosophy which is itself heir to a long tradition of Judaising Hebrew adaptations of European literary works dating back to the medieval period. However, despite their great significance no comprehensive study of these remarkable translations has yet been conducted. Moreover, the Hebrew plays themselves remain largely inaccessible to readers, as they have not been reissued in a modern edition and are located in only a small number of university libraries, often confined to Rare Books collections. I shall make Salkinson's pioneering work available to a wide readership via the project's main output, a book-length volume containing an introduction to the position and use of Hebrew in the Jewish Enlightenment and a biographical sketch of the translator, followed by a presentation of the two Hebrew plays alongside the English originals with a running line-by-line commentary. In order to analyse Salkinson's translatorial aims and techniques with a focus on the Judaising elements in his work, the commentary will make reference to current theory on domesticating translation; primary Jewish sources in Hebrew and Aramaic such as the Hebrew Bible, Mishnah, Talmuds, and Zohar; and the nineteenth-century Schlegel-Tieck German Shakespeare rendition. Topics to be addressed include the neutralisation of Christian and classical references; the insertion of biblical phrases and Jewish cultural motifs; and the Hebraisation/Aramaicisation of Latin and French linguistic elements. The volume will conclude with a thematic synopsis of the translation techniques discussed in the running commentary. This study, which has been accepted subject to peer review for publication by UCL Press in print and Open Access form, will fill a significant gap in the fields of Shakespeare translation and Eastern European Hebrew literature. In addition to the volume, I shall organise a major three-day international conference on Shakespeare and the Jews; hold a lecture on Salkinson's translations at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst; produce a student/staff performance of Ram veYa'el; and give a series of talks to A Level English students and teachers at three Jewish schools in the London area in order to raise awareness of the work among the wider public.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Although traditionally in the UK Shakespeare has been regarded as inextricably linked to the English language, in recent years there has been a growing awareness of Shakespeare as an intercultural literary figure and there is now considerable public interest in international productions of the plays. This phenomenon is evidenced not only by the popularity of non-English-language performances hosted by British theatres such as Shakespeare's Globe and the Barbican as part of their regular seasons, but also by the huge success of the 2012 World Shakespeare Festival, which showcased many multilingual performances including the Globe to Globe Festival wherein the entire canon was presented in a range of languages. This interest gained additional momentum with the celebrations of the 450-year anniversary of Shakespeare's birth in 2014 and is likely to grow further still with the planned commemorations of the 400-year anniversary of his death in 2016. Given this, my research will have particular appeal for three distinct groups of non-academic beneficiaries. Firstly, it will be of benefit to theatre professionals (including actors, directors, and dramaturges) both in the UK and internationally, especially those based at institutions who engage with global Shakespeare such as Shakespeare's Globe Theatre, which frequently stages productions in languages other than English and hosts public talks on Shakespeare in translation. Secondly, it will appeal to the theatre-going public with an interest in multilingual Shakespeare. Thirdly, it will be of relevance to A Level English students and teachers in Jewish schools which include intercultural themes in their Shakespeare curriculum. I aim to reach these groups through my student/staff production of Salkinson's Ram veYa'el and international conference, which will be open to the public, and a series of talks in London Jewish secondary schools. These events will provide rare opportunities to engage with this fascinating and little-known example of global Shakespeare.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>97424</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Lecture on the first Hebrew Shakespeare translations at Hasmonean Boys' School, London</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>23DBD39A-DA6A-4AB5-B537-606AFE7C4F45</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The event was a presentation to approximately 10 English A Level students and their teacher at a London Jewish secondary school on the subject of my research (the first Hebrew Shakespeare translations).

Differing significantly from the original English, Salkinson's translations are replete with biblical, rabbinic, and medieval Hebrew textual references and reflect a profoundly Jewish religious and cultural setting. The bilingual edition produced during the period of the award includes the full text of the two Hebrew plays alongside a complete English back-translation with a commentary examining the rich array of Hebrew sources and Jewish allusions that Salkinson incorporated into his work. The edition is complemented by an introduction to the history of Jewish Shakespeare reception in Central and Eastern Europe; a survey of Salkinson's biography including discussion of his unusual status as a Jewish convert to Christianity; and an overview of his translation strategies. The book makes Salkinson's pioneering work accessible to a wide audience.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>My findings are being published in an Open Access monograph entitled The First Hebrew Shakespeare Translations: A Bilingual Edition and Commentary (UCL Press, June 2017).
