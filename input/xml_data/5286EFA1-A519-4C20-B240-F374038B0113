Landscape also offers ways to draw greater social, economic and environmental benefits from heritage. We will uncover the natural connections that exist between the domains of landscape and heritage, both in research and policy terms. In the face of significant environmental and social change, seeing heritage through the lenses of landscape allows heritage to act as a solution not a problem. CHeriScape will work in the interlocking spaces between the two Council of Europe conventions - the European Landscape Convention and the Faro Convention on the Value of Cultural Heritage to Society - to demonstrate how they align and support each other. A third aspect of our thinking will be based on the ESF/COST Science Policy Briefing 'Landscapes in a Changing World'. Our method is to arrange five large conferences, to which we will invite keynote speakers and also policy makers and stakeholders, and to produce from them a suite of products aimed at strengthening the influence that landscape and heritage can have on both high-level and local environmental and social policy. To do this we have brought together a small but highly experienced and expert consortium, with a range of disciplines including some not normally associated with heritage (because landscape is one of the most interdisciplinary of fields of study). We are also acutely aware that landscape falls simultaneously into all three categories of heritage defined by the JPI; it is at one and the same time tangible and intangible, and increasingly it is being experienced by many people through digital means. CHeriScape will therefore also use this rich concept of 'landscape' as a laboratory to closely examine the nature and potential of 'heritage'.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>45125</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>CHeriScape IV Conference (Madrid) - Facing Global Change through Landscape</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>51A07110-5A28-4027-AAA3-BE683B9866C5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The fourth CHeriScape conference looked outwards towards the major environmental and social changes currently seen to be operating at global level, and at how spatial planning and sustainable and economic development strategies can interact with these through the lens of landscape.

The conference examined how demographic change, changing aspirations and identities, and lifestyle choices contribute to the global challenges, and therefore how (as the SPB on landscape, and both the Florence and Faro Conventions claim) they can offer answers to those challenges as well as calling for protection against them. The idea of landscape as heritage resonates with the need to give new life to cultural landscapes by finding them new functions and values, ideas central as well to the sustainability of heritage.

The mental landscapes we inhabit are increasingly digital as well as remembered; new media is changing how people interact and even how they think, perhaps in a way similar to how landscape and heritage governed lives in the past. This digital way of perceiving landscapes is just another turn to the ELC definition of landscape as areas 'perceived by people'. Perhaps it narrows 'real world' experience, but it also expands and stretches horizons. Landscape is no longer, if it ever was, only the local, the seen or walked/worked in; people 'possess' distant landscapes that are nevertheless familiar, and never more easily than through 'new' virtual media. These still-emergent technologies could enable increased democratic engagement with landscape heritage and with landscape futures. Our concluding conference thus explored how futures that grow from the past can be explored and imagined through new forms of heritage and landscape representations, and thus how present and future landscapes can be shaped and constructed.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c7ecf64deb57.43932242</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.cheriscape.ugent.be/conferences/conference-5/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>&quot;Cultural Landscapes: what for?&quot; - Demonstrating the social impact of our work - Session at LAC 4, Uppsala, September 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>271611EF-063D-41BF-A13F-9CDD582F829D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Conference session at Landscape Archaeology Conference IV, Uppsala, September 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c7fc68101669.97704597</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2012,2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>CHeriScape European policy briefing</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>355953E9-9AAD-483E-9E71-EB1D702D987E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A policy briefing meeting for around 10 invited participants from the European Commission (DG Research) and the JPI Cultural Heritage and Global Change was held at the FWO (Flemish Research Council) in Brussels in November 2016.

Their 'partnership' offers exciting new ways to influence decision-making from the highest level to the most local in relation society's global challenges. Heritage and Landscape is a golden combination to be
cherished for the sound future of Europe's cultural identity. It can also help ensure a sound socioenvironmental future. Because it is founded on socially and culturally embedded
understandings of the challenges facing society, it offers cultural solutions to cultural problems.

A key question to answer is how far we have progressed towards the ideal of integrated landscape research, as promoted by the ESF/COST Science Policy Briefing on 'Landscape in a Changing World'. The conference included a wide range of landscape disciplines, and to many 'different' scientific and humanities-based responses approaches to landscape (for example management, protection, recording, representation, imagination, embodiment, memory, identity-creation), in order to connect them, despite their distinctive academic languages, premises and assumptions, on the common ground of landscape. What are the specific differences between the different approaches to landscape? What can heritage-based landscape researchers learn from other disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, ecology, environmental science to move towards sustainable action on a landscape as heritage level?

The conference explored different national and disciplinary traditions, identities and through dialogue between researchers, policy makers, local people and other stakeholders illuminate better ways for the European common cultural heritage to help address current and future the major challenges at all policy levels.

The conference covered three themes.
Session 1: Landscape and Heritage - concepts and ideas
Session 2: ELC and Faro interconnections and synergies
Session 3: Landscape as heritage in mainstream policy

The key mechanism for impact was through active involvement of stakeholders from many different domains (academic, professional, third sector, policy) in the five project conferences. The conferences explored the overlapping territories of two Council of Europe conventions, the European Landscape Convention (Florence, 2000) and the Faro Convention on the Value of Cultural Heritage to Society (Faro, 2005), in particular though landscape as a tool to develop the vision of the Faro Convention. It also follows the call of the ESF/COST Science Policy Briefing, 'Landscape in a Changing World', to use the idea of landscape as a field of integrative interdisciplinary action for 'Bridging Divides, Integrating Disciplines and Serving Society'. The conference participants uncovered the connections between landscape and heritage in both research and policy. The strong relational and integrating character of the landscape concept offers a multi-facetted perspective, including a vital and dynamic spatial or territorial framework, a long-term chronological, through-time framework and perhaps most importantly, a perceptual, experiential and shared social framework. We explored how far the lens of landscape allows heritage to provide solutions in the face of significant environmental and social change, rather than being seen as a problem or obstacle, as was sometimes claimed to be in the past.

Through the participants' discussions, each of the five conferences produced Policy and Science briefing notes related to the conference theme (available from our website: http://www.cheriscape.ugent.be/conference-summary-leaflets/). At the final closing workshop, our participants produced the Key Messages from CheriScape, 'Cultural Solutions for Cultural Problems', http://www.cheriscape.ugent.be/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/CHeriScape-Key-Messages.pdf.

Following a joint policy briefing attended by representatives from the JPI Cultural Heritage and Global Change and the European Commission in Brussels (at which the first draft of our Key Messages were presented), our perspectives are being used to inform science and heritage policy, as represented for example through the developing programmes of these two organisations.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>4D850DA3-8E67-4795-AC9E-08AEF80B645E</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54631ac9732875.97418681</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The key messages from the project have been summarised and are presented on the project website: http://www.cheriscape.ugent.be/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/CHeriScape-Key-Messages.pdf

Heritage and of landscape are two sides of a coin. Cultural heritage is an essential foundation of landscape, which frames everyone's lives, and landscape provides ways to understand heritage better and value, used and connect it to modern life. Heritage and landscape reflect people's history, identity, memories, lifestyles and aspirations, and important ways in which people connect with their environment and interact socially and intellectually. They are both local and universal, personal and collective. Bringing them increases their social, economic and environmental values. For a world facing anthropocentric environmental degradation, demographic pressure and social changes, the currently-dominant policies based on economic market forces or eco-environmental solutions are on their own insufficient. To complement them - to be a counterweight - a strong cultural and societal dimension is required in decision making and planning. The ideas discussed at the CHeriScape conferences promote such a people-centred culturally-sensitive approach: in other words, a CHeriScape approach offers cultural solutions to culturally-created problems.

The project's aim was to develop key messages through its five interdisciplinary, participatory conferences. This was successfully achieved, in addition to a sixth workshop meeting, an international policy briefing, and an active network that has organised sessions at a series of other international conferences.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Through our website, policy briefings and other dissemination activities, the results are feeding into landscape and research policy at national and international levels, for example informing the developing approach of other projects funded through the JPI Cultural Heritage and Global Change.

The text and images of key documents and presentations from our five conferences are available (and will continue to be made available) via the project website, www.cheriscape.eu</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C479F0EA-868C-4A99-B8B7-76672908D0EA</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54631d3b2cc975.44074489</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Energy,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.cheriscape.eu</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7F940764-916A-4A54-B7D7-2279EE6D6EC2</gtr:id><gtr:title>CULTURAL HERITAGE THROUGH TIME: A CASE STUDY AT HADRIAN'S WALL, UNITED KINGDOM</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>ISPRS - International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a2c133e7b1fa4a3e1fa0cd20c4f8f491"><gtr:id>a2c133e7b1fa4a3e1fa0cd20c4f8f491</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Fieber K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5aa6c3bfd80dd7.01727105</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>26F72D97-8184-4DE5-A8BC-254E5A4FEFDA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Introduction: Seeing Heritage through the Lens of Landscape - New Approaches in Landscape Archaeology Based on the Fusion of Heritage and Landscape</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/76c4913488ba3186c2dda1cae29cf284"><gtr:id>76c4913488ba3186c2dda1cae29cf284</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Fairclough G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c7fa4e371077.15633666</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8111A0F2-E3B7-472C-93A0-E12F6B992950</gtr:id><gtr:title>Changes and continuities in a Mediterranean landscape: a new interdisciplinary approach to understanding historic character in western Catalonia</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Landscape Research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/3caab22aad47c553636b7980fd7e75a7"><gtr:id>3caab22aad47c553636b7980fd7e75a7</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Turner S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5aa6c3bfb37453.30669745</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/L503976/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
