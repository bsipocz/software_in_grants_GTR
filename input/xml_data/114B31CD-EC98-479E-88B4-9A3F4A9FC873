&lt;p>A major contribution of this project is the construction of a harmonised long-term sectoral dataset for several countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. This dataset will consist of time series information on value added in international prices and employment for ten broad economic sectors for the period from 1960 to 2010. With this new dataset, the researchers will identify countries in which structural change has been growth enhancing as well as countries in which structural change has reduced economic growth. Comparisons with other developing regions of the world will be made through similar datasets already available for Asia and Latin-America. Using the results of this analysis, the researchers will identify specific policies and events that have influenced the process of structural change.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The researchers will also examine the links between urbanization, food prices and structural change by using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods including in-depth case studies.&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We recognize that national governments, the domestic and international private sector, international development organizations and donors, and the wider academic community will each be able to uniquely benefit from our research. As McMillan and Rodrik (2011) have stated, structural change that shifts labor from sectors with lower-than-average productivity to manufacturing or other high-productivity sectors would provide a significant boost to real incomes. As it is crucial that our research results reach a range of audiences, stakeholders, and actors that can impact development policy, we have thus designed our research agenda with primary consideration for the potential to reach a wide variety of actors in the development sphere. For government audiences, our research will provide a better understanding of the determinants of structural change and productivity growth, allowing governments the ability to design and implement more effective policy that is directed addressed by our research questions. Domestic and international private sector actors will also be able to benefit due to our primary data sources in the business community. International development organizations and donors focused on growth and poverty reduction will have full access to our results as tools for refining their programs and practices. The wider academic community is another important audience for this research. They have a strong influence on the national policy debate and can serve as collaborators and partners in our research.
We will ensure the maximum opportunity to benefit from our research by producing several types of outputs and utilizing a range of communication tools and environments. Seminars, conferences, workshops, published materials, websites, and social media will all be critical to reach this goal. Eleven percent of our total budget has been allocated for these efforts. To promote initial awareness of the research and its implications, our first planned conference communication will be at the annual conference organized by the African Center for Economic Transformation (ACET), a project partner, involving authors of ACET case studies the principal investigator and the co-investigators, which will take place in the Spring of 2012 in Ghana in conjunction with ACET's launch of its African Economic Transformation Report. We have workshops planned for the country case studies that will allow us to present our approach and results throughout the duration of the project. We will promote the potential impact on the private sector through dissemination of our policy briefs and encouraging private sector participation in our conferences and workshops. 
We have a multi-pronged approach to maximizing the potential of the internet for collaboration and dissemination of results. First, we will take advantage of blogs run by our co-investigators, partner networks and websites such as ReSSAKS and Project Syndicate that are established sources for policymakers and researchers, as well as various new media tools to communicate to our target audiences before, during, and after the research term.In order to further communicate our research and results, several steps have been planned to produce and distribute materials for journals, institutions, and media organizations. From each research question outlined in Section 3, a paper for top-tier publication will be produced with corresponding policy briefs that will allow for dissemination to wider audiences. The resulting country case studies will provide a basis for specific policy recommendations for each country, and corresponding firm-level studies will be combined with these country studies for special-issue online journal publication and for use as classroom material. Finally, we understand the important role that media organizations play in policymaking, and we will proactively communicate with these organizations via press releases and invitations to conferences and interviews with researchers.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-04-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>854781</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>DFID Grant on Structural Change: Impact

Impact 4: We made newly available data to researchers working on structural change and economic growth.
Existing analyses of economic transformation in Africa has been hampered by the reliability and availability of data on output and productivity trends by sector. The newly constructed Africa Sector Database is a major step forward, providing long-run output and employment data for eleven African countries since 1960.

The Africa Sector Database is freely and publicly available on the website of the Groningen Growth and Development Centre, which hosts various complementary datasets. The Africa Sector Database attracts considerable attention, among others visible in the substantial and increasing number of page visits and downloads of the dataset. On average, in 2015 the database was visited 50 times each week of the year.

This hypothesized relationship became known as the Kuznets Curve, or inverted-U. One of the papers, by Temple and Ying, examines whether the mechanism proposed by Kuznets will generate a Kuznets curve, but using modern methods to investigate the question in greater generality. Temple and Ying present a dynamic general equilibrium model with heterogeneous workers, occupational self-selection and selective migration, and calibrate the model to survey data for Malawi.

They show that structural transformation raises living standards unevenly. As development proceeds, the movement of workers from agriculture is associated with rising wage inequality, rather than a Kuznets curve. The increase in sectoral wage inequality is pronounced for agriculture. At the same time, structural transformation is associated with major reductions in rural poverty, and eventually in urban poverty.

A second paper, by Temple, Ying and Carter, looks at the effects of international transfers on investment and growth. For many developing countries, international transfers are now a significant source of income. These transfers include official development aid, private charitable donations, and personal remittances. The paper uses dynamic one-sector and multi-sector models to isolate conditions under which transfers could promote growth and structural transformation. Although transfers bring welfare benefits, the effects on investment and growth are modest under isoelastic utility; where investment is profitable, it would be undertaken even in the absence of transfers. Larger effects on growth and sectoral structure emerge when preferences take the Stone-Geary form, since then low investment can co-exist with high returns to investment.

There is a large body of evidence suggesting that the intertemporal elasticity of substitution (roughly, how willing consumers are to move consumption between different points in time) is increasing in the level of consumption, and hence Stone-Geary preferences could be relevant to the analysis of saving and investment decisions. The paper shows that, with Stone-Geary preferences, it becomes much easier to make the case for large investment and welfare benefits of transfers, such as remittances and foreign aid. This can be contrasted with earlier work, such as that of Obstfeld, which had concluded that transfers would have comparatively modest effects on aggregate investment.


Existing analyses of economic transformation in Africa are hampered by the reliability and availability of data on output and productivity trends by sector. The Africa Sector Database is a step forward, providing long-run output and employment data for eleven African countries since 1960. The Africa Sector Database consists of data for eleven Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries for the period 1960-2010 that together account for about 70 per cent of SSA GDP. It covers countries from East Africa (Ethiopia, Kenya, and Tanzania), West Africa (Ghana, Nigeria, and Senegal), and Central and Southern Africa (Botswana, Malawi, Mauritius, South Africa and Zambia). It includes annual data on gross value added at current and constant prices from 1960 to 2010. It also includes data on persons engaged, which allows the derivation of labour productivity (value added per worker) trends. The database covers the ten main sectors of the economy as defined in the International Standard Industrial Classification, Revision 3. Together these ten sectors cover the total economy. Data and detailed documentation of sources and methods are publicly and freely available at www.ggdc.net/asd.

In another paper we put recent growth and structural transformation in eleven Sub-Saharan African countries in historical and international perspective. During the early post-independence period, resources were reallocated to manufacturing activities with high productivity growth. Structural change stalled in the mid-1970s. When it resumed in the 1990s, workers mainly relocated to distributive trade services. Productivity levels in these activities were higher than in agriculture, enhancing overall economy performance. But services productivity growth was sluggish and increasingly falling behind the world frontier. These patterns are also observed in Latin America, but not in Asia.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings could be of interest to policy-makers, especially when formulating policies relevant to remittances and foreign aid.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>99025EEA-EBE7-4D7D-A36E-2C55645B5D09</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54e34b168f5f78.99002179</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.ggdc.net/asd</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>21E043DF-12F4-45FE-997B-286C762A80A2</gtr:id><gtr:title>Transfers and Transformations: Remittances, Foreign Aid, and Growth</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2447e06709ca7b87a40e49efec9fcd46"><gtr:id>2447e06709ca7b87a40e49efec9fcd46</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Temple, J.
