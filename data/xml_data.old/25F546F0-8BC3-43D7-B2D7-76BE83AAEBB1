However, an underexplored aspect of sport provision and policy is the value of informal and lifestyle sport [LS] such as skateboarding, parkour and surfing, particularly in promoting active lifestyles. Whereas participation in traditional competitive sport is steadily declining, informal and LS have seen increasing popularity amongst a broadening range of consumers, and across different national contexts. Recognising the central role that informal sport and leisure plays in the community and the economy, this seminar series will provide a timely opportunity to examine the impact, and potential social and political benefit, generated by informal and non-institutionalised sport in general (from practices like yoga, to dance and street-sports) and LS in particular. The seminars will be underpinned by theoretical insights about the emergence, significance and cultural politics of LS cultures. Recognising the multitude of experiences, practices and communities that constitute the informal sporting landscape, the seminars will bring together research from a range of disciplinary backgrounds, theoretical perspectives, and fields of study. 

The six seminars will provide a context for lively debate of current research, and future challenges, bringing together academics, policy makers, practitioners, creating dialogue between often disparate academic disciplines and user communities. They will assess the most current and relevant research in these fields, and integrate with end-users perspectives. They will develop new networks and approaches to issues, and provide a platform for a new generation of researchers to challenge current research agendas. The 6 seminars will explore the following themes: 1 (Brighton): Mapping the policy context; 2 (Brunel, London); Institutionalisation and regulation; 3 (Brighton); Lifestyle sport in School and the PE curriculum; 4 (Bournemouth); New participants in lifestyle sports: Current trends and strategies for Change; 5 (Brighton); Bodies out of place? The racialisation of informal sporting spaces; 6 (Brighton); Assessing future directions. 

To encourage and gain insights from policy makers and young researchers we have organised funding across all seminar sessions for these groups. In doing so we aim to provide a critical, yet policy relevant, forum in which the role of informal LS can be better understood. The findings will be timely and relevant to wide-ranging academic, as well as non-academic, audiences who are concerned with understanding the role informal sport can play in relation to community, culture, health and economy; and for providing inclusive and relevant opportunities for sport and leisure provision. The South East, in which most of the seminars are based, is a particular hub of activity in this area, including relevant projects such as those based on the South Downs National Park, and coastal recreation projects. 

These seminars seek to engage with, and promote an inter-disciplinary academic agenda. It will contribute to a broader policy discussion about the role of informal sport, specifically in debates around health and well-being, community and citizenship, inclusion and belonging, in private and public spaces. Our dissemination plan, including a lifestyle sport festival, is designed to target a wide range of relevant audiences beyond the seminar participants. We will provide an impetus for a broader public debate about the changing value and meaning of informal sport. To this end we will produce a multi-disciplinary edited collection of papers, a themed issue of an international refereed journal, an interactive website with podcasts, and produce press releases targeting relevant media.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Impact summary 

This seminar series intends to put informal sport and leisure higher up various policy agendas and to discuss ways they can be utilised more effectively, particular in cross-cutting policy agendas. The seminar series therefore has relevance to a wide range of non-academic beneficiaries, and from the outset we have considered who would benefit, and how to involve and disseminate to these interested parties. We have also had conversations with end-users to help formulate the seminar proposal including Parkour UK, Performance Parkour and water-sports groups. To maximise the impact of the series we have identified key target groups and developed a short, medium and long-term impact strategy.
 
Broadly we have identified a) Policy makers involved with Lifestyle sport [LS] provision. Nationally this includes a wide range of Government policy-makers and officials, across a range of departments and executive non-departmental public bodies including Sport England, The Arts Council , Visit Britain. Also of relevance is The British Olympic Association. b) Those involved with the provision, regulation and teaching of LS across public and private sectors, locally and nationally. 

In our pathway to impact we have identified a wide range of groups and organisations working in and across sectors who will benefit from the discussions and findings. Some examples include: physical education providers, active lifestyles initiatives, including walking and cycling schemes, Sport and Recreation Alliance, Countryside Research Network, Forestry Commission. 

At the more local level we have identified, or are already working with a wide range of relevant organisations through to local Government. These include; Parkour UK., The RYA, Performance Parkour, Active Dorset County sports and physical activity partnership, Active Sussex, Active Devon, Hastings Borough Council, British Triathlon Federation,West Dorset District Council, Christchurch and East Dorset partnership, Ordnance survey, South Downs National park. 

Within the Business/commercial sectors - sport and leisure offer cities and regions opportunities for wealth creation, regeneration and economic prosperity. The seminars will provide opportunities for commercial operators working in the leisure and sport industries to acquire new knowledge relating to the contribution of sport/leisure practices to the community, the multiple forms of entrepreneurialism, innovation and enterprise and partnerships which are being played out, and how to work towards offering inclusive practices for all communities of end-users. Some examples include: the great big tree climbing company Rockleigh Park water sports, Bournemouth Surf School, Paul Harbour water sports, adventure sport holidays, surf steps, Parkour Generations.

Our dissemination activities include publications in a range of formats including; academic publications ( in international journals and edited collections), trade magazines to blogs and podcasts. We will hold a lifestyle sport festival involving live performances by practitioners in parkour, dance and street-surfing, taster sessions for the public, and talks based on the research findings. We have organising similar events for previous projects (eg. Parkour community awareness event; Anti-homophobia Football festivals ) and found them to be very effective in generating interest, and cross-community dialogue.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>26671</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seminar 1 - Mapping the Policy Context</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F1F91204-7902-49F0-BAAE-FABB4AECDD19</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In this first 2-day seminar we will explore the existing evidence base, and map key issues in the policy debates about the social value of Informal and Lifestyle Sports [LS].

How can LS be adopted for promoting more inclusive physical activity amongst target groups such as girls and minority ethnic groups?</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c032431d7087.12254469</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.informalandlifestylesports.org.uk/?page_id=75</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seminar 6 - Key Findings and Lifestyle Sports Festival</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>60F8159B-82EC-4254-B68D-B27F50BF259A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This final workshop is to draw together Key Findings and to develop future plans. Participants will be selected based on the key findings from Seminars 1-5.

The Lifestyle Sports Festival will disseminate findings and involve performances by practitioners and 'taster' sessions (e.g. in parkour, dance, street-surfing). It will be part of the annual TAKEPART Festival run by Brighton and HoveCity Council for ten years. This festival will constitute part of the ten year anniversary of the TAKPART event. This is aimed at engaging members of the public in physical activity and will have a significant focus on lifestyle and informal sports as a result of this funding.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c033d08caf67.24586080</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seminars 4 and 5 - Minority Participants in Informal Sporting Spaces</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A55FBE59-62AA-4616-A0C6-0D633F8225BF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In this seminar we will consider the experiences of these &amp;quot;less visible&amp;quot; participants and consumer groups, including girls and women, and older participants. We will examine: the political potential of this so-called 'female athletic revolution' (Comer, 2010), and how to promote greater equity and strategies for change amongst young and older women; the forms of exclusion and barriers to inclusion (in relation to sexuality/gender/ race/age/disability) that operate in these informal sporting spaces; the role of the media and action sport industries in promoting greater equity and/or reproducing sexist and neo-colonial discourses; the ability of lifestyle sport based NGOs to tackle gender issues and empower vulnerable and marginalised groups.
The second day of the seminar we will consider the complex factors contributing to make minority ethnic groups feel 'out of place' in white-dominated countryside spaces and how to develop more inclusive policy practices. We aim to understand identity, belonging and exclusion in LS contexts, and the capacity for LS to reinforce or challenge this racial status quo.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c0331ce486b2.99828038</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.informalandlifestylesports.org.uk/?page_id=90</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seminar 3 - Informal Sport in School and the PE Curriculum</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FAC1FDE6-3A52-4C6C-9702-81801689AE70</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The PE curriculum introduced into secondary schools in England in 2009 marked a shift in emphasis from activities (such as team games) towards core skills (such as balance and flight) encouraging some schools to adopt a greater range of activities. Some schools have incorporated non-traditional LS such as skateboarding, Ultimate Frisbee, street surfing, and parkour. Research about the impact of these initiatives, or about which pupils benefit, and why, remains anecdotal. Proponents argue activities like parkour provide managed risk-taking for children in urban environments but critics claim there are legitimate health and safety fears (Beaumont. &amp;amp; Whitlam 2010). We will examine the ways schools have expanded their provision of non-traditional LS sports (both in and out of curriculum time), and the perceived benefits. How do children develop physical literacy in these activities? Are benefits transferable to other contexts? (e.g. education, work, community). How have schools and policy makers established parameters of acceptable and safe practice? Why do these sports attract different children to those attracted to traditional competitive games? What is the role of dance in these debates?</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c032cf268fb1.27619673</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.informalandlifestylesports.org.uk/?page_id=88</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seminar 2 - Institutionalisation and Regulation</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>04199DB2-F951-4528-B786-BBEF1B47920B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The second ESRC seminar on exploring the social benefits of informal and lifestyle sport will focus on issues of institutionalisation, regulation and risk. Youth-focused informal physical activities have been associated with high risk and irresponsibility leading to attempts to regulate, contain and institutionalise these activities. This seminar will examine these issues in different informal and lifestyle sports contexts to develop understandings about how to effectively develop and promote informal and lifestyle sport opportunities whilst retaining the strong alternative ethos and values that characterise such physical activities.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c0328e00ccb3.26252626</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.informalandlifestylesports.org.uk/?page_id=77</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>20000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>Switzerland, Swiss Confederation</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>EUR</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>Austria</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>de_AT</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Advanced Olympic Research Grant Programme</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-07-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>International Olympic committee</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>03CC7A13-AD58-4009-88DD-5918F6F6DFF5</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c017d5ea3a27.35446748</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-07-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E3827FC8-4418-487A-BF03-8F99A13EDA0E</gtr:id><gtr:title>International Journal of Sport Policy and Politics Special Issue: Exploring the social benefit of informal and lifestyle sport</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8ce59f83eba82c069885453eafef505e"><gtr:id>8ce59f83eba82c069885453eafef505e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wheaton B</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>58c0127a92a780.32166960</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>84F9E2CA-BB34-444D-8244-44D08A4622C7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Exploring the Social Benefit of Informal and Lifestyle Sports</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Sport Science and Physical Education</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8ce59f83eba82c069885453eafef505e"><gtr:id>8ce59f83eba82c069885453eafef505e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wheaton B</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c013e4c21632.92831525</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B1AD0E9B-E89C-4939-836F-749E229AEE5D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Routledge Handbook of Youth Sport</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8ce59f83eba82c069885453eafef505e"><gtr:id>8ce59f83eba82c069885453eafef505e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wheaton B</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c0174005a406.42457322</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/M002705/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9B2F1F6E-2F07-4F8E-A221-DFB5E1C9FB9E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Edu Sociocloy/Sociology of Edu</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>33A50DE3-0023-4F8B-810C-F0B929F9218F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Womens and Gender Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
