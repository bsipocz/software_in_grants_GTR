The latest cosmological models believe that structure in the Universe has grown from extremely small overdensities in the dark matter distribution in the Early Universe. Due to gravitational attraction, these overdensities have drawn in more and more surrounding matter over time to form increasingly larger objects: first stars, then galaxies, and eventually groups and clusters of galaxies. If we observe a cluster very far away, the light has travelled a long time to reach us, and therefore we are seeing the cluster as it was when it was very young. Obviously the younger a cluster is, the smaller it is as it hasn't had the time yet to grow to the size of clusters in the present day. By studying the number of nearby clusters and their masses as well as those at much greater distances, we can learn about the rate of growth of large-scale structure in the Universe throughout time. This tells us about a number of vital aspects of cosmology, such as the nature and amount of dark energy, the amount of dark matter, and any deviation from Einstein's theory of gravity. Clusters are not only very valuable objects of study for Cosmology, but also for Astrophysics. Because they exhibit such a large gravitational force, the matter within the cluster can not easily escape. Therefore a large amount of very hot gas resides in the clusters, with which the galaxies and stars interact. Cooling gas flows into the galaxies, enabling more star-formation. On the other hand, when many massive stars explode as supernovae, gas can be expelled out of the galaxy. Another type of outflow from galaxies is by jets from Active Galactic Nuclei, driven by a supermassive black hole - which can be up to a billion times more massive than the Sun - in the centre of a galaxy. These outflows can heat up the gas in the space between the galaxies again, which causes star-formation to cease. These processes govern galaxy formation and evolution, and are best observed in galaxy clusters. Detecting clusters at high distances is very important if we want to study the evolution of the clusters themselves and the galaxies within. This is however no easy task: the galaxies are often too faint to see in the optical light because the bulk of their radiation is redshifted into the infrared wavelength regime. Very sensitive wide-field infrared cameras have therefore recently been built to image a huge portion of the sky. My research involves the implementation of innovative techniques to detect clusters up to great distances using these infrared surveys. I will carry out three main projects during my PPARC fellowship: (i) I will use a state-of-the-art technique that I have recently invented to compile the largest catalogue to date of clusters at large distances. This will allow me to constrain the parameters that define the cosmological model. (ii) I will use datasets in all wavelengths (from X-ray to radio) to uncover the processes with which galaxies interact with the cluster gas and determine how this has evolved throughout time. We will also obtain a better understanding of the relationships between the quantities we can observe - such as galaxy luminosities in optical light and the luminosity of the cluster gas in X-ray - and the quantities we can model, such as the number of clusters in the Universe and their masses. (iii) I will study star-formation throughout time by targeting a specific type of object: Lyman-alpha emitters. These are galaxies that comprise many young stars that heat the hydrogen gas within the galaxy itself enough to emit strongly. To search for these galaxies I will use one of the latest types of instrument: an Integral Field Unit. With this instrument we can obtain a spectrum of each point in the sky we are looking at simultaneously, which makes it ideal to detect line-emitting galaxies.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>251250</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">PP/E005179/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>615BB43C-305A-47B9-B728-7A9BB0BBE1A4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Astronomy - observation</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>A50650F5-D901-49C3-AA30-F625AC696676</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Particle Astrophysics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C2898760-D7E5-4B25-A236-E7869CD74F88</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Particle physics - experiment</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>200B9B9B-68EC-4D70-B889-6BD5F4538080</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Beyond the Standard Model</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>760D5B7E-1353-4BD7-8172-CFFC4A254A5C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cosmology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>C5529360-827A-4C08-881B-88F10B12ADDD</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Data Handling &amp; Storage</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4EE2392F-9964-4A0B-8C0A-1672FD744F8B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>70</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Extra-Galactic Astron.&amp;Cosmol.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EC478D98-EB7D-4905-B536-D9D61AFD07E4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Galactic &amp; Interstellar Astron</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
