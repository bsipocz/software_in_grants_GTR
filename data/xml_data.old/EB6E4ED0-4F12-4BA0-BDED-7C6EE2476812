Consumption historians have begun to study the purchase and use of material goods in relation to both the economic concept of demand and to standards of living. Recent books have also studied goods in relation to how individuals created self-identities and how they projected social identities of power and status. All of these studies have focused on the middling sort or the very wealthy because they could own and consume more and therefore have left more records. However the poor always constituted at least 50-60% of the population through the early modern period, and for this reason alone warrant study even if sources are more difficult to locate. Surprisingly, no general study exists looking at labourers' earnings and consumption patterns throughout England, and agricultural labourers have hardly been considered at all even though over 80% of the population lived in the countryside and in small villages. \nThe aim of this project is to uncover the diet, work patterns and standard of living of the rural poor between 1550 and the beginnings of industrialisation in the late eighteenth century. Institutional and military diets can be examined in combination with farm accounts and pamphlets on diet and health to see what poor and labouring families were eating. Once this is done, various eighteenth century budget estimates for poor families and servants can be combined with this information and earlier price series to estimate consumption over time. There is also more information on family earnings which can be used in the same way to estimate women and children's contribution to family earnings, especially from spinning and agricultural work such as weeding. Household goods can be examined by using probate inventories, as little attention has been paid to what the poor might have actually owned. \nSince food accounted for over 50% of labouring families expenditure, the investigation of diet will form a central part of the book. It is often assumed that the diet of the poor consisted of little more than bread, pottage and cheese. But both beer and meat seem to have constituted a much larger portion of some diets than is generally assumed. Many people ate a pound of meat a day and some more, but even the working poor ate about five to six ounces a day, which is more than is normal today. Also, the amount of beer consumed was as prodigious as it was strong. Their diet also included vegetables grown in their small gardens and made into stews with their meat, and a good deal of local fruit made into puddings.\nIt is also important to realise how different the world the early modern poor lived in was from an industrial environment dominated by machines. Before the widespread harnessing of machine energy based on carbon fuel, almost all labour had to be done by men and animals. This was hard work and required a great deal of food energy to accomplish. Bread and beer were the petrol of this world. My work shows that working labourers had to consume upwards of 4000 calories a day (the modern norm for a middle class man would be about 2,900) in order to work 10 hours a day six days a week for most of the year. The types of food eaten were based on a very complex system of knowledge about what was healthy, which had little to do with what we now know through science to be nutritious. Beer and meat especially were thought to be good for labour as the first promoted sweat and the latter being muscle was thought to promote strength. Most of us now do much less physical work, and know much more about our bodies, but the saying we are what we eat is as true now as it was then.\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-07-21</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-04-22</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>25306</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/F015208/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DCE73056-5E3D-4976-B573-234E5FF4D633</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic &amp; Social History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
