The practice of reading, however, is not a uniform or unchanging one: it has a history, like any other human activity. To study that history we need evidence not only of what people in the past read, but how and in what circumstances they read, and what impact their reading had on them. The Reading Experience Database (RED) was established at The Open University as an open access digital resource offering users a searchable body of evidence of reading by British subjects, at home and abroad, from 1450 up to 1945 (see http://www.open.ac.uk/Arts/reading/). RED was funded by the AHRC for three years, 2006-2009, and currently holds about 30,000 separate records of reading experience. It attracts over 3,000 visits each month, and the rate of usage is rising at 50% per year. RED has been designed as a resource not only for historians of the book and of reading, but for social historians, local and family historians, literary scholars, biographers, book collectors, librarians, and anyone interested in the readership and reception of particular authors or books, and in the activities of specific readers or groups of readers.\n\nFor the purposes of RED, a 'reading experience' is defined as a recorded engagement with a written or printed text beyond the mere fact of possession. Under 'written or printed text' we include books, newspapers, journals, advertisements, playbills, scripts, pamphlets, almanacs, commonplace books, and ephemera. The evidence presented in RED is drawn from autobiographies, diaries, marginalia and letters, etc., and from databases such as the Old Bailey Sessions Papers and Mass Observation Online. As well as details of work(s) being read, RED records data about readers: their name, age, gender, occupation, social class, religion, and place where the reading took place. This richly textured data offers both a micro and a macro perspective, enabling us to get closer to the cognitive and affective elements of individual reading experiences, as well as illuminating the broader changes in historical circumstances and material conditions within which reading took place.\n\nReading, however, is not confined within national boundaries. It is a transnational phenomenon and researchers need to be able to collect and analyse evidence from different countries. This new research project is designed to facilitate the establishment of RED projects in Australia, Canada, the Netherlands and New Zealand, and to ensure that these national REDs are compatible with the UK RED and with each other. The current UK RED software will be made freely available to partners in these countries, and a systematic, easy-to-use 'umbrella search' function will be developed which will enable a user of one RED to search across all the others. We will create a new web portal interface designed to facilitate ease of use, making use of web 2.0, and including teaching and research tools (offered as web tutorials). We will create additional capacity in the RED datasets to enable future inclusion of oral testimony of readers born before 1950, and visual evidence, such as photographs of reading. These developments will enhance the attractiveness of REDs to a wide variety of users, and will facilitate further international collaboration in the history of reading.\n\nIn summary, the current project is designed to: (a) broaden the use of and contribution to RED beyond the British Isles, making it a centre for international collaboration in the history of reading; (b) create an 'umbrella search' function to allow a user of one RED to search all the others as well; (c) increase understanding of the history of reading by ensuring that REDs include oral and visual data to supplement textual sources; and (d) engage with the wider public interest in the history of reading outside academia.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Maximising impact\nOver the three years of AHRC funding, the previous RED team took part in a range of knowledge transfer activities with schools and libraries. Furthermore, over 60 volunteers, mostly from outside the university sector, have entered thousands of items of data into RED. These activities confirm the potential of RED as a valuable public resource and as a focus for community-led digitisation activity. To maximise the impact of the new project, in research, teaching, wider participation and knowledge transfer, we will:\n\n1. Create a new, more user-friendly web portal front end, offering a web-tutorial on using RED; a student skills' diagnostic for assessing use; web 2.0 tools, such as an interactive discussion forum; and an RSS feed. \n\n2. Facilitate wider public educational partnerships, by making data sharing readily available. Using an Entity Authority Tool Set to tag authority data will allow us to share data within the databases and externally with other established public access digital resources. Widespread data sharing with outreach projects in the digital humanities (such as Project Australia, Yourarchives.gov.uk, Your History, Your Heritage-Collections Canada) will maximise public participation. Wherever possible, we will hot-link data with external digital sources (e-repositories, digitisation projects, biographical sources, etc.), thereby increasing access to and engagement with our data.\n\n3. Involve non-academic partners, such as public bodies, government institutions, libraries, archives, local history societies and continuing education bodies, in knowledge transfer activities. Potential partners would include English Heritage, the Reading Agency, the Literacy Trust, The School Library Association, and CILIP. \n\n4. Hold a series of workshops targeted at specific practitioner communities, such as teachers, librarians, local studies archivists, museum curators. These would show, for example, how RED might be used by teachers in the classroom, or how family historians could become involved in the project, by entering material about the reading habits of family members in the past. RED's accessibility as an open learning resource will foster self-education within the wider community.\n\n5. Encourage further listing of the enhanced RED resource with public and local libraries, and gather feedback from these during the course of development. The existing UK RED is listed on the National Institute of Adult Continuing Education's Quick Reads site, The Reader Online magazine site, as well as on international sites such as Korea's National Library for Children and Young Adults site, and Portugal's National Directorate for Books and Libraries site. This international Web presence would increase exponentially with the establishment of a series of searchable national REDs.\n\nAssessing Impact\nRED has achieved a significant Web presence. An Internet search using the major search engines yielded the following results: Google, nearly 46,000 hits; Yahoo and AltaVista, nearly 34,000 hits(searched 2 November 2009). RED attracts well over 3,000 visitors a month (data from Open University Academic and Administrative Computing Services). For the new project we will use a standardised diagnostic tool (such as Google Analytics) across all the databases to provide more detailed quantitative data about access to and use of the databases. We will implement a citation data policy (using JISC's TIDSR as a guideline) to provide qualitative and quantitative data about citations. We will also introduce feedback questionnaires (online/e-mail and hard copy) to provide additional qualitative data about the impact of the project. Usage data will be monitored through the course of the project and included in ongoing development and outreach plans. These impact assessment tools will provide a significant legacy after the funding per</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-04-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100778</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Please note: as this grant (AH/H037217/1) is a follow-on funding from the primary AHRC grant for the Reading Experience Database (119236/1), the non-academic impacts have been cumulative and draw from both grants successively.

Major non-academic beneficiaries in terms of impact have been: librarians and archivists; lifelong learners; members of the public interested in reading; cultural organisations.

As of 1/02/2012, RED has been mentioned or listed in some 4,210 instances in the blogosphere, largely independently and in personal blogs by users interested in the history of reading (some examples given below). RED's online contribution system has itself become the subject of research in designing public facing data collection interfaces for crowdsourcing projects (McKinley), while archivists and librarians have increasingly used it as a training and outreach tool to engage members of the public in arts and humanities research (Ruddock). 
RED has been listed as one of the top 100 websites in the world by Curators at the British Library ('Capturing the Digital Universe') where it is listed alongside resources such as the BBC, EBay, Amazon, Facebook, Mumsnet and Twitter and categorised as 'essential reading for future generations researching our life and times in 2013'. RED has been featured in the mainstream press in a number of countries specifically as a project that engages the interests of the wider public (McGowan, Ottawa Citizen, 26/07/2009; Howard, Chronicle of Higher Education, 17/12/2012; Moran, The Guardian, 22/03/2011).

RED is open access and externally searchable - all collated data has been indexed by Google and can be retrieved by members of the public across the world through simple searching. The widespread reach of the interest in RED can be demonstrated through embedded Google Analytics data: 11,728 unique visitors and 3,092 repeat visitors over 12 months (1/05/2010-30/04/2011) during the most recent AHRC funded period came from 135 different countries. Average visitor time spent on the site increased from 2.5 minutes to 4 minutes during this period. These figures have since continued to increase. In March 2013, the database attracted 1,554 unique visitors from more than 100 countries with 47% of visitors to the database from outside the UK (unique monthly visitors have been consistently over the 1,500 mark). The RED dataset has been used for JISC funded projects on linked data (LUCERO), Digital humanities teaching and research projects, and by IBM for data visualisation (semantic analysis). 

The RED model of research harnessed to public voluntary contribution has inspired partner projects in Australia, Canada, the Netherlands and New Zealand engaging specifically with the museum, heritage, public library and education sectors. AusRED (Griffith University, Brisbane, Australia. PI: Prof P. Buckridge) (http://www.griffith.edu.au/humanities-languages/centre-cultural-research/research/australian-reading-experience-database/) is working with the national digital humanities hub for literature, AustLIT; Can-RED-LEC (Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada, PI: Prof.B.MacDonald (http://can-red-lec.library.dal.ca/) is working with Canada's National Museum for Immigration and the National Maritime Museum, both in Halifax.; NZ-RED (Victoria University Wellington.

In addition, RED's public contribution and dissemination model has been used as a proof of concept and best practice for the Open University Music Department and Royal College of Music AHRC funded project, the Listening Experience Database (&amp;pound;750,000 2013-2018) which is using the online data contribution and volunteer management methods pioneered by RED.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>498F629B-16AA-4B99-849C-0CC69061CF7C</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56dff277987d61.67614841</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The DEDEFI funded project has allowed us to:

(1) preserve the integrity of the dataset, and make it available as an open access resource to international partners;

(3) develop new research questions about international and transnational histories of reading;

(4) work towards a common ontology for future projects;

(5) complete work on data clean-up, migration to a multi-table structure, and far greater interlinking of data;

(6) add nearly 3,000 additional data entries during this period, largely as a result of the work of team members and dedicated volunteers;

(7) work towards future funding opportunities for collaborative, international work on the history of reading practices;

(8) demonstrate through Google analytics and other data, the increased international use of the database.



During this period and beyond, we maintained a commitment to the housing and maintenance of the existing database on OU servers, quality assurance and open access to data was made in the AHRC-DEDEFI funded round. No formal commitments for additional development beyond the funded period were made to AHRC in the last funded round (AHRC-DEDEFI, completed 3/2011) however, the project team has continued to make sure the resource is kept updated in line with Institutional requirements.



Further work on the interface, partial automation of data retrieval/editing, and work with new partners, such as the recently established Listening Experience Database (Open University/Royal College of Music) is ongoing.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>RED has considerable appeal for non-specialist users - our volunteer base continues to grow, and our current and future outreach plans are based around engaging non-academic users with the material we have gathered.

An online, open-access project with over 30,000 entries, it is revolutionising public understanding of the history of reading. RED is democratising scholarship about the history of reading by encouraging ordinary members of the public from any location to contribute and use information about readers through history. 120+ volunteers from outside academia have already contributed some 6,000 entries. RED attracts over 1500 users per month from over 135 countries and has inspired partner projects in Australia, Canada, the Netherlands and New Zealand</gtr:description><gtr:id>ECA17E19-D6A9-4D90-910A-8CBCB8BAA5D3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Reading Experience Database demonstrates that (a) reading can be provided with a history that can be tracked both qualitatively and quantitatively through evidenced accounts of reading experiences between 1450 and 1945, and that (b) a democratic public engagement and data gathering model (online open contribution from volunteers) offers the best way of systematically collating and disseminating this information. Derived from scattered accounts of reading from a wide variety of sources, the fully searchable Database has subsequently provided the material and tools for constructing such a history within Britain and beyond. This open contribution project is generating data to answer existing and new research questions, which might be summarised as: who was reading, where they were reading, what they were reading, and in what circumstances or company. RED is committed to democratising the generation and transmission of knowledge, and all contributions and contributors from all locations and backgrounds are given equal value - the project has no literary or elitist bias. 
The research project was initiated by Prof Simon Eliot and Prof W.R. Owens in 1995 (http://www.open.ac.uk/Arts/RED/redback.htm). The award of an AHRB fellowship allowed the creation of (a) a customised hard copy data collection form (b) the appointment of an RA Dr Stephen Colclough (Reading) for 5 years to create a location register and gather a substantial body of primary data, and (c) the creation of a closed, internally housed database to store data. The next step was to digitise data, disseminate findings, and engage with new and existing research questions in the history of reading in a 3 year research project, 'The Reading Experience Database, 1800-1945' (AHRC, 2006-2009) led by Owens (PI, OU) with Eliot (Co-I, IES London) and Dr Mary Hammond (Co-I and project supervisor, OU), and two postdoctoral RAs, Crone (OU) and Halsey (IES). This constructed and populated an online, open access database, gathered additional data, and hosted a 3 day international conference. With the significant contribution of non-academic volunteers, the data entry target of 25,000 entries over 3 years was exceeded. A 3 day international conference, 'Evidence of Reading: Reading the Evidence' (21-23 July 2008) was attended by over 160 delegates from than 20 countries (http://ies.sas.ac.uk/events/conferences/2008/RED/index.htm). Research outputs included a number of landmark publications in the field (outputs 1-6 below). This lead to another 12 month AHRC project 'Developing an International Digital Network in the History of Reading: collaboration between the UK Reading Experience Database and invited partners' (AHRC, 2010-2011) led by Owens (PI) with Towheed (Co-I) and Crone (Co-I) established formal research and development collaborations with 4 international partner RED projects. The UK software was made available to partners in these countries, and a systematic, easy-to-use 'umbrella search' function developed to allow future users of one RED to search across all the others. The attractiveness of RED to international, non-academic user-groups both was enhanced in a number of ways: a new web interface; the provision of online teaching material (11 short essays, 3 online tutorials); production of new promotional material; and new engagement with social media. 

Volunteer participation as evidence of public engagement and impact - significance
Over 120 volunteers have contributed a fifth of all entries (c.6000 items) in the database, making RED the largest single repository of publicly sourced, unsolicited and voluntarily contributed information about readers and reading in the world. Volunteers can follow their own personal interests (such as the reading habits of their favourite writer), or enter information from the reading diaries of an ancestor in their own family papers. They receive guidance and training from RED project members, and develop considerable expertise in handling and interpreting documentary sources. The open nature of the online contribution entry system means that RED can support unsolicited volunteers based anywhere in the world. This form of crowdsourcing generates supportive and symbiotic contact between members of the public and publicly funded academic research. Significantly, the contribution of volunteers have helped to generate further research questions for the project team, including PhD projects, and a number of new peer-reviewed scholarly publications (see audio-visual material below and references to research above). The diversity of volunteers encourages a wider scope for collected data and provides a further quality assurance for the project, while providing volunteers with public recognition of their contribution to scholarship. This two way model for sourcing and disseminating data from members of the public has attracted considerable interest.
Media attention as evidence of impact and corroboration- reach
As of 1/02/2012, RED has been mentioned or listed in some 4,210 instances in the blogosphere, largely independently and in personal blogs by users interested in the history of reading (some examples given below).
