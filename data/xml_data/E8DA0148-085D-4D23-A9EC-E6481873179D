Multiple Scales</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Fellowship</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>NE/L011611/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Biodiversity, the huge variety of life on earth, is declining with species going extinct at a frightening rate. Consequently, there is a pressing need to better understand biodiversity and how it reacts to the way humans are changing the natural world. The main focus of this project is on fragmentation: the separation of different areas of habitat. When human activities cause fragmentation, for example by separating chunks of rainforest between farms or other altered landscapes, this can have devastating effects on biodiversity. Paradoxically, however, geographic processes, such as the formation of islands and mountain ranges, leave isolated fragments of habitat, but are thought to increase biodiversity by fostering the creation of new species. Reconnecting such naturally isolated landscapes can also be damaging for biodiversity by introducing alien species that compete with the native species. This project will develop a unified set of tools to study both human induced and geographic forms of fragmentation and reconnection.

I will use &amp;quot;neutral models&amp;quot; as a foundation for simulations of biodiversity. Neutral models typically assume a basic set of rules about how organisms interact, but I will develop ways to make them more realistic. For example, by allowing for different types of species to exist in different habitats and allowing some species to evolve slight competitive advantages. Methods I have developed enable these models to be simulated efficiently, even on complex landscapes with many fragments of different shapes and sizes. 

I am especially interested in patterns of biodiversity and evolutionary history on islands and I plan to use my models to study evolution on island systems and its response to geological changes. I will then progress to predict the effects of human impacts on islands such as those of global transport networks that cause the artificial movement of species to isolated places. This work is important because being able to understand biodiversity and how it responds to change is the first step towards minimising our impacts on the environment we rely on.

The effects of recent fragmentation events are not all necessarily seen immediately. Environmental changes such as fragmentation leave us with an &amp;quot;extinction debt&amp;quot;, a debt of species extinctions that needs to be paid at some point in the future. One aim of the models constructed in this project is to improve methods of predicting extinction debt. I will test these models with data showing the effects of fragmenting a tropical forest by the creation of oil palm plantations. 

In addition to my central research work, I will continue to improve my public outreach project at www.onezoom.org, a novel and popular website where members of the public can explore the tree of life, and see how different species are related through evolution. Ten months after release it has already been frequently used for teaching, as a tool by scientists, and in displays at public venues. OneZoom can place unlimited amounts of information onto one virtual page that is explored intuitively by zooming. I hope to expand and enhance OneZoom to enable more people to discover the beauty of biodiversity and the elegance of evolution.

I find the work in this proposal exciting because it addresses import issues for society. My work will focus on understanding biodiversity and how it responds to change; this is the first step towards making informed decisions about conservation to minimise our impacts on the natural world. Furthermore, my project contains significant technical challenges, which will make the best use of my existing skills in biology, maths and computing. I believe that computer simulations such as the ones I propose in this project will have an increasingly important role in future research into ecology and conservation; I am excited to have the chance to play a role in that future.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The impact and benefits to society of this research will be realised by reaching out to a range of beneficiaries. 

1.) Scientists 
The more theoretical advances of my work will benefit other researchers including project partners. The work of these other scientists will in turn be of benefit to a range of &amp;quot;second order beneficiaries&amp;quot;. I will make new simulation software available to the wider scientific community and introduce novel and potentially far-reaching concepts such as the nearly neutral theory for ecology.

2) Policy Makers
There are often a number of alternative land use development scenarios available to policy makers and any knowledge provided by scientists on issues such as fragmentation is of value enabling informed decisions to be made. The SAFE project team has excellent links to policy makers in Malaysian Borneo who will benefit from the output of project SAFE to which my work will contribute. More generally, my work on the effects of human-induced habitat fragmentation and reconnection will be of benefit to policy makers, but would need to be properly interpreted and compared against alternative models by conservation biologists. These conservation biologists would be the most suitable people to communicate their findings to policy makers.

3) Members of the public
It is important that the public is educated on subjects such as evolution, fragmentation and conservation science. Tropical rainforests and islands represent ecosystems that easy capture the public imagination. The public will benefit from direct communication via press releases, public presentations of the scientific advancements of this project and visits to science fairs. This will both enhance their knowledge of recent scientific advances and provide entertainment. 

My project will further develop the OneZoom website to significantly enhance the user experience and make a greater amount of content accessible to a broader audience. This will enable more people to wonder at the diversity of life on earth and understand the fundamental process of evolution that created it and the human activity that is now threatens it.

4.) Educators 
Many educators at schools and universities across the world have written saying how useful they find OneZoom for teaching evolution. I also frequently receive requests for extra functionality and improvements that would significantly enhance its impact as a learning tool. As part of this proposal I will incorporate the most promising of such improvements and increase awareness of the work and its capabilities in collaboration with the National Science Learning Centre.

5.) Musuems and Zoos
OneZoom is a perfect interactive learning tool ripe for deployment in museums, zoos, botanical gardens and other venues. I will make the software customisable to include directions to animals and plants on display and thus provides an evolution centred index for the diversity on display in public education venues. I will collaborate with the Zoological Society of London, which will use my software to communicate phylogenetic based conservation prioritisation to the public and possible supporters of their conservation programs.
 
6.) Industry
The SAFE project has links with industry and will advise on best practice minimising environmental impacts. This is a further example of a &amp;quot;second order beneficiary&amp;quot;. In addition, OneZoom has potential as a visualisation engine for other forms of big data such as industrial process plant monitoring.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>490021</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A video summary of my research</gtr:description><gtr:id>5997D7AE-0FF3-4790-8D3B-A9E7B8D5E47F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Enhanced profile of research work</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b57ae24d7596.35349335</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>GCEE Research Focus - Dr. James Rosindell</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwKPrniGCnU</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The concept of extinction debt explained with a bottle of water and a screwdriver.</gtr:description><gtr:id>72B5521C-6C41-4B00-BB96-DB1151FB9451</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None yet</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b57cd54c8819.19449910</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Extinction debt in 60 seconds</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0obXPy9G8&amp;feature=youtu.be</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2017</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Groningen</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Netherlands, Kingdom of the</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with Rampal Etienne</gtr:description><gtr:id>3DFA11B4-57E7-4AAF-9CB9-35C8F9DC594C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>10 publications - see publications list</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5458e4dc0aafc5.84893141-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Ideas, time, expertise - in general we have both contributed similarly to the collaboration, but come from different perspectives.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Ideas, software, time</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2006-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with Stephen Hubbell</gtr:description><gtr:id>72876775-BF42-4150-BC17-7CAED54D7F5E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Three publication have so far come from this collaboration, two in TREE and one in Ecology Letters.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5459113406ebf8.08825335-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Expertise in the specific area of study that is of interest.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Ideas, software, working on joint projects and papers</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2010-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Imperial College London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp;

The impact of this was that over 60,000 visitors had the opportunity to learn from the OneZoom display and even benefit from it as a cultural or artistic work as well as a scientific one. Three other venues make use of more primitive versions of the software released under an open source license. The Biodiversity Institute at the University of Wyoming have two permanent OneZoom kiosks and the Natural History Museum in Sydney has a further instance of OneZoom. As of 2016 the software has been made freely available open source and commercial licensing has ceased. Ongoing development has been taken over by a not for profit organisation.</gtr:impact><gtr:licensed>Yes</gtr:licensed><gtr:outcomeId>5456a352996fc5.16000804</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:protection>Copyrighted (e.g. software)</gtr:protection><gtr:title>OneZoom Tree of Life Explorer Interactive Kiosk Software Licensing</gtr:title><gtr:yearProtectionGranted>2013</gtr:yearProtectionGranted></gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput><gtr:description>Big data visualisation tools for human genealogy.</gtr:description><gtr:grantRef>NE/L011611/1</gtr:grantRef><gtr:id>C32632CC-9E04-4342-9641-37075FB6BF82</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Formal set up of a spinout company.</gtr:impact><gtr:licensed>Yes</gtr:licensed><gtr:outcomeId>58b577b3856024.92157520</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:protection>Copyrighted (e.g. software)</gtr:protection><gtr:title>ZoomPast genealogy visualisation software</gtr:title><gtr:yearProtectionGranted>2016</gtr:yearProtectionGranted></gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput></gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The grant is still active but so far a key finding has been the production of model integrating ecology and evolution.

To advance the education of the public in the subjects of evolution, biodiversity and conservation of the variety of life on earth.

In pursuit of this objective, the CIO's planned activities will focus on building and maintaining a scientifically accurate, educational, and visually appealing record of the tree of life that is easily accessible to the public.

The CIO has three trustees and expects to fundraise via crowdfunding in order to hire a developer, pay for basic running costs and support three summer placements.</gtr:description><gtr:id>E524F182-9209-49F1-813D-ED1A4472FCBD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This is a not for profit organisation (a registered CIO in the UK) the website http://www.onezoom.org/impact.htm tells about impacts of the work that led to the formation of the charity.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d41dc3b11cc2.60348604</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:url>http://www.onezoom.org</gtr:url><gtr:yearCompanyFormed>2015</gtr:yearCompanyFormed></gtr:spinOutOutput></gtr:spinOutOutputs></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>FB2D363C-852C-4ED7-83C6-FA1E444901D3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Unifying ecology and macroevolution with individual-based theory.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Ecology letters</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d0ff7fbccea194601ebea62c5893e739"><gtr:id>d0ff7fbccea194601ebea62c5893e739</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rosindell J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1461-023X</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5675e175ab7a6</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5FB5025F-6A7B-4986-ADA4-25A35FDAC6FA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Quantifying the effects of the break up of Pangaea on global terrestrial diversification with neutral theory.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.
