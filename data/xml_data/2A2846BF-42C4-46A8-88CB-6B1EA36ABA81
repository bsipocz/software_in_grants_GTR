Concentrating on the recently-identified 'Ghazalian' current, which took its cue from al-Ghazali's (d. 1111) criticism of the philosophical tradition in his 'Incoherence of the Philosophers', it investigates (i) the reception of the philosophical system of Avicenna (d. 1037), the most important medieval Arabic philosopher, and (ii) its interaction with Ash'ari theology in the east of the Muslim world during the twelfth century. This period marks the transition from the 'classical' phase of Arabic philosophy and Islamic theology to the 'post-classical' phase characterised by the rise and dominance of a tradition of philosophical theology, which continued to thrive until the early modern period.\n\nThe main outcome of the project will be a monograph that concentrates on the most important text representing this Ghazalian current. Written by Sharaf al-Din al-Mas'udi (d. ca. 1190), a key but hitherto-unstudied figure, the 'Doubts on the Pointers' is the first in a long series of commentaries on Avicenna's widely-read philosophical work the 'Pointers'. Al-Mas'udi's book consists of critical commentaries on selected sections from the physical and metaphysical parts of the 'Pointers', and exhibits the influence of earlier critics of Avicenna, particularly al-Ghazali and the philosopher Abu l-Barakat al-Baghdadi (d. 1165). Rejecting several major Avicennan doctrines and arguments (especially concerning psychology and perception, hylomorphism and the nature of the Necessary Existent) the author proposes alternative, philosophically interesting theories, which ultimately serve to harmonise Avicennan philosophy with, and to integrate it in, the Ash'ari theological system.\n\nAl-Mas'udi and his commentary were, in turn, deeply influential on his younger contemporary Fakhr al-Din al-Razi (d. 1210), with whom he associated and debated on several occasions. Al-Razi, nonetheless, became intensely critical of the Ghazalian current and went on to develop his own sophisticated and systematic synthesis, which to a great extent set the main parameters for the later philosophico-theological tradition. The historical interest of al-Mas'udi's text, therefore, stems from the fact that it constitutes a key link that reveals a gradual development between the philosophical and theological activities taking place in the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries and those we then encounter in the late twelfth century and beyond.\n\nThe planned monograph will comprise a critical edition of al-Mas'udi's book and an interpretive study of the text. The interpretive study will contextualise the work, assess its historical significance, and offer an in-depth historico-analytical commentary on its philosophical contents.\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>\nBasic and robust textual, historical and philosophical research activities, such as the project proposed, make an important contribution to the UK's academic and cultural capital, and are of the essence for the health and sustainability of the academic field of Islamic studies, designated by the Government as a strategically important subject in the higher education context. The historical study of Islamic thought promotes the understanding of Islam and Islamic culture and informs other areas and approaches within Islamic studies broadly conceived.\n\nAs the proposed project explores an important phase in the intellectual history of Islam, it will highlight the role that reasoned, sophisticated and tolerant dialogue and debate played in the often pluralistic settings of medieval Islamic culture. The provision and support of scholarly expertise and activity in this area undoubtedly fosters interest in, and awareness of, such themes and intellectual trends mainly through teaching and postgraduate supervision. It will, furthermore, contribute to the promotion of sound, critical and dispassionate scholarly approaches, free from bias, confessional or otherwise, on the highly charged subject of Islam in mainstream higher education institutions.\n\nSupport for the proposed project will enrich the research environment and culture in the field of medieval Arabic thought in London, which is becoming, internationally, one of the most vibrant centres of scholarly expertise and activity in this field. There are now definite plans to apply for major project funding in the near future, including from the European Research Council, and to introduce a master's programme in medieval Arabic thought at SOAS. High quality research activity in this area also attracts substantial numbers of capable oversees postgraduate students.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-12-23</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-24</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>21663</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>A New Reading of al-Razi's Commentary on Avicenna's Pointers</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>49597A88-67AF-4E5F-B717-D09BD20BDD95</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The paper was presented at a major national conference, and was attended by both academics and students.

Focusing on an influential but previously unstudied and unpublished work by the philosopher Sharaf al-Din al-Mas'udi, it shows how this period witnessed increasing interaction between the philosophical and theological traditions, which had previously developed largely independently of each other. Al-Mas'udi's critical engagement with the philosophy of Avicenna, which had its roots in Aristotle, was instrumental to the gradual 'opening up' of Sunni theology to philosophy and science and the eventual emergence of a tradition of philosophical theology, which continued to influence, often dominate, mainstream Islamic thought into the early modern period.</gtr:description><gtr:id>768931CF-5467-4AD0-A10B-218367283D33</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56af5ce6587356.14810432</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors/></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>29834BE4-12FC-4841-A0C5-7D7946AE9D1A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Avicenna's Corporeal Form and Proof of Prime Matter in Twelfth-Century Critical Philosophy: Abu l-Barakat, al-Mas?udi and al-Razi</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Oriens</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/98017faf8494c1986f8e4f56a3e66d50"><gtr:id>98017faf8494c1986f8e4f56a3e66d50</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Shihadeh A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545b511ac502d5.34857745</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7B4B1D51-9959-4EF4-BE94-415EEB93C2D8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Fakhr al-Din al-Razi's Response to Sharaf al-Din al-Mas?udi's Critical Commentary on Avicenna's</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Muslim World</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/98017faf8494c1986f8e4f56a3e66d50"><gtr:id>98017faf8494c1986f8e4f56a3e66d50</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Shihadeh A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545b50753e9e99.82563603</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>925FD3DD-476D-45BE-AD33-6758684DB684</gtr:id><gtr:title>Oxford Handbook of Islamic Philosophy</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6423ee9db4f303143c5cd09f541400d6"><gtr:id>6423ee9db4f303143c5cd09f541400d6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Shihadeh A.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780199917389</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>545b526ca54174.07711621</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/J000140/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>946C0541-464B-43A5-9EE3-65C23360E959</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Philosophy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FE33AE51-7085-4BCA-8B2F-66C86B855F25</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Theology, divinity &amp; religion</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>963920AE-7577-4234-BB09-8B2D1C1FB695</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History Of Philosophy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>568F0BBC-BF8B-412D-B94B-C13277B157B6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Islam</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
