Tourism supports one in every 12 jobs in South Africa. It has been recognised that diversification is required in the tourist industry. The rich and varied culture of the Southern African region has been identified as a social resource that is both sustainable and brings a different experience to the tourists visiting the Region. Researchers, commentators and Government offices from Botswana, Zimbabwe and South Africa have all expressed similar aspirations for the development of cultural and heritage tourism. 

However, many countries in Southern Africa are still supported by overseas economic aid to offset need in the poorest communities. Within these poorest of communities, those living with a physical or cognitive impairment are often the most vulnerable. In collaboration with the Southern Africa Federation of the Disabled (SAFOD) the proposed network will lay the foundations of a bridge between communities and people living with disability within those communities; and, enable dialogue and exchange of knowledge, through culture and heritage, expressed as artefacts. Initially, this exchange will be between five Countries in Southern Africa and the UK. 

This first phase of network-building is working towards addresses the United Nations (UN) Sustainable development challenge goals to end poverty, Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all and promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all.

The proposed network and associated research is aligned with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development's compliance statement point (i) of &amp;quot;promoting economic growth and welfare of developing countries&amp;quot;. All of the five SAFOD representatives are recipient countries on the DAC list.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research network will facilitate communication between individual crafts people, disability support groups in Southern Africa Regions and the UK. The mixed methods approach will enable discussion and exchange of knowledge, skills, techniques, values and cultural perspectives around inclusive craft design and making. A 'bottom up' based approach to the definition of needs and aspiration will lead to a better understanding of the needs and aspirations in the Southern African regions by international aid agencies.

The integration of individuals with disabilities into their communities through arts, craft and design will have a significant impact on their way of life. This will be achieved through reframing the value of individuals in generating income for their family and wider community; resulting in enhanced status. 
Highlighting to other parts of the world the rich culture and heritage of the communities, through the artefacts produced, will provide the opportunity for sustainable economic development. 

Legacy 
The needs requirements and aspirations of the communities will be presented to potential interested crafts and associated academic partners in a one-day workshop, held at the Loughborough University campus in London. The report, associated research and conference papers will act as a resource on which craftspeople, supported by academic partners, will identify future projects. The heavy emphasis on dialogue and exchange of knowledge and culture matches the overall aim of the Network proposal. 

A longer-term stakeholder engagement plan will be developed by the partnership to ensure the appropriate individuals are liaised with to support wider impact of the project both within the partner countries and beyond in order to achieve impact in the wider developing world.

The network will expand to include other developing countries and become a long-term global network, providing templates and exemplars for ways of working for people living with disability and helping to reframe perceptions within their communities.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>44307</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/R004307/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>62F4842F-55F4-41C6-A77A-572005E91429</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Community Art inc A &amp; H</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0BD15AF-D726-4525-A824-5C01385833D3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ethnography &amp; Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
