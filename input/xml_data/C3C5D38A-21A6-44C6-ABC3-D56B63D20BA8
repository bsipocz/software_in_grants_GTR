In order to do this we need to facilitate a cultural change within the profession from tacit values and 'Archispeak' to evidence, research and clear communication. Our particular emphasis is on social value in the context of homes and neighbourhoods, but the project will have wider applicability to other sectors of the built environment. 

It is not widely known that architects have very little involvement in the production of our built environment. Some 30% of planning applications are by architects, only 30% of architecture students go on to qualify as architects and the average pay of an architect is &amp;pound;36K with the majority of architects being employed by building contractors. Architects have become extremely marginal, not helped by negative perceptions of the profession. How can architects, who have had seven years of dedicated training making them well suited to help address spatial dimensions of the 'Grand Societal Challenges', be more included in the production of homes and neighbourhoods? In the UK there is very little understanding of the benefits that architectural skillset bring to the built environment - strategic, creative, spatial thinking - meaning that architects rarely have the chance to utilise their painstakingly and expensively developed skill set for the benefit of society. The results are there for everyone to see but are most notable in the extremely poor quality of Volume House Building in the regions. 

This project builds on two previous AHRC projects Home Improvements Knowledge Exchange in the Creative Economy and The Cultural Value of Architecture in Homes and Neighbourhoods (CVoA) which allowed us to propose a framework for eidencing value in this context. These projects also persuaded us of the need to convince those business clients with the greatest resources at their disposal of the need to employ Architects.

The project explores the image and value of Architects from a range of different viewpoints, beginning with the UK profession itself before moving on to the business clients who might employ them and to the non-architect Academics who assess their work (and sometimes commission buildings). The research will be used to open up the field of Architecture to academics interested in interdisciplinary work. We will also work with academics across Europe to develop an understanding of the perception of the field in their own countries. The outputs are similarly diverse, including a report on Pathways to Post Occupancy Evaluation, a Client's Guide to Architects, an edited book on cross cultural perceptions of the architecture profession and a book on Why Architecture Matters. We are also deeply concerned with public perceptions of Architects, a highly complex area that we examined in the CVoA project, but have chosen here to focus on those most likely to commission or evaluate Architects as this is the way to achieve the most immediate impact on the profession.

This Leader Fellow project forms part of a wider three year project on Value led by Anne Dye, Director of Technical Research at the RIBA with whom the PI Samuel has a mature research relationship. The PI Samuel is an elected Council member at the RIBA and a member of its Research and Innovation Group and Housing Group and is therefore well positioned to promote the evidencing of value through Architecture Research Practice at the RIBA. Samuel is also leader of the interdisciplinary Home research group in the Faculty of Social Sciences at the University of Sheffield. The Leader Fellow project will enable to develop the research capacity of this group into Europe and beyond.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>At the broadest level we hope to impact on wellbeing via the quality of the built environment in the UK - that the built environment impacts on wellbeing and learning is becoming increasingly recognised and understood. If we can disaggregate, evidence and evaluate what Architects do we are in a better position to make the case to policy makers and funders that they need to pay for these skills. As Bentre Frost, mayor for city planning in Copenhagen, the 'world's most livable city, ' stated: &amp;quot;Without the many studies from the School of Architecture, we politicians would not have had the courage to carry out the many projects to increase the cities attractiveness&amp;quot;(Gehl &amp;amp; Svarre 2013, p.157).

Although the Construction Industry is a major contributor to the UK economy it is well known for lack innovation as recent reports by Egan and Calcutt have shown. It is also notoriously adversarial. In developing Architecture Research Practice and in forging links between practice and academia we are developing the potential for innovation for the benefit of our economy. In promoting the Types and Skillsets we are opening the field up for the interdisciplinary work that is so badly needed, particularly in the field of housing where supply is nowhere near demand.

Architecture Profession - The Pathways to Post Occupancy Evaluation Report will provide an important new resource for Architects embarking on research. It is hoped that through the Design Quality and Performance group we will be able to make the case to Personal Indemnity Insurers that they should reduce insurance premiums for responsible research practitioners, in doing so delivering a real economic incentive for research practice. The project will give added impetus to Anne Dye and the Research arm of the RIBA, currently relatively under-resourced, in this way enabling them to send out a strong message about the importance of Architecture Research Practice. The project will contribute to the development of the RIBA Value project, giving it extra depth in terms of research rigour and credibility.

Business Clients - Our research has shown that businesses often want to invest in Architects but have difficulty making the business case for doing so. The Client Guide will help Architects to convince business clients and their boards of the importance of their input. In developing their own customised versions of the Guide SME practices will be encouraged to give more consideration to issues of value, strategy and good business practice - currently very few practices even have a business plan. The Client Guide should also prompt discussion on the importance of marketing strategy and on the ways in which Architect practices help organisations with the creation of 'identity', a very important aspect of marketing.

The project will also benefit Kernel Simpatico who are developing our Client Guide. It will allow them to expand their portfolio of activities and to deepen their understanding of the construction industry - several of their clients are manufacturers of construction components. In collaborating with academia it will also enable them to experiment with new ways of working.

Europe - Whilst our conduit to the the European Architecture profession is via the academics of ARENA and our nascent COST Action network the project will also be of use to practitioners in Europe in enabling them to contextualise the way that they work and to see the peculiarities of their own situation in relief. Most importantly the COST network will enable us to gauge the extent of Architecture Research in Practice across Europe and to ascertain how best to support European Architects who want to engage with Horizon 2020.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>201107</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>RIBA - Royal Institute of British Architects</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>RIBA</gtr:description><gtr:id>DA74F5AD-A47C-4D01-8896-55615E0029F7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Flora Samuel, Nishat Awan, Carolyn Butterworth, Sophie Handler, Jo Lintonbon, AHRC Cultural Value of Architecture in Homes and Neighbourhoods Report (July 2014).

The motion was unanimously carried with the following outcomes

Recommendation
1. That the Council support the vision and seven objectives that will be implemented through the development of a strategic plan for intelligence and innovation (which will be put to Council for approval in March 2016 following an open discussion) under the following headings:
? A strong profession
? An intelligent RIBA
? An evidence-based built environment
2. That a senior member is selected to champion this strategic priority, at Board level is possible, and to ensure integration across the RIBA (with process and timescale to be confirmed to Council in March).
Vision
By 2020 the RIBA will be the leading architectural intelligence network, facilitating innovation, and improving practice effectiveness and outcomes through research and knowledge sharing.
Objectives
The RIBA will ensure that:
1. Architects have the skills, knowledge, professional practices and support needed to practice and innovate successfully in a changing environment.
2. The skills, knowledge and professional practices of architects are understood and valued by clients, other built environment professionals, as well as society more widely.
3. The RIBA has the skills, knowledge and internal culture to ensure that its work (outputs, activities, programmes) is grounded in robust evidence.
4. Architects, the RIBA and others in the built environment can easily access relevant existing knowledge and evidence to support best-practice and innovation.
5. Architectural research - relevant to the practice of architecture - is undertaken by architects, academics, the RIBA and others concerned with the built environment, with access to funding made easier.
6. A culture that supports knowledge sharing exists across all built environment professions, academic disciplines, and industry. 
7. The built environment professions, and society more widely, have a culture that uses robust evidence as the foundation for innovation and improved outcomes in architecture and the built environment.

The seven objectives link to the three headings - a strong profession, an intelligent RIBA, and an evidence-based built environment - as an interdependent system, which will be the foundation for the delivery of the overall vision.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56bdf29588c5a1.93786557</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>RIBA Gold Research Medal Speech</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>79C2E599-929B-4F7E-9E96-043E5E93EAF9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Introduction to the new RIBA Medal for Research, an innovation by the Research and Innovation Group of which I am Chair.

research project resulted in my nomination as the Royal Institute of British Architects. Ambassador for Innovation. I put a motion to RIBA Council 1.12.2015:

'By 2020 the RIBA will be the leading architectural intelligence network, facilitating innovation and improving practice effectiveness and outcomes through research and knowledge sharing'

The motion was unanimously supported and has fed directly into the RIBA 2016-2020 Strategy 'Advancing Architecture' which now foregrounds research and innovation. https://www.architecture.com/RIBA/Aboutus/Whoweare/Corporateinformation.aspx 2016 has since been named the RIBA 'SMART Practice' year.

My research has also led to a statement from the RIBA Insurance Agency regarding the impact of building performance evaluation on insurance to be published by the RIBA in May 2016. https://www.architecture.com/RIBA/Professionalsupport/Assets/Files/RIBAPOEBPEPrimer.pdf

As part of the award I facilitated the development of a network of Research Practice Leads, the people who lead on research in architectural practices. The group now represents some 25 medium size and very large practices, meeting four times a year to develop best practice and future research. Example of feedback from Daniel Stokes 1.2.17 'Really good to meet you last Friday at the RIBA R&amp;amp;I group meeting. It was an incredibly interesting couple of hours and something that we're looking forward to exploring and developing at HLM and the wider field'.

I have also made 10 visits to architectural practices to give CPD training on research in architecture (talking to roughly 300 practitioners in the process) in doing so helping to grow the momentum of research in architectural practice. Response tweet from @GortScott on 26.1.17 'A brilliant #CPD from @FloraArchitect about research in practice - really inspiring ideas all architects should be engaging in @RIBAResearch'

I held a DR SOM symposium on Research Practice at the University of Reading attended by approximately 6o practitioners and academics from across Europe with keynotes from Doina Petrescu and Stirling Prize winner Niall McLaughlin. http://www.arena-architecture.eu/news/dr_som-reading-2016-apr-22/</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>79E9F305-1D35-4901-AFB6-E5B75C2399F9</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56bdd497809e11.15939656</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Environment,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have discovered that the 420 documents assembled by the RIBA under a call for information about the building performance evaluation contain extremely little information on the value of architects.

Building Knowledge: Pathways to POE has provided an important platform for the RIBA policy team to promote POE to government, a key strategic objective for 2017.

These findings are contributing to a study of the value of architects by the ministry of culture in France.
