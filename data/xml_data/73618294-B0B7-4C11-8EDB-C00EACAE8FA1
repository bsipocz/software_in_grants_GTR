It has widespread application to the detection and monitoring of cancer throughout the human body. However, beyond this crucial application, PET is also a powerful method for investigating problems with the human brain. It allows us to understand what is going on in dementia, epilepsy and other distressing brain disorders which afflict in excess of one million people in the UK. One specific example is PET's ability to look at the brain's inflammatory response. This inflammatory response is now recognized as linked not only with dementia and many other disorders of the brain, but is even implicated in mental health problems such as depression. Only PET can allow us to look at this inflammation at the molecular level, which means that PET has a unique role both in diagnosing and seeking to remedy these often debilitating conditions. But there are limits on just how much information we can currently gain from PET, mainly due to the noise levels in the data which limit our ability to accurately measure quantities of interest within small regions of the brain.

Recently, with a view towards the future of medical imaging, PET scanning has been made available with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in one single scanner, PET-MR. This means we can see the structure of the human body at the same time as seeing how it functions. These images come without the radiation exposure of a CT scan, possess the amazing details of MR, and in contrast to PET-CT all the medical information is obtained at the same time with the patient in the same position in one single and convenient scan. The potential of PET-MR is exciting, not only in terms of its benefits to patients and to research, but also for opening new possibilities for processing the medical imaging data. This is very relevant to PET, where problems with image noise have led many to invest considerable effort into reducing noise in the images, so that more detailed medical information can be gained. This current project seeks to go further by joining together the PET and the MR image reconstruction and processing. We will model what PET does, as well as what MR does, together, at the same time. Also, we will build high quality reference brain images which reflect a number of different functional and anatomical attributes of the human brain, based on PET and MR scans of different people. This will allow future PET-MR scans to benefit from previous knowledge, and so be more intelligent when scanning a new patient. The project will apply these special techniques to three main areas. First, to look at brain inflammation with PET, to gain insight into what is happening in people suffering from depression, especially when their medication is having no effect. Second, we will look at what is happening in the brain for people suffering from epilepsy. Finally we will also look at detecting the presence of a particular type of protein associated with Alzheimer's disease, which is highly important for both understanding and possibly resolving this urgently growing issue (the numbers of sufferers from Alzheimer's is predicted to double in the next 40 years).

The proposed developments for imaging brain disorders is very timely. Firstly, a brand new PET-MR scanner has just arrived at St. Thomas' Hospital, one of the first sites in the UK to obtain such a technologically advanced system. Secondly, brain imaging studies with this scanner will soon get underway during 2015, with a funded study already scheduled to scan 60 participants for research into mood disorders. The timing is therefore perfect for the parallel development of novel methodology suited to the unique capabilities of PET-MR. Though many have seen the potential for joining together the PET and MR data processing, none of the methods so far are as unified and advanced as put forward in this proposal.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>A) Three patient groups are poised to benefit:

1) Patients suffering from neurodegenerative disorders
Alzheimer's disease has a hidden but significant impact upon the UK. Advancing brain imaging capabilities, as proposed here by the powerful combination of PET and MR imaging hardware with innovative algorithms, will help understand progression of the disease from an early stage, providing scope for early remedial actions to be taken. Furthermore, given the key role of brain imaging in drug development, the improved functional and anatomical imaging capabilities should also help in the search for treatments for this inevitably increasing patient group, currently arising from an aging UK population.

2) Patients suffering from neuropsychiatric disorders
The proposed work will look into enhancing the image quality for a Wellcome Trust funded study into treatment-resistant depression, which will use the newly installed simultaneous PET-MR scanner at St. Thomas' hospital. Since the proposed methodology is expected to deliver improved images for analysis, this in turn will allow more information to be gathered from this study, ultimately assisting in finding answers and treatments for these more challenging depressive disorders.

3) Patients suffering from epilepsy
A further area of emphasis of this project is to generate improved images for understanding the role of the dopaminergic system in epilepsy. Epilepsy can seriously degrade quality of life and restrict normal human freedoms, and the methods to be developed in this work will ultimately also contribute to the better understanding of this disorder, and in turn, potential new ways of treating and resolving epilepsy. 

B) Wider impact:

1) The pharmaceutical and medical imaging industries
The manufacturers of the new generation of medical PET-MR imaging systems (Siemens, GE and Philips), as well as pharmaceutical companies (e.g. Lundbeck UK, Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson) are poised to benefit from the proposed work. Pharmaceutical companies can exploit improved brain imaging hardware with the software developments of this present research proposal to deliver more accurate and precise analyses during trials of new drugs. The medical imaging industry will also benefit from the developments which can both justify and showcase the considerable investment into simultaneous PET-MR imaging technology. Recently the Division of Imaging Sciences and Biomedical Engineering was awarded EPSRC funding for a Centre of Doctoral Training (CDT), and some of these studentships have collaborative funding from Siemens, including projects fitting within the auspices of this present project proposal.

2) The UK population as a whole
The advanced imaging methods to be developed in this proposal should allow new insights into the function of the human brain as well as its disorders. Given that a significant percentage of the national population will likely suffer some form of neuropsychiatric problem at some stage in life, the outcomes of this research are pertinent to literally everyone. Ultimately, better understanding of neurological and psychiatric disorders contributes to enhancing quality of life, health and the therefore also the ultimate creative output of the UK population. These impacts cannot be underestimated.

3) Cultural impact and public awareness of science
Dr. Reader retains strong links with the Montreal Neurological Institute, who initiated projects such as &amp;quot;NEURO PORTRAIT: The Brain Inspires Us&amp;quot;, an exhibit which brings neuroscience to the public through art. In a similar fashion, since this research concerns creation of a new generation of multi-parametric medical images, these could be exploited in a highly visual and artistic manner, seizing the imagination and inspiring the next generation of researchers. Prof. Hammers also has extensive experience in the area of the public awareness of science, which will be brought to bear on the results of this research project.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>606712</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have found that there is clear potential, based on early simulation results of simultaneous multi-modality imaging, not only to improve positron emission tomography (PET) image quality using magnetic resonance (MR) data, but furthermore also to improve MR images (when using undersampled data) using PET data. We have found that synergistic PET-MR reconstruction is therefore feasible, giving imaging results which would not be achievable if each modality were used in isolation.
Also, with use of MR data during PET image reconstruction, image quality can be significantly improved, and this improvement can in principle be used instead to lower the amount of injected radioactivity to achieve standard diagnostic image quality at a much lower radiation dose to the patient.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>These findings might have potential to open the way
