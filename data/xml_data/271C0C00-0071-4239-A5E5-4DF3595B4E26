At present, there exists no in-depth study, and certainly no comprehensive up-to-date historical survey of Persian poetry during these two centuries (roughly the 14th-15th centuries) when most the models of classical Persian poetry were perfected, and during which many major Persian poets flourished. The main focus of the project will be a monograph focusing on several themes found in these poets: 

- The intertextual relationship of the poets to contemporaries and predecessors 
- Sufi terminology and symbolism in their works
- Bachannalian and wine symbolism
- Poetic Genres and their typology 
- The 'Indian Style' (Sabk-i Hindi) and the 'Realist School' (Maktab-i Voqu') movements and the poets of the Timurid and T&amp;uuml;rkmen Periods,
- Eroticism and doctrines of love, both profane and sacred
- The influence of Ibn 'Arabi's (d. 1240) theomonism on Persian poetry of the period 
- The political-historical background and socio-cultural milieu of poetry during the period 

The book will be divided into five basic chapters. 
The introduction will outline the academic methodology, historical chronology, and present a survey of bibliographical sources and the research questions asked by the book.
An initial chapter (one) will be devoted to a review of the life and verse of eight of great classical Persian poets of the thirteenth century who lived during the Mongol period, namely: Nizami (d. 1202), 'Attar of Nishapur (d. 1221), Rumi (d. 1273), and 'Iraqi (d. 1289), Sa'di (d. circa 1292), Humam-i Tabrizi (d. 1314-15), Nizari Quhistani (d. 1321), and Awhadi Maraghi (d. 1337-8). 
Chapter two will focus on the key poets who flourished in Shiraz, under or immediately following Muzaffarid rule (1353 to 1392) there, namely: Khwaju Kirmani (d. after 1352), 'Imad al-Din Faqih Kirmani (d. 1371), bayd-i Zakani (d. 1370), Hafiz (1317-791/1389), and Bushaq At'amah-i Shirazi (d. 1423 or 1427). This chapter will also explore the work of other important poets from other areas of Timurid Persia, in particular: Salman Savaji (d. 1376), and Kamal Khujandi (d. 1400).
Chapter three will cover the major and minor Persian Sufi poets of the School of Ibn 'Arabi who lived during the Timurid period, namely: Shah Ni'matullah Wali (d. 1431), Adhari Tusi (d. 1461), Shah Da'i Shirazi (d. 1464-5), Jami (d. 1492) and Muhammad Lahiji (&amp;quot;Asiri,&amp;quot; d. 1506-7). I will stress the literary school in the city of Tabriz in the province of Adharbaiyan in the work of the Mongol period-poet Mahmud Shabistari (d. after 1340), Muhammad Shirin Maghribi (d. 1408), Qasim-i Anwar (d. 837/1433), and Mashriqi Tabrizi (d. 1454), 
Chapter four will be devoted to some of the other poets of late Mongol and Timurid Persia Part one will revisit the poetic achievement of 'Abd al-Rahman Jami. Part two will be devoted to the other, lesser known (but not always minor) poets of 15th century Timurid and T&amp;uuml;rkmen Persia, such as: 'Ismat-i Bukhara'i (d. 1425-6), Bushaq At'amah-i Shirazi (d. 1423 or 1427), Katibi-yi Nishapuri [or Turshizi] (d. 1434-35), Khiyali Bukhara'i (d. 1446), 'Arifi of Herat (d. 1449), and Mir Shahi Sabzawari (d. 1453).
Chapter five will draw conclusions and provide answers to the research questions posed in the book's introduction.
The project will be also accompanied by a one-day workshop on the poets of the Timurid and T&amp;uuml;rkmen periods. The workshop's papers will be uploaded to an University of Exeter website dedicated exclusively to the project, in order to prepare the ground for the published monograph as well as serve as a platform to launch an edited volume on the subject by its contributors at a later date (although this volume does not form part of the present proposal).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>As can be seen from the Case for Support, this project is focused on research leading to a book that will largely benefit the academic community. However, its impact will not be solely 'academic' since both the book and the accompanying workshop have the wider aim of opening up the field of classical Persian literature to the general public. Outside the two mainstream authors (Hafiz and Jami), most of the poets explored in the monograph remain unknown in the West (it might be added that they are hardly better known in the Persian-speaking world). Therefore, an entire world of classical Persian literature, utterly unexplored and unexploited, remains inaccessible except to specialists at present, with its most important writers and poets and their highly original lyrical and epic works being considered as negligible, frivolous, tawdry sideshows beside the grand narrative of the &amp;quot;Western Canon.&amp;quot; This situation is unacceptable. Persian literature features what one of the greatest traditions of mystical poetry in any of the world's literatures, so obviously the exposure of its major and minor figures is of immediate and urgent relevance to both the general public and the academic community. 

Furthermore, not only is there a dearth of studies in any European language on any of the important minor Persian poets mentioned in my proposal, there is not even one single study of the lyric and epic verse of greatest poet of the latter part of the period (Jami) in English. Not one of his major poetic works has yet received a serious critical translation into English! Although it is true that an 18-volume series on Persian literature has been recently launched in the United States, under the directorship of Ehsan Yarshater, assisted by an international team focusing particular themes and names, this massive History of Persian Literature will not be finished for many decades, and its recondite nature and encyclop&amp;aelig;dic size will discourage the general public's access. The present wrk, on the other hand, because it is focused chronologically on specific poets and poetic styles and movements, has the potential to open an entirely new chapter in the field of Persian Literature studies in particular and world literature in general. While my edited volume on Hafiz and the Religion of Love in Classical Persian Poetry (2010) attempted to make the first major study in English of the grandest figure (Hafiz) in classical lyrical Persian poetry, this project will bring out the relevance of the lesser-known poetic figures of this period and place them in historical and literary context - and thus broaden the field for scholar and layman alike.

Since the works of some of the major and minor poets of the period were illustrated by prominent Persian miniaturists, the book will also be of use to art historians and sold in galleries and museums that exhibit Islamic art. Persian poetry is hardly a niche subject in the West anymore so of course there will also be a broader general audience interested in this subject. By way of example, The Angels Knocking on the Tavern Door: Thirty Poems of Hafez, translated by the American award-winning poet Robert Bly and myself, has enjoyed high sales in the US since its publication by HarperCollins in 2008. The present work is similarly meant to serve as a feasibility study to gauge whether publication of a popular literary translation of significant minor poets such as Kamal Khujandi or Hilali Chughata'i (examined in the monograph) would be in the public interest.

The workshop on poets of the Timurid and T&amp;uuml;rkmen Periods, the first on this subject in either Iran or the West, again will open up a new area of studies to literary researchers. The workshop and its accompanying website, to which the workshop's papers will be uploaded, are designed to prepare the ground for the published monograph as well as serve as a platform to launch an edited volume on the subject by its contributors at a later date.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>41966</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>There have been many important findings concerning medieval Persian poetry that I have made.
