The study comprised two parts: A) The UK Taxonomy and Systematics Review, which provides quantitative data on the current state of the subject in the UK, as requested by the Science &amp;amp; Technology Committee. This was conducted by a team from the Natural History Museum led by Professor Geoff Boxshall; B) A document, Developing a National Strategy in Taxonomy &amp;amp; Systematics, exploring the need for a national strategy in this area and how it might be developed. This was written by an independent group of nine scientists working in taxonomy and cognate areas chaired by Professor Charles Godfray. It makes nineteen strategic recommendations about how the UK taxonomy and systematics sector can be strengthened to ensure the future health of the discipline.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>108000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>This was a contract to review the state of taxonomy and systematics in the UK.

1. A national strategy in taxonomy and systematics should be developed
2. A UK Taxonomy Co-ordination Committee (TCC) should be set up to develop and review the National Strategy in Taxonomy and Systematics
3. Science spend in taxonomy should be categorised as National Capability, Research Programme or Responsive Mode
4. Investment in national capability in taxonomy and systematics by different bodies should be recognised as such and its levels monitored
5. A study should be undertaken to determine whether the distribution of the UK's taxonomic collections is the most efficient for today's needs
6. There is no viable funding model for collections in universities and HEFCE should work with HEIs to resolve this situation (which may involve collection consolidation and transfer)
7. Moves to collection digitisation should continue with investment concentrated on priority resources
8. As part of a co-ordinated global programme major taxonomic organisations should take the responsibility for leading the provision of resources for particular taxa
9. For most groups molecular and morphological taxonomic approaches should advance together though for certain microorganisms concentration on molecular approaches (as has happened with bacteria) will be most efficient
10. The TCC should co-ordinate the development of a costed road map to provide appropriate identification tools for all UK organisms
11. Taxonomy in support of conservation in the Overseas' Territories should be considered
a priority for UK Taxonomy &amp;amp; Systematics Strategy
12. NERC should continue to support PhD training in taxonomy and assess the consequences of its recent decision to stop supporting taught masters
13. NERC should take the lead in addressing a deficit in training in taxonomy for micropalaeontology which is of great concern to the private sector
14. NERC should explore whether lack of training opportunities is the reason for the difficulty in recruiting trained taxonomists by environmental consultancies
15. All organisations receiving funding for national capability in taxonomy should include in their remit the facilitation of volunteer scientists
16. Provision of small grants for volunteer scientists and recognition of their contributions by learned societies and other bodies should be encouraged
17. The TCC should bring together the UK taxonomic community to list and prioritise time limited
major research programmes or &amp;quot;grand challenges&amp;quot; that would advance UK taxonomy and systematics
18. The Research Councils should continue to provide competitive funding to support excellent science involving taxonomy that comes within their remits and ensure their committees contain the appropriate expertise
19. NERC and BBSRC (and where relevant MRC) should ensure their support of taxonomy is coordinated and complementary</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>NERCF compiled a response to the recommendations:
