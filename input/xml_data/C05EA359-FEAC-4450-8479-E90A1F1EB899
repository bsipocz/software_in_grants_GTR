I have also been brought basic chemistry, physics and thermodynamics to a number of areas not normally treated in this way by the general public - beer, cocktails, coffee, curry etc. and presented science slots in television series devoted to food. On the strength of the contacts I have built I would like to expand the work I have done so far and focus more on being an advocate for chemistry. I have four major directions in mind. 1. To talk about carbon dioxide and its relation to energy (The E-Word) in our world and in particular to try to put ideas about energy into context and provide a sense of scale by making driect comparisons between everyday energy uses.2. To talk about mercury and our love/hate relationship with it. Mercury has played a role in almost every major discovery in the physical sciences between the 17th and the mid 20th century. It was also widely used in medicine. Yet its toxicity was something of which even the ancients were aware. I would like to use mercury as a classic example of the trade-off between costs and benefits in technology.3. To talk about molecules and the extent to which their properties and their technology permeates our lives. This would be a direct development from the two BBC4 series Atom and Elements. 4. To talk about the materials that lie at the heart of objects and devices in the everyday world. This would complement the recent series Atom and Elements whilst in a sense be more closely tied in with the interests of the broader population. We would ask questions about where the materials come from and how they are made, and how our choices and demands have political, environmental, and economic implications in the world. 5. I will continue to discuss chemistry, physics and materials science in everyday contexts, particularly developing the Science of Cocktails sessions that I recently started hosting.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The impacts from my fellowship are likely to be largely intangible yet significant. My aim is to help bring scientific questions more into the mainstream of everyday culture. The issues associated with climate change and new technology on the other face us with significant dilemmas and choices. The decisions that are taken now will have resonances for decades to come. It is crucial therefore that we bring scientific issues alive and help inform some of the choices that need to be made. If we do not stand up and explain the science and the implications of our technology together with the fact that we have to accept some negative consequences not matter what choice we take, then the decisions will be swayed and driven by interest groups able to exploit the lack of a scientific culture in the population as a whole. My aims are to have an impact at a national level, by getting people interested in areas of basic science not normally shown on television. A key part of this will be by showing them the extraordinary behaviour of ordinary things. I intend to combine television programming with accompanying web material to extend the reach of anything I present, since ultimately web pages have a much longer lifetime. A second impact is in work with children, for example via Gastronuts which gets huge audiences on CBBC. Because children tend to decide which subjects they prefer around age 11, this is a key target group. My plan is to encourage wider impact of these contributions by providing accompanying web material to go with the material I present on the programme. A third area is to encourage members of my department to interact more with the media and this has been rising over the past two years. I am pushing students to produce more videos for the web. My activities will help to encourage the importance of this kind of work in colleagues both within my own department and beyond.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>114441</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Multiple film appearances on BBC4</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>527E42EF-E4AB-4506-9A53-265C048B1A5E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Consultant and/or contributor for Chemistry: A Volatlie History, The Secret Life of Chaos, Everything and Nothing, Order and Disorder, and several other series presented by Jim Al Khalili

However, the underlying, unspoken theme, is climate change and the future of our world without however mentioning the words &amp;quot;climate change&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;greenhouse effect&amp;quot; and so on. The idea is to catch people unawares and to generate an emotional response to the inexorable changes in our world without however using trigger words that will produce pushback.
That talk has been given to schools audiences, with &amp;quot;homework&amp;quot; for teachers to link up the curricula in science, in history and in geography. But it has also been extremely well received by general audiences. Elements of the talk have been used repeatedly on radio.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c91f2f67ed79.23757256</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015,2016,2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Multiple appearances at Science Festivals other than Cheltenham</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FE7F9DA8-81A3-4373-8A0D-E9CC2605713F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Many talks given at Edinburgh, Cambridge, Manchester and other science festivals on the subjects including food chemistry, ice, chemistry of pattern formation, lanthanide chemistry etc etc</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56deecbe21cd32.12945315</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2006,2007,2008,2009,2010</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>I now have a very significant national profile with the media and in schools as a result of the activities that I conducted during the fellowship.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2007</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>D1E6C539-E7E4-41D9-A652-4DB6CD8535ED</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56def0e257b785.28710696</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Membership of UCL Environmental Sustainability Steering Group</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2E9C798A-A69E-4500-960E-7A98D71BC423</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Since 2011 I have been a member of UCL's Environmental Sustainability Steering group, a fairly direct consequence of my Media Fellowship and prominence in bringing energy and sustainability to radio and television programmes.. Over this period I have worked closely with colleagues to develop policies to reduce the environmental impact of the College activities. This has included driving the roll out of remote metering and telemetry of our operations and ensuring that these issues have been embedded into the agenda and decision-making of the institution as a whole. We have driven forward significant student and staff involvement in behaviour change and in planning. For example water use in my own Department has dropped by about 60%. Overall, UCL's estate's energy use has remained static against a background of a 40% increase in size. We have also embedded energy issues into both undergraduate and postgraduate teaching, linking it both to budgetary and safety issues. These discussions are now leading to wider discussions between institutions for resource and logistics sharing to both improve efficiency, but also to reduce our impact in the city. At my instigation we are starting to quantify academic travel and to consider its magnitude in relation to that of the Estate.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c91d2ef05596.77548529</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Membership of a guideline committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/H050671/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>863FC58A-7217-42EA-B076-663F2D770BB8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical measurement</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F95121C7-7C31-40CE-BDBC-1E2BF025AEA6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Energy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E847DD9B-2053-4BC7-97A9-4213B185C968</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6723A70B-A523-40AB-9740-B6AD2A0677B7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medical &amp; health interface</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1820CCC5-B4C4-47E9-B81F-8F49AC606F0E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical Structure</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BE7CEC14-3FA2-49BC-89EE-062447C269C1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Energy Efficiency</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>561091A1-9FC9-4508-B1B2-2F3623E1FC9D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials Characterisation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E48C802F-8897-4353-910A-09D09331BB82</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medical science &amp; disease</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
