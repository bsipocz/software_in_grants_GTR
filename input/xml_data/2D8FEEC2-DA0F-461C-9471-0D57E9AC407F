Recent developments create new challenges. New immigration arrangements following Brexit are likely to make it harder for the UK to access international talent in order to fill skill gaps. In addition, there is a risk that multinationals will find the UK a less attractive destination for investment post Brexit - aside from the direct impact this would have on UK jobs and investment, this is of concern since it has been shown that there are positive spillover effects (both in terms of superior management practices and higher productivity in general) from multinationals to their surrounding firms. Technological change and new working arrangements (such as the rise in self-employment and the &amp;quot;gig economy&amp;quot;) are likely to reduce the incentives for firms to train, and policy makers must consider how to ensure that workers are appropriately trained and able to adapt to changes in the labour market.

Under this fellowship, I will investigate in more detail the relationship between different types of skills and firm performance, including management practices, and how the skill needs of British businesses can be met in the future. In particular, I will focus on the following projects:

A. Skills, Organisational Practices and Productivity

1. Human capital, skills and productivity: Firm level analysis will explore the value of different types of skills to business, building datasets and searching for causal research design, and I will also work on a project synthesising what we know about the role of higher education in industrial strategy with respect to improving outcomes for individuals and firms.
2. Business support policies to improve skills and management practices: I would seek to work together with the What Works Centre for Local Economic Growth and willing business partners to find an opportunity to design and evaluate a randomised control trial which would test differing levels of training or other business support interventions.
3. Skills to support new labour market structures and methods of delivery: Based on business or individual survey data, it is possible to ascertain which types of skills will be important to building human capital and labour market adaptability in these contexts. During the fellowship I would like to scope the possibility of a new survey amongst businesses to shed more light on these issues. 

B. Understanding the UK Economy

1. Mapping UK Economic Performance: Following on from my previous work on the LSE Growth Commission, I plan to continue work to analyse and understand the differences in economic performance across geography and industrial sectors. 
2. Clean Growth and Innovation: I plan to work with CEP and Grantham Institute for Climate Change colleagues on a project that will examine how the low-carbon transition required to fulfil national and international climate change commitments can support and enhance growth opportunities in the UK.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research findings and outputs from this work programme will be used to inform and support the Industrial Strategy through active dialogue and dissemination with policymakers, media, businesses and other stakeholders. While the longer term outputs from the academic work will be peer reviewed journal publications, in the shorter term, I will produce working papers or policy reports as set out above. 

In recent years I have had extensive contact with policymakers working on productivity and industrial strategy, through invited seminars, events, roundtables and meetings. During this fellowship, I will build on my established links with BEIS, HM Treasury, Cabinet Office and other relevant stakeholders hosting events/seminars or meetings as appropriate. I am keen to collaborate with willing business partners, or businesses and organisations working in this space - such as education providers, education technology firms or consultancy firms more generally. 

In order to aid dissemination to relevant stakeholders and the wider public, I will work with the impact team at the LSE Centre for Economic Performance to put together short-term multimedia outputs (blogs, videos) and articles for the in-house magazine, Centrepiece or other publications. I have been interviewed in the broadcast and print media on the topic of productivity and industrial strategy numerous times and I will continue to be responsive to relevant media requests. Together with the other ESRC Innovation Fellow, I plan to help build the new CEP industrial strategy website, with links to relevant work and blogs.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-01-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-01-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>342454</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/S001735/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>50992D59-4D34-4EAD-9A21-B3ADAF426DA1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Industrial Organisation (R&amp;D)</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
