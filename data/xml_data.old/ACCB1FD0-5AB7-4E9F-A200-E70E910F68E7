Yet recent years have been difficult for venues. These challenges are felt particularly keenly by the smaller venues, clubs and pubs which provide for local musicians and audiences, and which serve as the training ground for future headline acts. 
 
There is widespread interest in the live music sector, and there have been numerous reports assessing its value produced by industry organisations, policy bodies and the third sector. Nevertheless, there is still a knowledge gap about the specific relationship between the value of live music on the one hand and current challenges facing venues across the UK on the other.

Accounts of live music activity vary according to where they have been produced and according to which type of policy, industry or academic research has provided them. For instance, reports by The Scottish Household Survey, City of Edinburgh Council, Department of Media Culture and Sport, as well as those that industry bodies have commissioned, use both different definitions and parameters for what counts as live music activity. They often conflate live music with other performance activities (like theatre) or musical sources of revenue (like recording or publishing). This variation can make it difficult to make meaningful comparisons across cities, and between different types of music. It also means that the full range of settings in which live music takes place is not always properly captured by work which has a specific industry or policy focus. 

Our project will address these issues directly. The Great British Live Music Census will be a collaboration between music industry organisations, policy bodies and leading academic live music researchers. Working with key personnel in the live music sector, and building on the project team's pilot study of a census of live music in Edinburgh, we will provide the first account of live music in the UK that covers the full range of venues and that includes all types of musical activity - from amateur to top-flight professional. 
 
In conjunction with industry personnel and policymakers, our team will develop a toolkit for conducting a snapshot census of live music in three cities (Glasgow, Newcastle and Oxford) and share it with other institutions so that they can conduct parallel snapshots across the country. 
 
With project partners UK Music, the Musicians' Union and the Music Venue Trust, we will also survey musicians, venues and audience members nationwide to provide the most comprehensive dataset yet of live music in the country. 
 
Our prior research shows that different local government responses to cultural activity and venue licensing can have a profound effect on live music provision, but also that it is difficult for policymakers to make informed decisions given the variety of different definitions and parameters used in the available evidence. 
 
By bringing together industry bodies, policymakers and academics to formulate the questions and promote the surveys, this project will assist researchers, policymakers and industry alike, providing consensus on an academically rigorous methodology and subsequent dataset for assessing the scope and value of live music in the UK. This will be a large step forward for all concerned in working to safeguard and develop the cultural and economic wellbeing of this most valuable component of local character in cities and localities across the country.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The census will build on the unique connections that the research team has forged within the music industries. It has been purposely designed to facilitate knowledge exchange with the music industries, local authorities and the general public. The main targets for impact are:

LIVE MUSIC VENUES
Music venues are key cultural hubs across the UK providing entertainment, places to meet and sites for cultural exchange and business transactions. This is especially true of smaller venues which, our prior research and media commentators suggest, are vulnerable parts of the live music ecology. Few venues take time to consider the implications of their activities as cultural centres and the census will allow them to review their status here. It provides a chance for venue operators to further understand their place within the broader live music industry and to reconsider their business practices. The presence of the Music Venue Trust on our Advisory Group offers an ideal prospect for dissemination to these key, but hitherto disparate, stakeholders.

CITIES ACROSS THE UK
The census will bring clear benefits to the three primary cities in which it takes place, enabling local music businesses and policymakers to gauge the health of their live music ecology and to design strategies to support live music provision. The cities could potentially build our findings into their marketing and tourism strategies. We we will work with local agencies to forward this. Such impacts will be echoed by the parallel exercises conducted by MAP institutions using the toolkit produced by the project team.

LOCAL POLICYMAKERS
Live music is a source of potential problems (e.g. noise) and benefits (e.g. cultural diversity, economic impact) for policymakers who are often caught between competing interests, like those of residents and businesses. Our work can help decision-makers by providing a wealth of information about different practices and localities. We will consult with the representatives on our Advisory Group from the City of Edinburgh Council and Greater London Authority about dissemination.

MUSICIANS
Musicians will benefit from increased knowledge of the local and wider live music ecology. The Edinburgh census has already raised awareness of key issues and contributed to a situation where musicians are engaging with debates about the city's live music ecology. Members of our team sat on working groups with representatives from the city council's licensing and culture divisions and from the city's musicians and music industries. The pilot study informed these forums, was included in reporting by the City of Edinburgh Council and has been fed into wider discussions regarding the council's updating of its cultural policy. This research offers the opportunity to snowball this impact further.

MUSIC POLICYMAKERS
We will disseminate findings to the main music industry lobbying groups for both the UK and for Scotland (UK Music, the Scottish Music Industry Association). UK Music personnel will be on the Advisory Group. We will engage with other key bodies such as the Scottish Cultural Evidence Network, Creative Scotland, Arts Councils of England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, the Confederation of Scottish Local Authorities and the Local Government Association. Again, having the Musicians' Union on the Advisory Group, with its excellent links across the music and wider creative industries, offers obvious potential for impact.

THE GENERAL PUBLIC
Live music is now an economically dominant part of the UK's music industries. This success has been built on audiences and the fate of the UK's live music ecology often attracts media attention. This research could therefore reach beyond specialist audiences to a wider public. We will work with communications teams at participant universities to access media outlets like the BBC (which covered the Edinburgh report) and use the project website to elicit and analyse further comments from the public.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>187482</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/N008936/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>0AEFDABE-67A4-48B1-9DB4-99393BDE6065</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Music</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3BFAE48F-77C7-453F-8049-A1455B8B0E96</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Music &amp; Society</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>54D637A1-400F-4B2B-8FB4-48DF799C853C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Popular Music</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
