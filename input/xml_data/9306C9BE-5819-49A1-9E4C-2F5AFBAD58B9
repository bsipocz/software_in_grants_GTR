It explores what kinds of things dances are, what can happen to - or be done with - them. Outcomes comprise a sole-authored book, two workshops with choreographers, a public-facing website and two conference papers.\n\nDances are puzzling things, assuming they can be described as 'things' at all. Materialised in ephemeral performances, they seem to depend on the body and be constituted by its motion. And yet they can also (arguably at least) be performed again and again, by different bodies, in different spaces, even performed simultaneously in different locations. And they are not 'just' movement, but embodiments of ideas and meanings, complex traces of artistic action. Choreographed works - as opposed to the performances by which they become visible - are not physical things: they are not concrete and tangible artefacts that can be picked up, moved around, misplaced or stolen; in this respect, they are unlike (say) paintings or sculptures, though dances are (apparently, at least, and in certain cultural contexts) created, appreciated and analysed as works of art. In contrast to musical compositions (in at least some genres), dances are not routinely notated, yet they seem to depend for their re-performance on the persistence of some sorts of material trace or at least some thickness of presence in the human memory. So, what exactly is a dance?\n\nThis question is particularly urgent today, as avant-garde choreography challenges the limits of what the public accepts as dance. Eschewing conventional dance movement, structure and aesthetics, such work asks viewers to rethink both the nature of choreography and their responses as its audience. Where does this leave dance 'works' and our understanding of what they are? How, if at all, are they distinct from works of physical theatre, performance art or, indeed, any other kind of artwork? According to some commentators, contemporary choreography and recent performance studies scholarship dismantle the boundaries between art forms and disciplines, and choreography should be understood as practice which far outstrips the territory of dance. But dance still struggles for recognition as being of equal value and status with the other arts. Public understanding of what choreographers do (or in some cases, the realisation that they do anything) remains limited. This project addresses this context by examining whether we can articulate the nature of dances and choreographic works, and explain how they are distinct from other kinds of performed art work. If their nature is impossible to specify, then this has profound implications for how we produce, understand and institutionalize dance art. \n\nPhilosophy of art continues to neglect dance, although the nature of artworks, particularly musical works, has been hotly debated in the past few decades. This project redresses this neglect, examining what dances are from a variety of philosophical perspectives, and from a standpoint within dance. Dialogue with dance artists working today informs the reflection, through the two workshops with practising choreographers and a website charting the investigation's progress: both workshops and the public-facing website's discussion forum enable the developing arguments to be shaped by feedback from different audiences. A book and two conference papers will elaborate those arguments in detail, exploring the historical genesis, cultural scope and contemporary inflection of a range of relevant concepts (such as 'dance', 'ballet', 'choreographic work'). The substance of these concepts will be examined through analysis of selected works from Western theatre dance from the nineteenth century to the present day. The dances discussed being chosen for their capacity to pose philosophical questions and to help elaborate answers, the investigation will offer a developed account of what exactly dance is.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project and its findings are of potential interest to a range of beneficiaries including those working in the professional dance world. Indeed, I see the project as helping to broaden, deepen and clarify the premises of a reflection already in process in dance practice, and the dialogue with practitioners as essential in establishing the parameters of the philosophical investigation. Thus dissemination to non-academic audiences takes a dialogic form: it is not so much a top-down process, in which ideas developed in an academic environment are then published and made relevant to other potentially interested communities; rather, the ideas themselves, indeed the ground of the reflection, take shape in discussion with potentially interested parties, a discussion which continues through the medium of the project's outcomes.\n\nFor choreographers and performers, the project engages with fundamental questions about what they make, how dances are identified and what the conditions are of their persistence. Two project workshops will offer six professional choreographers opportunities to explore these issues with each other, and with me as the project's principal investigator. This discussion will then be relayed and opened to a wider constituency by a project website which includes an online discussion forum. Face-to-face and online dialogues should positively inform the philosophical investigation, but also benefit the practice of participating dance artists by contributing to their ongoing critical reflection on their own work. \n\nThe project is also, potentially, of particular interest and benefit to those who notate, document and reconstruct dances, because it explores how dances (can) persist. Other possible beneficiaries include arts policy makers, arts funding bodies, dance administrators, copyright legislators and commentators on the legal rights of artists. The project is centrally concerned with what dances are, which is clearly at issue when it comes to decisions on whether/how to promote, stimulate and fund dance production, especially in the context of increasingly interdisciplinary arts practice and diminishing resources. Similarly, the questions of who owns (the rights to) a dance, and what is needed to prove infringement of copyright, are bound up in complex ways with ontological issues. By engaging with these concerns, and encouraging relevant professionals to participate in the online discussion and read the book, the project offers to clarify the basis of these different practices. Again, the aim is to contribute positively to these professions' own critical reflection on what they do. \n\nThe dance and general arts audiences are also potential beneficiaries. Project website and a public discussion event after the end of the fellowship (probably a live discussion with one of the choreographers discussed in the book) will disseminate ideas more widely to these constituencies. The project's book outcome will also be written in a style accessible to general arts and popular philosophy publics. By enabling reflection on the nature and value of choreographic works, the project promises to enhance public understanding of choreographic practice, and thus enhance appreciation of dance art. \n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>38564</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Panel contribution</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8A05E047-38C5-40FC-A897-D5D64158C95D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I was a panellist in the closing discussiong of the &amp;quot;Beyond Application: Immanent Encounters between Philosophy and the Arts,&amp;quot; a TECHNE sponsored event, hosted by the Centre for Performance Philosophy, University of Surrey.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6bef02474f8.26590483</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.surrey.ac.uk/arts/theatre/beyond-application-immanent-encounters-between-philosophy-and-arts</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Keynote address at the Dance through the Looking Glass conference, University of Ghent, June 2012</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E0100297-7952-4D7B-9279-B2CB2289FC46</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Talk sparked debate about the nature of dance works, and issues around the loss and recovery of dance works, both during the conference and in interactions with delegates in other contexts.

Invited talks and conference presentations on the issues explored in my research have raised the profile of philosophy of dance amongst the analytic philosophical aesthetics community in the UK and the US. Publications in print have enabled access to my insights for others in my discipline and related disciplines. It is probably to early to say how others are using my findings, but I hope that they will explicitly inform the ongoing debate in the coming decades. In 2016-7, I have been invited to contribute to the discussion events around the emerging field of Performance Philosophy, participate in a panel discussion on dance and copyright, and give a keynote presentation directly related to my research on the ontology of dance works at a conference at Texas State University.

Further dissemination and impact activities are planned once the monograph which is at the centre of this project is complete and published. The book is currenty under revision following peer review of the manuscript: projected submission date to publisher is summer 2017, with a likely publication date of 2018.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>C3F25279-0CF0-401B-A9F9-F7D9F5548F94</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5464c01515b668.75293248</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>I have reflected - in a sustained and systematic way - on what dance works are: what kinds of things they are, what can happen to or be done with them. The thesis I have explored through the research is that dance works are &amp;quot;indicated action structures&amp;quot; and that this view best accounts for the roles dance works play in practices of choreography, performing, spectatorship, criticism and appreciation - how they are individuated and identified, how they persist and how they can be lost. I have also made a case for dance reconstruction as a form of historical fiction - that when dances are re-staged from patchy records after a hiatus in the performance tradition, they are better conceived as props in games of make believe about dance history than as instances of the original works. 

My research has involved also a sustained engagement with the development of the dance work concept through history, and an effor to sensitise philosophical investigation of the nature of dance to historical complexity and change. My overall argument maintains that dances from a range of periods are essentially indicated action structures, though the dance work (a &amp;quot;thicker&amp;quot; conception) is more historically specific.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>They help clarify and suggest possible answers to questions that arise for dance practitioners, in the broad sense of those engaged in choreography, performing, viewing, criticism, reconstructing, and so on. They are also relevant to the debate in the analytic philosophy of art about the ontology of artworks generally, and musical works in particular. Because dances have (in my view) different identity and persistence conditions to works in some other art forms, their ontology is both an important contribution to the wider debate and has the potential to challenge the conclusions of other domains.
