A common assumption about the folk music of Britain and Ireland is that it is based entirely on melodies, that is, tunes and songs. These are generally considered to be the core of the tradition, which can be presented with accompaniments which are optional, less important, and less historically grounded.

However, study of the notated sources presents a different picture of past practices. Rather than a variety of accompaniments being generated from a more-or-less fixed melody as happens today, hundreds of different melodies were derived from a few standard bass patterns. Even now, most of the music played at the World Pipe Band Championships is based on only four grounds. These grounds originally served as the basis for improvisation and composition, and as an aid to memory and the classification of pieces.

From the 18th century to the early 20th there was a strong tradition in Scotland of 'bass fiddling' on the cello, which also built on these patterns. Its existence has previously been hidden because the cellists were also referred to as fiddlers: they were 'bass fiddlers', alongside the 'small fiddlers' who played the violin. The similarities between patterns which underlie fiddle music and those in pibroch have not yet been explored.

Scotland's musical traditions have been highly literate as well as oral, and there is a large surviving body of written and printed evidence for these practices. But while performers of traditional music now as a matter of course consult 20th-century field recordings, it is much rarer for them to engage with the earlier records that predate the history of recorded sound. 

This project will investigate sources from the 17th to the 19th centuries, including pibroch in written canntaireachd notation, and newly-discovered fiddle manuscripts, to determine how and to what extent grounds were the primary means of generating repertoires and characterised their performance. Classification of these sources by function, and analysis of their musical content to unravel layers of fixed structures and possible techniques of improvisation, will help to demonstrate how pipe and fiddle melodies were generated, and what bass fiddlers played.

Beyond this scholarly work, a team of specialist musicians from the worlds of traditional and early music will develop historically-informed performance styles and practices, finding vocabularies of fiddle accompaniment and of improvisation that find their inspiration in the historical evidence. In performances, recordings, formal workshops and informal sessions, the musical results will be shared with today's professional and amateur musicians, encouraging them to develop their skills in new ways consistent with the history of their traditions, and to contribute feedback and interaction with the research as it progresses, resulting in richer musical choices for players and audiences.

One of the barriers to understanding the wealth of history behind traditional music is the difficulty that the non-specialist musician or busy touring professional has in accessing original historical material. The project will therefore provide a substantial web resource of musical sources and their interpretation, with a focus on making the unfamiliar and challenging aspects of the inheritance accessible to all. The contrast between past and present realities only underlines the music's vigour and adaptability, through changing climates in society and culture.

The aim is to enable creators of music in all traditions to develop a deeper understanding of the structures that underpin Scottish fiddle and pipe music, and to empower the traditional music industry to develop its distinctive character through a deeper, more widespread appreciation of the diversity of its roots.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Key beneficiaries of the research will be professional musicians working in Scottish traditional music and related areas. Scotland itself has a thriving community of folk musicians, but there is also a substantial Scottish traditional music industry across North America, and the British army has left a legacy of connected piping communities on every continent. From the interaction with historical material which relates directly to their specialism, musicians will gain creative stimulus, and be encouraged to develop their practice further. In particular, those who work within the non-melodic aspects of the music (and in many modern performances of fiddle music these are in the majority) will have access to a renewed sense of ownership and engagement with the traditions whose music they carry into the present. 

Direct peer-to-peer knowledge exchange with professional and emerging professional musicians in Scotland is built into the timetable of the research programme, via Distil workshops and the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland; musicians further afield will benefit from access to the web-based archival resource, which is to be published in year 3. The Scottish Government ministerial working group on the traditional arts identified the availability of archival resources as a need in its January 2010 report (http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/300460/0093769.pdf, 35), and the printed material in this resource will complement the AHRC-funded Inventory of Intangible Cultural Heritage at Napier University.

At a professional level, many Scottish traditional musicians regularly collaborate with those in related musical areas, whether with other traditions particularly in Europe and South America, or in cross-genre projects with jazz and electronic dance music. As a result, the historically-derived principles will have an impact outside their strictly historical musical parameters. Most also teach regularly at summer schools, festivals and f&amp;egrave;isean, in conservatoirs and colleges, and in local council-run initiatives, and this oral dissemination will continue well after the project itself is complete. Engagement with amateur musicians will deepen meaningful participation in Scottish traditional music, encouraging community cohesion between those musicians concerned with the melodic layer and those who play 'accompanying' instruments, and will enable pipers to develop a more personal means of expression in pibroch. 

Record companies, distributors and retailers of online and physical product will directly benefit from the production and sale of the two recordings to be completed in year 3 of the project. 

The audience for Scottish traditional music is large and varied, and this project will contribute to a wider understanding of the music's range and character, will challenge some of its cultural clich&amp;eacute;s, and will also enable an enriched musical context for Scottish country dancing. This broad audience will be engaged through broadcasts, performances, recordings and online content, and the project will actively seek publicity for these outputs in the music press, broadcast media, in specialist web newsgroups, and through the universities' press offices.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-10-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>375794</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Variations on a Scottish traditional ground for Flute, Clarinet, Bassoon, Trumpet, Horn, Trombone &amp;amp; Double Bass</gtr:description><gtr:id>1293EA77-4DA9-4037-9972-A54FE50C52BF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>One of five compositions shortlisted for a Britten Sinfonia / BBC Radio 3 commission, performed by members of the Britten Sinfonia in March 2013.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5461f84ce33986.52163482</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Hebridean Light</gtr:title><gtr:type>Composition/Score</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A performance by Nathaniel Gow's Dance Band at the Cottier Chamber Project in Glasgow on 19 June 2015, incorporating dancers from the Traditional Dance Forum of Scotland, and audience participation.</gtr:description><gtr:id>60F98BD0-E78C-4CF4-BE82-B6FCDCE4061D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This trial performance has led to the setting-up of a regular historical ceilidh dance night in Glasgow, due to begin in autumn 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dec595ceef41.00241401</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Cottier Chamber Project performance</gtr:title><gtr:type>Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.cottierchamberproject.com/ccp/gig/Concerto_Caledonia/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A performance as the finale of National Chamber Music Day in Glasgow, with participation from Syrian and other refugee and migrant groups.

Their new-found willingness to take the details of the sources seriously challenged their musical habits and their notions of tradition, and their new opinions and practices are already being disseminated further within the traditional music community through the agencies of collaborators, students and informal music-making.

Making sources freely available in digital form has also encouraged amateur musicians to use them purely as a new source of historical repertoire. We anticipate that the findings of the project will find their way into musical culture at several levels: in folk music sessions played for leisure and enjoyment, in the commercial products of professionals, and as part of the heritage industries more broadly.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>7590E455-5D5D-4A49-BDBA-7AE424EE57CB</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56e058c00b3173.98338405</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project has demonstrated that the peculiar bass traditions which are recorded in early printed sources of Scottish fiddle music are useful and convincing in musical practice, both for their own sake and for the accompaniment of dancing, and that these represent a form of cello accompaniment which remained a part of Scottish dance music for 150 years. The findings call into question the usual assumption that the most traditional and valuable elements of British folk music reside in the uppermost melody line.

There is a subtle interplay between vernacular and more studied classically-influenced bass traditions in the sources, and this relationship went through a number of changes of emphasis, shaped by musical and societal trends. The 1780s brought the piano to Edinburgh, where Scotland's music publishing was mostly based, and this instrument's influence quickly permeated the published music, largely for commercial reasons. By the 1840s, music publishers were giving less attention to unmediated rural forms of music, preferring to present Romanticised accounts of the musical material.

Pibroch's most obscure and challenging aspects - its Gaelic terminology, its idiosyncratic notations, its unfamiliar compositional processes and the complex relationships between its 314 pieces and their variants - have now been documented with rigour and illuminated with an awareness of other contemporary musical cultures. Its technical and compositional approaches were found to be suited to a range of early instruments (bird-bone pipes, lyre, wire-strung harp, medieval fiddle and hurdy gurdy) for which repertoire was previously more limited, or in one case non-existent.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Historical research into what is now considered Scottish traditional music is still in its early stages, but the project has already helped to provide a focus for an international community of scholars and scholar-performers, sharing their early findings and encouraging others to explore the history of Scottish musical traditions.

Historical musicologists, ethnomusicologists and music educators may give greater prominence to Scottish Gaelic piping in literature and classroom teaching at all levels. Its parallels with other cultural traditions, living and historical, may be used to help shift historiographies towards non-nationalist perspectives, increasing awareness of international interactions and hybridity, and challenging the use of 'traditional' music to fortify nationalist identities and political agendas.

The fiddle music database at www.HMS.scot makes a large body of musical and bibliographic data readily available for analysis and exploration, and is already being used as a key resource by postgraduate students at the University of Glasgow, examining individual sources and larger corpuses of material within the data. 

The pibroch concordance work and analysis of approaches to notation prepares the ground for empirical research in which hypotheses could be tested on encoded material. The organisers of pibroch competitions (an international sport established in 1781) might use the findings to refresh the rules of play, in particular the judging criteria, to encourage a greater diversity of musical practice. 

www.altpibroch.com is being used globally by professional and amateur performers of Highland bagpipe and other instruments, with beginner and advanced musicians adapting and reworking pibroch materials in inventive ways. Similarly, professional and amateur musicians have been employing the www.HMS.scot database from its first day online, playing and learning from the early sources, and using both the musical material itself and the principles of its construction to develop their own music. This has the potential to infuse the traditions of an already healthy and popular musical community with otherwise obscure material from early in its own history, and for the results to reach a broad audience.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B764AE11-9EDA-40DD-AF84-F3581C970FE6</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e058767625c5.74427771</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://hms.scot</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>This database includes bibliographical and summary details of over 200 printed sources of Scottish fiddle music from before 1850.
