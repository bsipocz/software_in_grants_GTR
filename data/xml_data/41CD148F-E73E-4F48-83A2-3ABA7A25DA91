The study aims to trace the implications of this transition in order to develop inclusive teaching and learning practices and support mechanisms in universities, as well as to make an international audience aware of the influence of rural life on higher education, and how this influence plays out in Southern Africa as a specific region. The research will make significant contributions to debates on widening participation, equity, social justice and post-colonial curricula in higher education across Southern Africa and more widely across the Global South. The study should shed light on the many misconceptions and stereotypes about rural existence, but in addition, explore the extent to which there are real constraints as well as opportunities provided by living in rural areas. It will also investigate how the students strategise to manage the constraints they have experienced and strengths they possess. In order to ensure context-sensitivity and sustainability, a participatory research approach will be adopted. This involves the training of a select group of students to document their own experiences as researchers, using personal documentaries created using iPads, engaging in dialogue with lecturers and administrators at key moments in the project. Three research strategies are key to the project: the first is an advanced literature review and a scrutiny of publically available documentation on macro-trends and socio-economic indicators on rurality. The second is the training of 48 second-year students in the humanities and the science and technology fields to become educational researchers. The students will document their prior learning in rural areas and their experience as university students, as well as how they negotiate the transition, and what social and technological resources they draw upon. This will be accompanied by interviews with administrators and academics in order to obtain a varied perspective on this transition, and to ascertain if there are examples of good practice to draw upon. This data collection will take place at the universities of Johannesburg, Rhodes and Fort Hare, which represent a range of South African higher education institutions, all with students from rural backgrounds. The third strategy is to share the interim findings and the research methods with academics and academic developers from Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The purpose is to engage in dialogue on the research methodology, the interim implications for developing post-colonial learning and teaching, and to ascertain to what extent these findings are common to the Southern African region. Academic developers and academics from these countries belong to an academic development network, the Southern African Universities Learning and Teaching (SAULT) forum. The network will allow for the use of the findings in the entire region. Attention will be paid to the capacity of the researchers within South Africa and the SAULT forum, including support for conducting similar research in the region and for academic writing. The mainly qualitative data will be analysed using thematic and narrative analysis. The themes informing the analysis are broadly drawn from socio-cultural theories of teaching and learning, with an emphasis on practices. This includes attention to the contexts in which students learn, the material conditions as well as cultural practices, the interrelationships amongst individuals and groups, and the formation of student identities. The proposed study benefits from a strong and practised collaboration between academics at the universities of Johannesburg, Bristol and Brighton, with expertise in teaching and learning in higher education, social inclusion, digital technologies and participatory research methods.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project benefits from working with an established academic development network, the SAULT forum with members from South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe. SAULT, an Academic Development network of 31 members, convened by Leibowitz,the SA PI, is a Special Interest Group of the Higher Education Learning and Teaching Association of South Africa (HELTASA) and is supported by the International Consortium for Educational Development (ICED). It acts as a support network for academic development and research in the region. SAULT will be a major vehicle for cascading the outcomes from the research conducted in the three universities in South Africa to the universities represented within the forum enabling wider impact throughout Southern Africa. Our plans are designed to support the co-production of knowledge with the SAULT forum in order to maximise the economic and social impact of the research. The SAULT forum and the combined research teams will work together throughout the project. SAULT will contribute to the conceptualisation and development (for example, understandings of rurality, regional differences in higher education and curriculum design) and the resultant changes to policy and practice.
 
The main beneficiaries are likely to be:

Students from rural areas in Southern Africa: a major aim of the research is to ensure greater understanding of these students' transitions to higher education and identification of the practices that shape their learning in the face of higher education curricula that remain imbued with colonialism. Gathering testimonies from student co-researchers that describe both their transitions and university experiences will enable us to propose ways to effect more successful transitions and to ensure their continued and successful participation through university. A major impact of the research, therefore, will be, through improving marginalised students' higher education experiences, to increase the numbers from rural areas entering university enabling them to make future significant contributions to the economic development of the region. Our findings will enable us to influence university support mechanisms contributing to retention and success. Student co-researchers will also gain insights and research expertise. 

Universities and academics in Southern Africa: through our consistent engagement and the co-production of knowledge with the SAULT forum, our findings will be used to support transformational change in curriculum development. More inclusive practices and policies, indentifying the knowledges privileged in particular disciplines. This will potenitally transform students' and academics' practices to ensure a more equitable learning environment.

Southern African policy makers: the research aims to identify how higher education can address some of the intransigent ways in which colonised knowledge, especially from the North is maintaining its grip and offer strategies and policy recommendations for supporting and acknoweldging the resources of students from rural backgrounds in enhancing their learning. Policy recommendations and accompanying dialogue with policymakers will serve as a means of not only contributing to a higher education environment that is more socially just but also to a more economically productive society.

Early career and established researchers: through the expertise and experience of the research team, including the UK members, early career and established researchers across Southern Africa (including SAULT) will be supported to develop the requisite skills and experience to conduct high quality research and to publish scholarly articles. This will contribute to future sustainability beyond the end of the project.

Wider general public: the research seeks to change the negative stereotypes that rural students encounter at university, increasing access, retention and equity in H</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>467335</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/P002072/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F9D6F76D-4C6C-4E36-8E06-D471DED87098</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1A4C7E39-EE28-48D9-AE87-3E028461DA42</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Elements of Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5678A899-0926-491B-8E52-E55211E3F83B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>ICT and education</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A05AA82B-96A8-4834-97FE-23963DE22DB5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Phases of education</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D2DE952A-D3A4-42AA-B3D0-37E979EBA723</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology of Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>C11BDEA9-7D9D-4728-B6A9-31032921B328</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Newton</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
