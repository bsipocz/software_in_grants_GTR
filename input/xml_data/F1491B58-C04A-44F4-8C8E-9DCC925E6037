It will contribute towards understanding of public relationships with science and technology and also provide a critical assessment of planning processes and policies.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The study on which this research is based looks at views on wind power (and energy futures), views on consultation and the planning process, and at the mechanisms of the planning process itself. It is informed by the Science and Technology Studies (STS) literature and work in sociology and political studies; and contributes in turn to each of these. A key aim of the research is to understand the experiences and perspectives of individuals and communities affected by proposed wind power developments, and particularly to understand what power local actors possess.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A qualitative case study of one proposed wind farm has been conducted, and the findings of this will be widely disseminated through the fellowship. Additionally, in order to build on the findings of the case study approximately 10 to 15 semi-structured interviews will be conducted. These interviews will focus on experiences and perceptions of the wind farm since it was granted planning permission and subsequently constructed.&lt;br />&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>73889</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Public participation in planning : challenges and opportunities</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5D35AB77-F0A9-4B15-80E8-33A0EAABD24C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This workshop was delivered for representatives of the Scottish Government (on 23rd June 2010) and for the Edinburgh City Council Planning Committee (on 28th July 2010). This sparked discussions relating to different understandings of public participation and implications for planning practice and policy.

This led to ongoing dialogue with representatives of the Scottish Government and requests for further information and participation in Scottish Government working groups.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-4448041761.7112792a96c55c</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/parliamentarians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2010</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Findings from this research have been presented to policy and industry audiences. Examples of knowledge exchange activities undertaken directly in relation to this research include:

?Delivery of workshops on public engagement in planning to representatives of the Scottish Government and Edinburgh City Council;
?Participation in Scottish Government Development Management Forum relating to planning reform;
?Production of a briefing paper relating to public engagement in renewable energy planning processes;
?Discussions with representatives of Planning Democracy;
. Publication in non-academic media (e.g. Modern Energy Review)

Following the completion of the post-doctoral fellowship my research and resulting international publications have received considerable attention leading to invitations to undertake related Scottish Government commissioned research projects, participate in Scottish Government led short life working groups relating to community engagement with renewable energy and present my research within international seminar series.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2010</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>704A5EC3-8788-444A-911B-FDA2521009A8</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545ce2a9995693.75330054</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Energy,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>My research explored the role and impact of public participation in planning processes for onshore wind farms in the UK. This included a critical review of academic literature on the topic and highlighted the need to critically reflect on key assumptions underpinning this literature and the impact of these assumptions for policy and practice. 

The research also involved primary data collection in relation to people's experiences of wind farm development and particularly relating to the provision of community benefits from wind farms. This illustrated a number of challenges encountered in the creation and management of community benefits packages. It highlighted the importance of 'trust' and 'fairness' within debates around proposed renewable energy developments, and illustrated that these concepts are complex, ambiguous and interrelated. The research found that important decisions regarding who the relevant local community is or what form community benefits should take present opportunities for disagreement between conflicting interests and that this has important implication for planning and development of renewable energy projects.

The research also explored the role of public participation in planning more broadly. It found that whilst it is often contended that public opposition represents a significant barrier to the realisation of renewable energy deployment targets, in reality the influence, or power, of such groups is limited. My research found that this is in part due to the structures of the planning system which favour &amp;quot;expert&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;professional&amp;quot; forms of participation, but also in part due to public expectations and perceptions of what counts as legitimate or credible participation and active shaping of their participation in ways which fit with these expectations.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This research has resulted in a number of peer-reviewed academic publications in international journals which are widely cited. In particular the critical approach that the research takes to the existing literature on public responses to renewable energy has been noted and is contributing to a reorienting of the literature. This is leading to greater attention to actual experiences with renewable energy planning and the role or influence of public participants.

The research is of significant relevance and value to energy and planning policy and calls for more attention to the ways in which current policy and the planning system structure and limit public participation. Research findings have been presented to planners and policy-makers resulting in ongoing dialogue about the ways in which renewable energy planning and development processes can be made more accessible, transparent and fair for members of the public.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>1D6328D3-C319-4453-ACBB-DC30823F9139</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545cecfc798b30.79915427</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Energy,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C17A9489-B4EC-4D0E-B97D-8DFB3B811DAE</gtr:id><gtr:title>Wind power and community benefits: Challenges and opportunities</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Energy Policy</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a43b9454b496afe1419782907bd3f3ad"><gtr:id>a43b9454b496afe1419782907bd3f3ad</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Aitken M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cf90f9048277b7</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A6DC68B4-F1C9-46D0-A04E-DA577552EDEC</gtr:id><gtr:title>A Three-Dimensional View of Public Participation in Scottish Land-Use Planning: Empowerment or Social Control?</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Planning Theory</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/55f87e5af27a1eb45cdb71872df1a23d"><gtr:id>55f87e5af27a1eb45cdb71872df1a23d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames> Mhairi Aitken (author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>r_5688517856cbd58316</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D8CEBEAC-B33F-43E8-8BC8-06C8F936C84E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Understanding public opposition to wind power as an opportunity, not an obstacle</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Modern energy review</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/55f87e5af27a1eb45cdb71872df1a23d"><gtr:id>55f87e5af27a1eb45cdb71872df1a23d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames> Mhairi Aitken (author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>r_4027131568cb2fbe54</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>32AC680E-862E-4365-87FE-8CBAC35B82F3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Why we still don't understand the social aspects of wind power: A critique of key assumptions within the literature</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Energy Policy</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a43b9454b496afe1419782907bd3f3ad"><gtr:id>a43b9454b496afe1419782907bd3f3ad</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Aitken M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cf90f90454f4c4</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4AFBD972-A4C2-4E53-B1CC-54151028E325</gtr:id><gtr:title>Public participation with science and the challenges of active participants</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Abstract and Session Submissions</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/55f87e5af27a1eb45cdb71872df1a23d"><gtr:id>55f87e5af27a1eb45cdb71872df1a23d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames> Mhairi Aitken (author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>r_8661473883cbd5876c</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/G036527/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3FB490ED-1150-4B72-BB38-E3A211952C34</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Science &amp; Technology Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
