Taking a lead from partners and perspectives within Latin America, this project brings together praxis-focussed artists, activists and academics from Brazil, Mexico and the UK, in a series of exploratory encounters (both face-to-face and virtual) that will investigate methods and processes for this work. Concentrating on understanding work in local community settings the focus of this collaborative investigation will be the ways in which such practitioners work with communal space, and specifically how these spaces become potentised, and how these practitioners can open up spaces with a qualities of what Victor Turner termed 'potency' and transformative potential, or 'potentiality' (1979: 465-6). These encounters of enquiry will enable practical approaches to interrogate, and be interrogated by, theoretical perspectives, brought to the discussion by artists, activists and academics from Latin America and the UK. Our intention is to create conduits for these influences and perspectives, and to enable knowledge exchange on three axes: between community artists and community activists, between academia and non-academic communities of practice, and between perspectives and experience of the global south (Brazil and Mexico) and global north (UK). Participants in the project will seek to co-produce knowledge and practice-based methodologies, informing the praxis of socially-engaged artists and activists, and to inform theoretical understandings of academics in the fields of social theory, activism and applied creative practice. 
Deliberately aiming to disrupt traditional dynamics of North/South knowledge exchange the project will connect artist/activist communities from the Global South with peer communities from the Global North, introducing the fundamental value of building on the strengths from both geographies of creativity and activism, and particularly challenging linguistic exclusion and established dominance by knowledges from the Global North. These modes of engagement will contribute significantly to the CC programme as the literature suggests (Miura and Sawaia, 2013) 'Southern' thinkers are often highly attuned and advanced in their treatment of ideas of connection, disconnection, community and creativity (refs): themes at the core of Connected Communities scholarship.

Our 6 collaborating communities will connect by working together in intensive residential 'encounters' ('encuentros') in Brazil and the UK, using inclusive and non-hierarchical encounter processes that mirror the kinds of developmental workshops at the heart of the study. They will experience and interrogate each others' spatial-affective practices and ideas, from their respective fields of community arts and activism which overlap, but do not necessarily share recognised common languages or identities. The aim through these encounters is for the participating communities to co-create conditions that develop enriched understandings of their own work, that locate meaningful connections and comparisons for future mutual learning, and that inspire and motivate them to develop and continue these connections. The ultimate aim of the project, reaching beyond the lifetime of this award, is to develop an inclusive, interdisciplinary, international, arts/activism 'community (communities) of practice', in which fostering the creative potency and potential of spaces of activity is a key and conscious practice element.

Potential beneficiaries:
-Freelance arts and activist practitioners, initially in the UK, Brazil, Mexico
-Third or public sector community development / community arts organisations in these regions (organisations engaging freelance practitioners; and with a strong continuing professional development ethos) 
-Learning and professional development bodies (through informed input into practitioner training programmes)
-Community participants in future projects (through the greater confidence and effectiveness of arts and activist practitioners)
-Cultural and social policy makers (through informed policy decisions relating to programming and staffing community initiatives)
-Wider academic networks and discourses (through fresh diverse insights).

Where impacts beyond academia and policy will be evident:
-In the professional development offer; and effectiveness of projects and services in supporting locally-led positive change at community level
-In the cultural vitality, 'potency and potential' of local community sites of activity
-In the quality of life, confidence and wellbeing of citizens who participate in future project activity with impacted practitioners.

Impacts from collaboration
Amongst research participants and networks, from cross-sector working , impact will manifest as: 
-A new international, practice/scholarship community of enquiry, focussing on the questions of spatial and affective practices in community arts and activism. 
-The potential burgeoning awareness of, and animation of, a new trans-national 'community of practice'. 
-Deepened awareness of the experience of Global South-North divide in how knowledge is differently valued, and the limiting impact of this on the development of discourses.

Further impacts 
Triggered through the project's exchange activities, first wave impacts will stimulate (anticipated timescale for visibility - within 2-3 years of project start):
-More widely informed, dynamic academic and practitioner discourses within wider peer networks, (seen in conference papers, publication reference lists, CC network enquiry, practitioner forums, project proposals, activity in the field)
-Such new work underpinned by international perspectives and experience of community arts and activism (evidenced by quality and degree of internationally-informed work taking place, and interactivity with wider international peer networks - e.g. 'Hemispheric Institute')
-Benefits for practitioners in forming a new community of practice, including shared creative, facilitative and conceptual approaches, collaborative interrogation of praxis across barriers of discipline, practices, language and culture (seen in stronger practitioner confidence and clarity in articulating their methods, stronger practitioner voice and self advocacy by the sector) 
-Increased international activity and collaboration influencing discourses within the CC Programme
-Flourishing of the community of enquiry.

We expect to see, beyond the project year, new cross-sector publishing, conference and research collaborations, which have their roots in the project. We anticipate that the Global South to North dialogue will result in links across linguistic and contextual divides which would not have occurred without the project, and with the potential to catalyse practitioners' and academics' career trajectories. These links - supported post project through the project blog, to be maintained for at least 5 years - will have inevitable impact on the practices of those involved, and hence on their project participants.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>43995</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Short creative film documenting the narrative of the research encounters forming the main activities in the project.

Working with text, music, visual staging and video, two short performances were created and posted on social media. These were shared on Facebook, WhatsApp and other platforms, and quickly reached an audience of 2,000 across Brazil and the UK. Shares included the former president Lula, and the posts were included on other websites showing citizen action in the political upheavals.
Many comments were made in response, both positive and negative. The creative team was amazed at the speed and power of this stage-1 impact, and this influenced our beliefs in the opportunities for using social media for sharing local and home-created activism.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58cabc33435fa9.80101077</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Brazil, S?o Paulo, Community voice workshop with actors, during follow-on research trip by PI, May 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2AEA6078-5014-4902-ACCD-862BF3287F28</gtr:id><gtr:impact>20 participatory theatre practitioners and some of their family members attended a voice workshop delivered by PI Anni Raw, hosted by project participant/collaborator Kelly Di Bertolli; purpose: to share artivista practices across international and linguistic boundaries.

Collaborations include piloting different approaches to the execution of service delivery (social and health services)

Additional collaborations at community level, which demonstrate the real world application of our action research findings, have begun since the main research activity took place, including between peer third sector arts organisations, arts collectives and individual professional practitioners.

One such collaboration has already led to the new network (currently calling itself 'Potency &amp;amp; Potencial Artivista Collective' )co-bidding for a professional art commission with the Horniman Museum, London. The result of the bid will be announced on 15th March.

Other examples include the initiation and organisation between members of the collective of 3 paid workshop commissions for one of the visiting members, in order to share with UK artivist practitioners, specialist Brazil-based thinking on theatre as a tool for activism.

In the year since completion of this award there have been multi-sector collaborations developing, including developing a follow-on proposal to the AHRC, which sadly was halted due to PI illness, but still with the intention to revisit this. The collaboration involved one community partner from the original project as Co-I, and six arts organisations across UK, Brazil and Mexico as new partner organisations. The findings from our project were considered of significant interest by these non-academic partners and there was a strong interest in sharing and developing the ideas at a local level, as well as connecting to discuss this internationally.

Further paid opportunities to deliver professional development skills for practitioners (community workers and acts practitioners) based on her new understandings (international adaptations, deeper understandings of spatial issues) have been initiated in the UK for one Brazilian project participant (Kelly Di Bertolli), who has also then been invited to co-direct a theatre piece with one UK-based theatre company (Mind the Gap, based in Bradford). 

There is growing interest also from a 'community university' initiative at Durham University to develop further work with Kelly, and while on a visiting scholarship to Durham Kelly is delivering engagement activities and seminars through this initiative.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2017</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>E472546E-79E2-45E7-9D14-8390B553E4CC</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56deb547a12712.13325171</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Our award period is still now complete, however these key findings develop all the time, as the legacy of the project unfolds.

We sought to bring together 6 communities to learn from different perspectives on how creative facilitation and arts participation can create possibilities for change:
Together we created a series of collaborative research encounters, to explore the atmospheres in community (arts/creative) workshops or spaces, and what enables such spaces to carry the possibility of change, or to inspire people to work together for change.
Participating community members were drawn from academic, practitioner and activist communities in Brazil and the UK. The style of the research project was 'action research' so that we explored the question together both through discussion and through trying out different practices while we were together. 

Our headline findings have now begun to distil, and point to the paramount importance of affinity through common values, shared as a language of connection, even where linguistic barriers are severe. We have significant leaning from the project, since it developed through some difficult phases of social and political dynamics, in order to find some further, meaningful responses to the research questions. Ultimately, the ''potency and potential' we sought to understand grew through the experimentation with a range of 'languages' including physical languages/using the body; creative and aesthetic languages allowing non-verbal communication; spatial practices in which affinity was allowed to develop, and in which imagination of future collective action could grow and excite all collaborators.
We distilled a number of important practical and group-facilitative factors in creating an environment that can be 'potent' enough to catalyse collective action or change. These include:
a) Creating a space that is away from everyday distractions;
b) Ensuring the space is comfortable enough to allow people to reflect (which is an activity that is not possible if individuals do not feel they can relax); 
c) ensuring however that also includes new experiences, disorientation, being stretched, and a variety of approaches or engagement styles, including visual creativity, physical movement, sound and music creation, conversations, presentations, walking, playfulness;
d) Building significant levels of mutual trust between those in the space, including by carefully challenging obstacles to trust: This can be achieved indirectly through collaborative creative activity, so that issues can unfold without confrontation and an ensuing loss of trust;
e) Sharing values and passions for the aims of each others' work, and sensing each others' high levels of commitment (as a trust building measure as well as motivating factor);
f) Exploring concrete next steps, and sound communication mechanisms that suit people's needs and habits, in order to allow future collective action to take place (systems we used included a blog and a 'What'sApp' group, and we are now searching for the right further communication platforms).

We also began to realise the tremendous contribution of virtual spaces of connection to our project, as an additional extension of the physical spaces we shared and the spaces of creative imagination in which we found shared future imaginaries, which surmounted other obstacles.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This remains a continuing discussion between project collaborators, as this has been a project in which knowledge is co-produced between all members of the project.
There have been and continue to be follow-on activities and initiatives in which several members of the research project have taken forward aspects of the learning, and collaborative activity is ongoing despite there being no current funding to support this. We anticipate that our embryonic collaborative platform - launching this week a full year after the project completed - will facilitate further dialogues. We already have more collaborators interested in joining the discussion on spaces of potential for activism.
Two key cornerstones of our findings have emerged as particularly important, and these relate to 'affective ties' build on shared values; and the additional extension of our thinking to incorporate virtual and digital spaces in which we can and what to connect. However, without the first of these, that develops through actual (face to face) contact the second is very elusive. Through this knowledge we are conceiving and building new ways to work together, both locally and internationally for democracy and justice (using our enhanced knowledge).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>7E60FC33-F606-4FFD-ABDD-73323DF74B3C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56debbcd09c2a1.18300412</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A9E745EA-EFC1-448E-9561-92DAB97D52FE</gtr:id><gtr:title>&amp;quot;Pot&amp;ecirc;ncia e Potencial&amp;quot; em espa&amp;ccedil;os criativos intersticiais: pr&amp;aacute;ticas espaciais transformadoras entre artistas/ativistas socialmente engajados</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>NAVA: Revista do Programa de P?s-gradua??o em Artes, Cultural e Linguagens, Instituto de Artes e Design :: UFJF, Brasil</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9c2ebd2599bb1ec7a5436ef50ebc5838"><gtr:id>9c2ebd2599bb1ec7a5436ef50ebc5838</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Raw, A E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c833efa46b59.84275943</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B0C53A8A-D3F7-49A3-ABA8-2A145C6042B2</gtr:id><gtr:title>Augusto Boal's
