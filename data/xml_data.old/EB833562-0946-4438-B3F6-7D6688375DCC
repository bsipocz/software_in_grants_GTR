It has over 1,400 members of staff, over 400 research degree students and an annual research income of more than &amp;pound;110 million. The School was named University of the Year in 2016 by Times Higher Education, in recognition of our response to the Ebola epidemic. We have an excellent track record in engaging the public with our research in the global and local communities where our research is conducted. 

Since 2012, a Public Engagement Coordinator has provided support to staff and research degree students at the School to engage with the public. A part-time Public Engagement Officer has provided support in one of the School's three Faculties since 2015. Support provided includes training courses in public engagement, one to one support to incorporate public engagement in research funding applications effectively, opportunities to engage with diverse audiences such as at science festivals, and a Small Grants Scheme that provides up to &amp;pound;1,000 for researchers to plan and deliver public engagement projects. 

Despite considerable growth in the number of School staff and research degree students who engage the public with their research, barriers to such engagement still exist. We want a better understanding of what these barriers are and how we can address them, for example by capitalizing on or strengthening existing support mechanisms or developing new ones that meet the needs of our staff and research degree students.

This project will survey staff and research degree students about 1) their public engagement with research (PER) activity, 2) their awareness, perception and use of existing PER support mechanisms, 3) the barriers they perceive or face in undertaking PER and 4) how they feel that these could be addressed. This will allow us to reflect up our existing successes in embedding PER activity as well as understand how to better support researchers to engage with the public in the future.

Using this information, we will take the School's current public engagement strategy (2012-2017) and update it for the next five years, in line with the School's central strategy. We will also build a practical framework that we can use to continually evaluate our progress against the priorities in the new public engagement strategy. This evaluation framework will allow us to evidence PER activity and the effectiveness of PER support in the future. 

Informed by both the learning acquired through surveying staff and research degree students and the priorities in the new public engagement strategy we will implement new and/or more tailored tools for PER support. We will ensure that these are publicised effectively to staff and research degree students through innovative means. This will include initiating a PER awards scheme for formal recognition of outstanding engagement by staff and research degree students.

By reflecting on our progress to date and planning and implementing new mechanisms of PER support and recognition, this project will allow us to more effectively evidence and celebrate PER activity, measure the impact that formal PER support has had so far and further embed a culture of engaging the public with our research at the School.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We expect that the greatest long-term impact will be realised on the London School of Hygiene &amp;amp; Tropical Medicine itself and staff &amp;amp; research degree (RD) students at the School. As a culture of embedded Public Engagement with Research (PER) continues to grow at the School, we would expect this to have a secondary effect on wider public audiences.

Impact on Staff and RD students: 

This project will increase awareness of PER support, provide greater recognition of outstanding PER activities across the School and deliver enhanced and/or tailored mechanisms of PER support based on a greater understanding of School staff and RD student contexts and needs.

We would therefore predict that this project will lead to an increase in demand for PER support and encourage greater inclusion of PER in research funding applications. This will lead to stronger funding applications that incorporate public engagement and its impacts throughout the research cycle. This project also has the capacity, through increased PER activity across the School, to lead to better quality research that is informed and influenced by public understanding and perspective.

Impact on the School:

The survey, focus groups and interviews that will take place through this project will allow us to better evidence the value of PER support and activity at the School. Through developing an evaluation framework that will be implemented along with the new PE strategy, this project will also allow us to continue to capture these activities and impacts moving forward. Effectively evidencing PER activity will be important for the School's submission to the next Research Excellence Framework (REF). It will help the School to identify and write REF case studies that incorporate PER which has the potential to support a stronger School-wide submission to the next REF.

Impact on the public: 

We anticipate that increased inclusion of PER within research funding applications and enriched PER activity at the School will have a long-term impact on the diverse public audiences we engage with both locally and globally. Specifically it will contribute to increasing public understanding of the research that we do, inspiring people of all ages around the topic of public and global health and empowering diverse individuals to contribute their knowledge and perspectives to the research we do.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>37460</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R01969X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
