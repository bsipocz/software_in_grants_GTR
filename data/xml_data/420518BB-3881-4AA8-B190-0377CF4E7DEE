For example, in the UK, the number of people aged 65 and older is expected to nearly double within the next 40 years from around 10 million people now to 19 million in 2050. Such dramatic demographic changes will have a huge impact on society. The main part of research that is dedicated to ageing concentrates on changes that are related to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease. However, even during healthy ageing changes occur: Cognitive functions related to memory and attention decline, motor functions slow down, and perceptual functions decrease such as in audition or vision. 

The proposed project will investigate age-related changes in visual motion perception in the absence of sensory and optical deficits such as blur, myopia, cataract or glaucoma. Not all problems with vision have to do with the eyes and there is increasing evidence that the visual areas of the brain are also affected by ageing.
Motion perception is an important visual function that helps us to navigate through the environment, recognize other people's facial and body language, and accomplish simple everyday tasks such as pouring a cup of coffee. Therefore, deficits in motion perception can strongly affect older adults lives including their safety, social interactions, mobility and hence, their independence.
Previous research has shown that basic or low-level motion perception, i.e., the motion of basic visual features such as moving dots, is strongly affected by ageing: Older adults have, for example, difficulties discriminating the motion direction of moving dots and are less able to integrate information across space and time. However, older adults can recognize and discriminate high-level visual motion, i.e., the motion of familiar and more relevant stimuli, such as faces or biological motion. Motion for more familiar stimuli can be computed by using the local motion signals of the stimulus or by integrating the global form information across time. With the studies described here, we will be able to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the apparent discrepancy between low- and high-level motion perception in ageing. In a first step, we will investigate the relationship between decreased low-level motion perception and high-level motion perception by correlating performance in tasks related to both kinds of motion. In a second step we will highlight the relative contribution of local motion and global form information to the perception of familiar dynamic stimuli. In a third step, we will ascertain the core brain areas that are involved in processing high-level motion in ageing and how those areas are functionally connected. The proposed research will combine behavioural methods with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The results from the proposed research with ageing lead to a better understanding of motion processing per se. In the long run, the results from these studies can also help to develop new technologies and applications specifically suited to the needs of the ageing population so that they can maintain their quality of life and actively take part in society.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Healthy aging diminishes performance in visual motion perception. Low-level motion perception decreases especially dramatically. The perception of more familiar high-level dynamic stimuli remains relatively intact, although older adults have difficulties integrating local motion and global form as efficiently as younger adults. A potential reason that high-level motion perception is less affected by ageing than low-level motion is that higher-level visual processes compensate for decreased functioning of lower-level visual processes. Plasticity of the functional organization of cognitive and cortical processes occurs throughout life and functional networks that underlie visual perception still undergo reorganization during aging. The goal of the proposed research is to elucidate the perceptual and functional changes underlying visual motion perception in healthy ageing. We will study the relationship between decreased low-level motion perception and high-level motion perception in ageing by correlating performance in low-level visual tasks such as motion detection and direction discrimination with performance in higher-level visual tasks, such as the discrimination of point-light walkers. Further, we will elucidate age-related constraints on high-level motion mechanisms and investigate to what extent local motion and global form information contribute to the perception of high-level visual motion perception. Last, we will explore the underlying neural mechanisms of high-level visual motion processing in ageing and ascertain the brain areas that contribute to high- and low-level motion perception in ageing and their functional connections. The proposed research will combine psychophysical methods and fMRI. In the long run, results from the proposed project will help us to understand the mechanisms underlying motion perception in healthy ageing and lead to a more complete model of the processes underlying visual motion perception in general.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The primary impact of the proposal will be an increased understanding of the processes underlying changes in visual motion perception in healthy ageing. In addition to the scientific community, there are at least three direct and indirect beneficiaries of the proposed research. 
Most importantly, older adults will benefit from the proposed research in the long run. Understanding the changes in visual motion processing related to healthy ageing and broadcasting the results to a more general audience will draw attention towards the special needs of the ageing population and in so doing, increase the effort of industry and companies to develop products geared towards the specific needs of the older people who are not suffering from any major clinical conditions. Given the increasing number of older people in industrialized countries, the ageing population already provides a new upcoming market, which is slowly being developed. In addition, if older adults are actively able to take part in society and maintain their quality of life it will decrease the prevalence of geriatric depression and social isolation which will in turn have a positive impact on the public health system.
Second, the industry concerned with building applications and developing techniques that help older adults to overcome certain deficits will benefit from the results in the long run. For example, the car industry might benefit from some behavioural results of the proposed project to build car interfaces for drivers that take into account the specific needs of the ageing population, or companies that develop household appliances that are designed to help older adults with a variety of everyday tasks.
Third, the United Kingdom will benefit indirectly from the results. The UK is one of the leading countries for fundamental research in visual perception and ageing on both the behavioural side and also when it comes to understanding the underlying neural mechanisms and brain functions. The results from the proposed research will support the reputation of the UK as a center of excellence in these areas.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>221357</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Afernoon tea for older adults</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8FBEBFA0-F237-40B3-A7B7-2A572E5F6D6E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We held an afternoon tea for older participants and older adults who were interested in participating in our studies.

So far, we have published one paper tangentially related to the grant. Two articles have been submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals, and two further articles are in the process of being written up. 

The experiments we conducted within the context of the grant were investigating low- and high-level motion perception in healthy ageing. Low-level motion refers to the detection and discrimination of moving dots, which is primarily processed in early visual areas such as V1 and MT. High-level motion refers to the discrimination of more relevant biological motion such as body or facial movement, which is processed in higher-level visual areas such as FFA and STS. 

Our behavioural experiments support previous findings in that older adults have difficulties to discriminate low-level motion. However, more interestingly, our results also indicate that the decline is selective to certain motion directions and not as general as has been previously assumed. One of our key findings is that controlling for other low-level factors such as speed or motion coherence, healthy ageing mostly affects direction discrimination for directions away from horizontal but not directions away from vertical, which might be related to an adaptation to the visual environment with age. 

Our behavioural experiments also show that changes in high-level motion processing, i.e., discriminating the motion direction of point-light walkers, is unrelated to deficits in low-level motion processing, i.e., discriminating the motion direction of moving dots. These results support previous findings in that older adults are able to compensate for low-level deficits, and indicate that older adults rely more on global form rather than local motion information when discriminating high-level motion. 

With regards to our experiments using functional MRI to investigate changes in the neural mechanisms related to high- and low-level motion perception, our results are the first to show that areas related to low-level motion are more affected by ageing than areas related to high-level motion, which is in accordance with the behavioural findings mentioned above.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>N/A</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C6A26590-8C12-4DC2-AC6A-31370B33DFD3</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5460d7de009385.33436203</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare,Transport,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>422E99F1-79EB-451F-AA6C-218E9E4876A1</gtr:id><gtr:title>Adaptation aftereffects for biological motion</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8a30ba269d20a4d9680e2c81abbab7a2"><gtr:id>8a30ba269d20a4d9680e2c81abbab7a2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Biehl SC</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>54196bdc088ec9.30974395</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B176395A-879B-4747-B396-62F96CF8CAF9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Age-related changes in motion direction discrimination in the horizontal plane</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Vision</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4eb4a7e2cf5babdd4f5aeed8e9849645"><gtr:id>4eb4a7e2cf5babdd4f5aeed8e9849645</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Miller L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56d4606cdae162.92010084</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A7801303-DA8B-4F71-9393-6FFB1FB88CE8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Motion coherence and biological motion perception</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/acd6a18ff27bc2e72ec37edd9dc25a0d"><gtr:id>acd6a18ff27bc2e72ec37edd9dc25a0d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pilz KS</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>54196c09a9a934.76932397</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5F81C600-C46C-4AEA-9BF1-BEE0AA2F4205</gtr:id><gtr:title>Effects of aging on identifying emotions conveyed by point-light walkers.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Psychology and aging</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/408fcfa1a3c6c85d2188b87e9645dc2b"><gtr:id>408fcfa1a3c6c85d2188b87e9645dc2b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Spencer JM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0882-7974</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56d45fcb96a038.16780399</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A72B2E02-7967-4560-91B1-EA59648148D4</gtr:id><gtr:title>Motion coherence and direction discrimination in healthy aging.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of vision</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/acd6a18ff27bc2e72ec37edd9dc25a0d"><gtr:id>acd6a18ff27bc2e72ec37edd9dc25a0d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pilz KS</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1534-7362</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58c010874a0a40.88350754</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E586B3F2-D71D-40A1-AC74-5073ADBF120F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Neural changes related to motion processing in healthy aging.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Neurobiology of aging</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8a30ba269d20a4d9680e2c81abbab7a2"><gtr:id>8a30ba269d20a4d9680e2c81abbab7a2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Biehl SC</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0197-4580</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fcc44444b98.07014819</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/K007173/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
