Natural hazards have been identified by the National Security Review as some of the most significant risks to the UK in terms of economic, social and environmental consequences. Natural hazards are increasingly a concern for humanity, as both the rate and impact of natural disasters are rising because of increased societal vulnerability, caused by trends in climate, population growth, urbanisation and land-use. The over-arching science challenge is to increase our understanding of the nature of threats from natural hazards, to improve our predictions and forecasts of the onset, frequency, magnitude and duration of such events. The knowledge and methodologies developed will allow us to better mitigate the impacts on people and the environment, thereby improving our management of natural hazards. CEH plays a vital role in understanding the nature and threats that natural hazards pose by developing the underpinning science to understand and reduce their damaging impacts, and to support the implementation of mitigation strategies. The prediction of hydro-meteorological, biological and air quality hazards will facilitate the design of management systems and improve societal resilience to extreme events. The hazards include floods and droughts, threats from parasites, pathogens and invasive non-native species and threats from natural air pollution incidents.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>4667676</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>1.1 Meeting CEHs Challenges
The 'Natural Hazards' Science Area will deliver to all three strategic areas but primarily to 'Building Resilience to Environmental Hazards' by improving the understanding of our exposure to the risks from floods and droughts, developing improved flood forecasts from hours to days and weeks ahead, developing a drought monitoring and prediction service and a better understanding of the threats from invasive alien species through improved horizon-scanning.
2 Science Area Objectives
Each Science Area has identified a number of ambitions to achieve by 2019 focused around higher level Objectives:
1. Improving our understanding of the threats to people and the environment from natural hazards.
2. Better predict and forecast the onset, frequency and magnitude of natural hazards.
3. Mitigate the impacts and improve our management of natural hazards
3 Research highlights
3.1 Horizon scanning for non-native species 
Invasive alien species (IAS) are considered one of the greatest threats to biodiversity, particularly through their interactions with other drivers of change. Horizon-scanning, the systematic examination of future potential threats and opportunities, leading to prioritization of IAS threats is seen as an essential component of IAS management. A horizon scanning exercise, led by CEH and involving scientists from more than 20 research institutes and universities, identified 30 high risk species with potential to threaten British biodiversity, including the quagga mussel, sacred ibis, the brush-clawed shore crab, the Asian hornet, and the American water-milfoil. This was published recently in Global Change Biology and has been reported in the Independent, BBC Farming Today and BBC News On-line. Additionally the list of species has been adopted by the Non-Native Species Secretariat to inform GB non-native species surveillance.
3.2 Winter floods of 2013/14 
During the winter of 2013/14, much of the UK experienced repeated intense rainfall events and flooding. CEH scientists attended several SAGE meetings to provide advice and analysis for COBR during winter floods. Specifically the CEH Grid-2-Grid model was used provide a rapid assessment of the hydrological impacts of a range of potential rainfall scenarios from the Met Office.
A key research question is whether the burning of fossil fuels is changing the frequency of extremes, and if so to what extent. CEH, in partnership with the Met Office, Reading University, Exeter University, and Oxford University, assessed the scale of the winter flooding before reviewing a broad range of Earth system drivers affecting UK rainfall to provide a summary document that collated and discussed all possible drivers . Multiple possible UK rainfall drivers were identified -although the precise details of linkages between changing large-scale features of the climate system and UK rainfall intensity are still not fully understood. To determine any general changing flood risk, we argue that accurate modelling needs to capture evolving understanding of UK rainfall interactions with a broad set of factors. Ensembles of such model simulations may be needed to build probability distributions of extremes, and so we need to ensure that all heavy rainfall &amp;quot;return times&amp;quot; are fully sampled. Subsequently CEH have been working with Oxford University to determine the degree to which the rainfall and flooding of the winter 2013/14 can be attributed to climate drivers. Initial results suggest that the risk of experiencing this type of event has been increased due to anthropogenic influences on the climate system (paper in draft).
3.3 G2G surface water flood forecasting trial for the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games
A new surface water flood risk forecasting system has been developed by the Scottish Flood Forecasting Service, working with CEH, Deltares and James Hutton Institute. It provides the UK's first operational grid-based surface water flood risk forecast with a 24-hour lead time. At the heart of the system is CEH's Grid-to-Grid (G2G) hydrological model. The new system now exploits G2G estimates of surface water runoff which can cause in situ flooding when water ponds at the surface. In particular, G2G can take account not only of rainfall intensity, but also the effect of paved surfaces, terrain slope and antecedent wetness conditions on surface runoff generation. A particularly novel aspect of the new system is that the tool goes beyond forecasting the likely location of surface water flooding to embrace information on potential impacts on people, property and transport. 
The system was made operational and trialled for the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games where surface water flooding presented a real threat. The Games were fortunate in that surface water flooding was only a real concern on the final Sunday when cycle road races through the city experienced hazardous surface water ponding. The system successfully identified the hazard, and increased the forecast likelihood of a potential minor impact from low to medium as the event got closer. Following positive feedback, the Glasgow pilot continues and plans to expand coverage are under development.

3.4 The effects of snow in Britain: the historical picture and future projections
CEH were asked to review the historical and potential future effects of snow in Britain, for an update to the Water Climate Change Impacts Report Card (first published in 2013; http://www.nerc.ac.uk/research/partnerships/lwec/products/report-cards/water/). The review covered snowfall and lying snow the influence of snow on river flows (water quantity and quality), and the effect of snow on other factors of socio-economic or environmental importance, including transport services, other services/businesses (e.g. power supplies, health services), and farming and wildlife. It also highlighted some knowledge gaps. Alongside the review, we also used data from the 11-member UKCP09 Regional Climate Model (RCM) ensemble to drive the Grid-to-Grid hydrological model, both with and without a snowmelt modelling component, to investigate the potential impacts of climate change and the effect of snow on flood peaks The analysis indicates large future reductions in the ensemble mean of the number of lying snow days across the country This in turn affects the seasonality of peak river flows in some parts of the country; for northerly regions, annual maximum flows are expected to occur earlier in the (water) year in the future. For more southerly regions the changes are less straightforward, and more likely to be driven by changes in rainfall patterns than snow

3.5 Projecting future changes in flooding using high-resolution climate model data
Data from RCMs are often used to drive hydrological models to investigate the potential impacts of climate change, particularly for flood and droughts. Previously, some form of further downscaling of RCM data (typically on an approximately 25x25km grid) has been required for hydrological modelling, but recently the first decadal-length runs of very high resolution RCMs (with convection-permitting scales of ~1.5km) have been performed, by the NERC Changing Water Cycle project CONVEX, for both current and future time-slices. We have used these data, alongside equivalent 12km resolution data, to investigate the effect of climate model resolution on projections of change in peak river flows under climate change. Results showed clear differences in projected changes in flood peaks, with the 1.5km RCM tending towards larger increases than the 12km RCM, particularly in spring and winter If robust, this could have important consequences for adaptation planning under climate change, but further research is required, particularly given that there are greater biases in baseline flow simulations driven by 1.5km RCM data than 12km RCM data, and that only one short future climate projection has been applied

3.6 Flood event attribution for Winter 2013/14
A number of storms occurred across Southern England in winter 2013/2014, causing severe flooding. We used large ensembles of climate model simulations, produced by Oxford University's weather@home system, to investigate the extent to which these floods could be attributed to climate change. Hydrological modelling for the Thames@Kingston, using an ensemble representing the actual conditions in Winter 13/14, alongside ensembles representing conditions as they could have been had anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases not occurred in the past (natural conditions), we showed that emissions are likely to have increased extreme 30-day-average river flows in the Thames ), and slightly increased daily peak flows. The simulated river flows were then used to investigate the effect on flood damages, by JBA Consulting, who showed a small increase in properties in the Thames catchment potentially at risk of riverine flooding, with a substantial range of uncertainty. The results demonstrated the importance of explicit modelling of impacts, rather than just looking at changes in rainfall. This work was published in Nature Climate Change, and received much publicity.

3.7 Supporting Government policy on floods
CEH played an active role in the Government response to the winter 2015-16 flooding. We were members of the Scientific Advisory Group of the National Flood Resilience Review (NFRR) group, undertaking rapid flood estimation and statistical analyses to address specific questions from COBR (Cabinet Office Briefing Room), politicians and the public. We also undertook national-scale work using the CEH Grid-to-Grid model for the Strategic Management Cell looking to provide longer lead time warnings of flooding. CEH also submitted written evidence to the NFRR and the EFRA Inquiry (http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/environment-food-and-rural-affairs-committee/future-flood-prevention/written/30446.html)
CEH were involved in two and supported a third (Flooding) of four projects commissioned by the Adaptation Sub-Committee of the Committee on Climate Change to provide information for the Second Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA2). These covered projections for UK water availability and developing H++ scenarios of climate change and its impacts . CEH was also a co-author of chapter 5 (People and the Built Environment) of the main CCRA2 Technical report (https://documents.theccc.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/UK-CCRA-2017-Chapter-5-People-and-the-built-environment.pdf)

3.8 FEH
November 2015 saw the launch of CEH's new FEH Web Service which for the first time provides on-line access to the data and rainfall model outputs that lie at the core of the flood frequency estimation procedures presented in the Flood Estimation Handbook (FEH) and its subsequent updates. The Web Service provides hydrological catchment information (descriptors) for more than four million sites across the UK that drain an area of at least 0.5 km2. It also provides rainfall depth-duration-frequency information for the catchments and for selected points derived from the new FEH13 and original FEH99 rainfall models. In addition, a point data extraction tool enables drainage engineers, SuDS practitioners and developers to assess drainage design and development viability more accurately. This improved method incorporates FEH13 rainfall estimates and soil and climate properties at 1km resolution, giving users even more accurate runoff estimates from development plots using the latest version of the ReFH rainfall-runoff design method.

3.9 Modelling the effect of temperature on the seasonal population dynamics of temperate mosquitoes
Mosquito-borne diseases cause substantial mortality and morbidity worldwide. These impacts are widely predicted to increase as temperatures warm and extreme precipitation events become more frequent, since mosquito biology and disease ecology are strongly linked to environmental conditions. However, direct evidence linking environmental change to changes in mosquito-borne disease is rare, and the ecological mechanisms that may underpin such changes are poorly understood. Environmental drivers, such as temperature, can have non-linear, opposing impacts on the demographic rates of different mosquito life cycle stages. As such, model frameworks that can deal with fluctuations in temperature explicitly are required to predict seasonal mosquito abundance, on which the intensity and persistence of disease transmission under different environmental scenarios depends. In this paper we present a novel, temperature-dependent, delay-differential equation model, which incorporates diapause and the differential effects of temperature on the duration and mortality of each life stage and demonstrates the sensitivity of seasonal abundance patterns to inter- and intra-annual changes in temperature. Likely changes in seasonal abundance and exposure to mosquitoes under projected changes in UK temperatures are presented, showing an increase in peak vector abundance with warming that potentially increases the risk of disease outbreaks

3.10 Improving understanding of invasive alien pathogens and impacts on biodiversity
Invasive alien species (IAS) are considered one of the greatest threats to biodiversity, particularly through their interactions with other drivers of change. Of the 100 &amp;quot;world's worst&amp;quot; invasive alien species listed by the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature), 24 species have environmental impacts that are linked to diseases in wildlife. Whilst parasites and pathogens are often key players in invasions, there is surprisingly little known about the biology of alien pathogens and their biodiversity impacts.
Horizon-scanning, the systematic examination of future potential threats and opportunities, is a useful approach for prioritising IAS for action and identification of knowledge gaps. To improve understanding of invasive alien pathogens threatening wildlife within natural and semi-natural systems in Europe, CEH led a horizon scanning workshop using consensus approaches with 38 experts from 13 European countries funded under the COST action &amp;quot;Alien Challenge&amp;quot;. Included were pathologists and ecologists with expertise ranging from conservation biology and invasion ecology, to wildlife epidemiology and disease management. A list of ten key research priorities relating to all aspects of invasion process, from introduction to impact, was identified by consensus and a series of policy recommendations were agreed. There was unanimous acceptance that invasion events by pathogens, and particularly epidemiological events, are very difficult to predict. The development of interdisciplinary capacity, expertise and coordination to identify and manage threats was seen as critical to address knowledge gaps and improve predictive capacity.

3.11 The UK Environmental Predictor
CEH, with the Met Office and NOC have been developing an integrated, high resolution modelling suite for atmosphere, marine, hydrological, land surface and ecosystem modelling to demonstrate a UK coupled environmental prediction system and to accelerate the pull through and integration of national-scale high resolution environmental prediction capabilities to useful science and services. Within this project the JULES model has been modified to more accurately simulate high and low flows for the UK. The model was tested over 13 catchments and compared with a hydrological model (CLASSIC-GB) and to observed river flows. The model formulation of runoff-generation was explored with sensitivity tests and a new parameterisation was developed. 

3.12 Drought -DrIVER
DrIVER is an international, Belmont Forum funded project aiming to enhance drought monitoring and early warning. A number of key outputs have now been produced. 
? The datasets of SPI and SPEI were delivered to provide the foundation of the UK Drought Portal (datasets available with DOIs). These datasets will provide a foundation for UK drought analysis, and improved monitoring and early warning tools for the UK. 
? The first application of the Standardized Streamflow Index (SSI) to the UK including the first major application nationwide comparing SPI and SSI for UK catchments shedding new light on drought propagation in the UK. We also examined suitable statistical distributions for SPI and SSI application- the most extensive systematic testing of this type internationally, and found a novel distribution (the Tweedie distribution) performed best.

A key focus of DrIVER has been linking indicators with observed impacts, in order to validate the efficacy of drought indicators. Much effort was put into improving UK impact data and populating the European Drought Impacts Inventory which initially contained little UK data whereas now it contains more impact entries than any other country With our collaborators in University of Freiburg, we then undertook a first analysis statistically linking drought indicators to impacts for UK and Germany finding important regional and seasonal differences in the most appropriate indicators for detecting drought impacts . The first round of DrIVER stakeholder workshops has also been completed: North Carolina (Dec 2014), UK (March 2015), Adelaide (March 2016). All workshops engaged a wide range of stakeholders, and those providing monitoring and early warning information products. The aim of each event was to explore current practice and future aspirations and offered an opportunity to compare across countries.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>28C6B47B-C514-41BD-A2FD-28E283C07D63</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5460cea9827f97.08397990</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Environment,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Horizon scanning for non-native species:
