Magdalena Harris, PhD from the Centre for Research on Drugs and Health Behaviour/London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, talks about one aspect of the Staying Safe Project, research conducted with people who inject drugs in London. She suggests that much more attention needs to be paid to notions of utility and pleasure when looking at interventions to prevent hepatitis C transmission among people who inject drugs.</gtr:description><gtr:id>F06DDFA2-A1C7-4D17-9583-9DA32B1D933E</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-5615899894.0288099c9e6678</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>The staying safe project</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2012</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Staying safe London findings</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:id>880B6A15-F3CE-4EF7-8B42-8E7E1A3EA766</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Paper presented at University of New South Wales, Public Seminar: &amp;quot;Staying Safe: What can research about people who inject drugs tell us about how to avoid hepatitis C in the long-term?

We found that HCV risk awareness was recent and de-prioritised by the majority of participants. A significant research finding was that many of the protective practices carried out by the participants (such as not using others syringes, injecting at home, taking charge of the drug preparation process, preparedness in regard to drugs, equipment and finances) were motivated not necessarily by harm reduction messages or concerns about HCV acquisition, but by more short term pragmatic concerns. These included: avoiding withdrawal and 'dirty hits', facilitating injecting privacy and pleasure, maintaining social relationships and 'non-user' identities as well as venous access and care. While blood borne virus avoidance was a motivator for some, this was a very small part of a bigger picture of risk facilitation and avoidance. 



Specific findings reported in research outputs include those in relation to: 1) vein care; 2) methadone diversion and 3) beliefs regarding sexual transmission:

1) The facilitation of venous access and care was an initial and enduring rationale for safe injecting practices. Difficult venous access resulted in increased contamination of injecting environments and transitions to femoral injecting. Participants expressed an unmet desire for non-judgmental venous access information and advice [1].

2) Almost all participants received opiate substitution therapy, with the majority reporting self regulation and diversion of methadone. We found that this practice was protective in enabling the management of illicit drug use and protecting against withdrawal, thus reducing situations of injecting risk and associated blood borne virus transmission [2].

3) The majority of participants reported infrequent or no condom use with sexual partners, also 'discriminative' needle and syringe sharing with their primary sexual partner. Of note, is that this practice was frequently rationalised in terms of'risk equivalence' between unprotected sex and injecting sharing practices - incorrect in regard to HCV transmission. An apparent and enduring belief in risk equivalence among the majority of participants was found to perpetuate risk practices, pointing to a need for interventions addressing sexual transmission beliefs. [3]



Our findings highlight the utility of attention to the pragmatic and short term needs of PWID, and the ways in which interventions addressing these can promote the reduction of harm. As elaborated in our outputs [1], behavioural and risk focused interventions can fail to engage PWID who have a present-focused temporal orientation and for whom hepatitis C is not an immediate priority. Recommendation for pragmatic interventions based on our findings and reported in our research outputs include: 

1) Increased workforce capacity building in relation to the provision of non-stigmatizing easily accessible information and advice about venous care and access [1].

2) The adoption of more flexible methadone dosing regimens, such as a relaxation of constraints on take home doses [2].

3) Couple based and female specific interventions addressing sexual transmission beliefs [3].

4) Provision of couple specific equipment, such as differently marked/coloured syringe disposal bins and syringes [3].

1) Policy development through expert testimony to the National Institute for Clinical Excellence in their development of national guidance in relation to HCV testing

3) The use of key messages and findings from peer reviewed publications and presentations informing the development of new training materials in hepatitis C prevention


 The following illustrate potential impacts upon practice: 



1) Our research calls for increased workforce capacity building in relation to the provision of non-stigmatizing easily accessible information and advice about venous care for people who inject drugs. 

2) Our research calls for more flexible methadone dosing regimens, such as a relaxation of constraints on 'take home' doses, and recognises the positive role that methadone diversion can play in the self management of drug use, drug withdrawal, and in turn, viral risk avoidance. 

3) Our findings on 'risk equivalence' in drug and sexual risk perceptions relating to HCV suggests the need for couple based and female specific interventions addressing sexual transmission beliefs, and the provision of couple specific equipment, such as differently marked/coloured syringe disposal bins and syringes.

4) Our analysis on why HCV testing uptake so low calls for peer-driven interventions to facilitate access to HCV testing, and the provision of more flexible phlebotomy services, alongside dried-blood-spot testing as an alternative.

5) Overall, our findings highlight the need for interventions to respond to the immediate and pragmatic needs of people who inject drugs which in turn can have indirect HCV prevention effects.

6) Our use of life history methods in a qualitative prospective design indicates the utility of life history methods for exploring the social and life contexts of health and risk practices so as to prevent an overly 'risk-infused' framing as common in much research to date

7) Our focus on 'positive deviance', that is those that avoid risk or infections in the face of risk, indicates the utility of such approaches for exploring resilience to risk (and not only factors linked to risk acquisition).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B32236C2-E9FF-47D5-9E7E-1C2B97DED062</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-9710490060.70056b2f13c38</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Government/ Democracy and Justice,Culture/ Heritage/ Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BEA20FAC-E934-4550-9CA2-6BB99EDBCB56</gtr:id><gtr:title>Hearing the service-user voice: The advantages of taking the service-user perspective into the design of service delivery.</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ae870eede4c9326c5863c4fc32e75aa2"><gtr:id>ae870eede4c9326c5863c4fc32e75aa2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Magdalena Harris (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>r_3274578211cb561b44</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3F507B2B-FD82-4D6C-AAB1-8D423F9F59DD</gtr:id><gtr:title>Staying safe London : indirect technologies of hepatitis C prevention</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2e43b3b6bf9fab1fe29cac498ec4f8ea"><gtr:id>2e43b3b6bf9fab1fe29cac498ec4f8ea</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Magdalena Harris (Co-author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>r_2030881131cb562350</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6133DFEF-8760-4F92-9544-0E5D785A61AB</gtr:id><gtr:title>Why are rates of hepatitis C testing so low among people who inject drugs in the United Kingdom?
