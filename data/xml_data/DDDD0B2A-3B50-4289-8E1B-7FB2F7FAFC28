This will greatly simplify and facilitate the use of faecal worm egg counts (FEC) in the management of helminth parasites in farming systems (including cattle, sheep, horses and pigs), with clear benefits to animal health, farming efficiency and the environment.

Who will benefit from this research?

Farmers, consumers of animal products, the UK economy, participants in the project and the broader scientific, animal health and farming communities.

How will they benefit?

Economic benefits:
The farmer: reduced anthelmintic treatment costs, reduced production losses to infection, and improved sustainability of anthelmintic efficacy. 

The consumer: lower prices of animal products, greater food security and stability of commodity prices, lower risk of anthelmintic residues in food, more ethical food production from healthy animals with reduced environmental impact.

UK economy: increased farming efficiency and food security and decreased greenhouse gas emissions. 

The consortium, a profitable potential product and increased technical and marketing capacity for future animal health products and services.

Social benefits:
Improved resilience of marginal grazing systems in the UK and internationally, and enhanced health and welfare of grazing livestock.

Environmental benefits:
Reduced and more appropriately targeted anthelmintic use, attentuating adverse effects on the environment, for example through toxic effects on free-living invertebrates and decreased prey abundance for bats and other insectivores. Improved viability of organic farming. Reduction in greenhouse gas emissions due to increased production efficiency.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>265664</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>LiHRA meeting</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0FE427EB-8FB6-4FC8-8873-8644C43EB495</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Basic details of the prototype system (as far as IP protection and NDA allow) were presented to an expert group at the Livestock Helminth Research Alliance (LiHRA) meeting in Crete, Greece, Sept 2016. The group included researchers from several European countries including specialist veterinary practitioners and persons engaged in human helminth control policy (WHO, Gates foundation). As a result of the meeting our SME partner was consulted on adapting their system to human healthcare, specifically monitoring and evluation of mass deworming programmes in developing countries. Moreover, they were invited to join a consortium applying for EU H2020 funding for commercialisation of pen-side diagnostic tests for animal disease.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c7d2463427d8.01835863</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.lihra.eu/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The research has informed technical development of the automated faecal egg counting and decision support system.
