In this fellowship I will address this challenge by combining synthetic biology with tissue engineering. Focusing on cardiac drug testing, I will reprogram stem cells through synthetic biology to automatically self-assemble into small, 0.5-1 mm diameter spherical heart tissue constructs (i.e. micro-hearts). Synthetic biologically engineered micro-hearts satisfy all requirements of an effective cardiac drug testing tool, and are cheaper than currently used methodologies. As an effective and inexpensive drug testing tool it will help reduce the cost of drug development, helping the pharmaceutical industry, an &amp;pound;8.8 billion UK sector, survive and thrive. Cheaper and more effective cardiac drugs will lessen the &amp;pound;11 billion burden of cardiovascular diseases on the NHS, and improve the quality of life of the 7 million people living with these diseases today in the UK.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Society: Patients with cardiac problems, patients in general 
There are an estimated 7 million people living with cardiovascular disease in the UK. The proposed micro-heart technology will enable faster and cheaper drug development (both cardiac and other). A long term impact of this is more new, more effective and cheaper cardiac drugs.

Society: National Health Service 
The healthcare cost of treating cardiovascular diseases is &amp;pound;11 billion each year in the UK. The impact of the micro-heart technology will be a significant reduction of developmental cost associated with cardiac drugs. Cardiac drugs will be cheaper, and therefore the burden on the NHS/patients lower.

Society: Animals in research 
Animals are heavily used in cardiac safety/drug efficacy testing. In 2014 according to Home Office data collection statistics 62,778 basic research experimental procedures were carried out on living animals in the UK in cardiovascular studies. Micro-hearts will provide a cost-effective alternative to animal models, significantly reducing the number of animals in research.

Economy: Pharmaceutical industry, biotechnology SMEs 
The pharmaceutical industry is the UK's top research sector, spending around &amp;pound;8.8 billion on UK research and development. The ever increasing cost of drug development is a major burden for the big biopharmaceuticals, but even more so for the small and medium-size enterprises working in this industry. Reduced drug development cost will help these businesses survive and thrive, creating a more diverse industry.

Economy: Pharmaceutical employees
The pharmaceutical industry employs around 26,000 people in the UK A further 250,000 people work in related industries. Cheaper drug development will permit a greater proportion of this work to be carried out in the UK without re-location to other countries, retaining and creating more jobs.

Knowledge: Tissue engineers 
A completely new approach to engineering tissues. A solution to the challenge of multi-lared and graduated tissue engineering. 

Knowledge: Tissue engineering, synthetic biology and mathematical modelling communities
The fellowship will form a bridge between the synthetic biology and tissue engineering communities. Similar connections will be formed with the mathematical modelling community. With effective communication these will engender new collaborations and grant proposals.

Knowledge: The public
Through the outreach activities I will undertake as part of this fellowship, I will disseminate information to the public on the potential of synthetic biology, from cleaning up toxic waste and producing new types of antibiotics, to cancer treatment, and address their safety concerns regarding genetic modification.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>355703</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>79FF00DE-EF11-403F-AE28-24A98AF98EA7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Electroactive biomaterials: Vehicles for controlled delivery of therapeutic agents for drug delivery and tissue regeneration.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Advanced drug delivery reviews</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/178e1366b7c7b4285851007f7c0920c2"><gtr:id>178e1366b7c7b4285851007f7c0920c2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Tandon B</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0169-409X</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5aa6656b0f0bf0.99850915</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P016898/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>60EBB420-734E-4DB5-B0F2-65A1115A27F8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical synthesis</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DF4CD176-73D5-4039-BBC7-28D33DC364DD</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Synthetic biology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
