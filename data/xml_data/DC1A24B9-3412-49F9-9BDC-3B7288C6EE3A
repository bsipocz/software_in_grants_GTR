In order to synthesise these compounds, chemists use functional groups , either carbon-heteroatom bonds or carbon-carbon double bonds, to make the new chemical bonds that are needed in the chosen target molecule. Conventionally, a carbon-hydrogen bond is an un-functional group , which cannot be used to make new chemical bonds. However, chemists are beginning to use carbon-hydrogen bonds as functional groups by using reactive compounds of transition metals to break C-H bonds in a process called C-H activation. Using a C-H bond as a functional group enables a more direct synthesis that involves fewer synthetic steps. Methods that use catalytic C-H activation, therefore, reduce waste production and energy consumption and offer clear benefits in terms of cutting costs and saving time - vital to both the bulk and fine chemical industries.Despite some outstanding recent advances, C-H activation has yet to find widespread use as a synthetic tool. Indeed, many state-of-the-art C-H activation methods are not commercially viable because they employ a metal catalyst that is too expensive, require harsh reaction conditions or require the addition of a stoichiometric oxidant. Furthermore, strong C-H bonds are difficult to break using current C-H activation technology and the regioselectivity of the reaction (ie. which C-H bond in the molecule reacts) is almost always determined by the structure of the reacting organic molecule, rather than the metal catalyst.In this project, we will investigate an uncommon 1,2-addition mechanism for C-H activation where the C-H bond is broken by adding it across a metal-heteroatom bond. At present there are only a handful of examples of C-H activation that operate via this mechanism, but we plan to verify the potential of this 1,2-addition mechanism for application in catalytic reactions that are attractive in a wide-range of synthetic scenarios, from bulk chemicals to drug candidate molecules. We will take a dual approach to expanding this synthetic landscape, using both early and late transition metals. The 1,2-addition mechanism offers excellent potential for varying the identity and the chemical properties of the metal and the heteroatom involved in the C-H activation reaction. This variety is very attractive for the development of new reactions that are capable of functionalising strong C-H bonds and operate under mild conditions. Moreover, this approach has strong potential to enable catalyst controlled regioselectivity in C-H activation.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The aim of this project is to explore a new mechanism for catalytic C-H activation that will ultimately enable powerful new synthetic methodology. Whereas the conventional approach to organic synthesis relies on functional groups to make new bonds and build molecules, C-H activation uses the ubiquitous C-H bond, an un-functional group , to achieve the same goal. Hence, catalytic C-H activation has the potential to revolutionise chemical synthesis by shortening synthetic routes and reducing waste. Although this project involves fundamental research in organometallic chemistry, the outcomes will potentially benefit all users of synthetic chemistry across a diverse range of fields and industries by reducing waste (ie. sustainable synthesis) and enabling new synthetic strategies. Methods that use catalytic C-H activation offer clear benefits in terms of cutting costs and saving time - vital to both the bulk and fine chemical industries. Catalytic C-H activation also has the potential to improve the efficiency of our use of hydrocarbons. At present, saturated hydrocarbons are separated from crude oil and either burnt as a fuel or converted in high energy processes (cracking) to unsaturated hydrocarbons that can be used as chemical feedstocks. C-H activation offers a more efficient and direct route to these valuable chemical feedstocks. Regarding methane in particular, C-H activation could potentially provide a mid-term answer to the world's energy problems that would bridge the gap between present-day oil dependent technologies and the technologies of the future. Unlike crude oil, many large reserves of natural gas have yet to be exploited. Unfortunately, most of these natural gas reserves are found in remote locations, such as Alaska and Siberia, and transportation of methane from these areas is economically unfeasible. These vast energy sources could be exploited, however, if methane could be efficiently converted to the transportable liquid fuel methanol. Although burning methanol as a fuel does not address the issue of climate change, making full use of the energy sources available to us would ease the transformation to a carbon neutral economy. This approach has been advocated by the Nobel laureate George Olah in his description of the methanol economy . Consequently, the development of an efficient method for the conversion of methane to methanol would benefit the wider public regarding long-term enhancement of the quality of life. So, the chemistry we propose could impact a wide-range of beneficiaries including the pharmaceutical, commodity chemical and energy industries. These appear to be diverse targets, but identifying the industrial settings that will receive most benefit will only be possible as a result of the investigations we plan to undertake. We plan to build links that in the future will lead to collaborative research with companies from the industries we have highlighted. Engagement with these companies will be facilitated by the high significance of the field of C-H activation and the subsequent dissemination of our research in high impact journals and at international conferences.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-07-15</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100345</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>We published the first report of primary amine- or amido-NHC functionalised complexes of Rh and Ir and also reported complexes of Ru, Pd and Pt - in a very well-cited paper.
