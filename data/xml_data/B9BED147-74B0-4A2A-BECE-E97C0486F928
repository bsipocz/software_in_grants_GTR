Through an exhibition of large-scale, high-impact images in the city centre of Edinburgh, it will showcase the ways in which advances in science and technology can ? through cutting-edge imagery techniques ? reveal some of the wonderful sights normally hidden to us. Free, open and accessible, the exhibition will provide a valuable platform for reaching new audiences.
It will form a valuable part of our continued attempts to make science and technology easily accessible to those not necessarily engaged with, or targeted by, most traditional science communication activity. It will showcase some of the vastness, complexity and beauty of science in fields such as biomedical imaging and astronomy. In doing so it will draw attention to the techniques, technologies and research that make it possible to glimpse these otherwise invisible worlds.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-03-24</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-12-25</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>10000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Government of Scotland</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Marine Scotland Directorate</gtr:department><gtr:description>Patterns in Nature</gtr:description><gtr:id>A1C18168-9FFB-4D05-B2C3-B82E788D3974</gtr:id><gtr:impact>95% of visitors felt that it was very important that science photography exhibitions like Patterns in Nature were made accessible to the public.

'Couldn't be better - visually spectacular!'

'It highlights science in a very beautiful way; makes science of our world more appealing than it was at school.'

Renowned architect Charles Jencks discussed his work and explained how science and nature provided sources of inspiration for him. This was followed by a Q&amp;amp;A with the audience. A total of 162 people attended this event in the National Museum of Scotland.

Visitor feedback across the festival was very positive: 96% of audiences were either satisfied or very satisfied with the Festival events they attended. Comments for the exhibition included:

?Couldn?t be better - visually spectacular!?

?It highlights science in a very beautiful way; makes science of our world more appealing than it was at school.?

?I?m a teacher and I?m using this as inspiration for a lesson in my classroom on Patterns in Nature - I?m taking notes and photos so I can use these examples in my class.?

?Attending Edinburgh International Science Festival events has been invaluable in allowing my teenagers to learn more about the opportunities studying and working in science might hold for them. In addition it is broadening my knowledge and interest in current/future science and political issues.?</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>532970453e1094.71654786</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:presentationType>Keynote/Invited Speaker</gtr:presentationType><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.sciencefestival.co.uk</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/J501505/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
