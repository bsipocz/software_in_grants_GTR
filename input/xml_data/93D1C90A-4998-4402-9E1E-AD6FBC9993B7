amyloidosis</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>G0901596</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>For 30 years the MRC has supported my work on a rare disease known as amyloidosis. We have discovered much of what is known about this condition and about a normal protein in the blood, known as serum amyloid P component (SAP), which contributes to the disease. Our MRC funded research on SAP led us to invent a new diagnostic test which has delivered significant improvements in treatment and survival of amyloidosis patients. We went on to establish the UK NHS National Amyloidosis Centre, the world?s leading centre for diagnosis and management of amyloidosis. The survival of our patients is not bettered anywhere else. However amyloidosis, which is responsible for the death of one per thousand of the population, is still an almost universally fatal disease. Alzheimer?s disease and maturity onset diabetes, both of which are associated with amyloid, inflict prolonged suffering on patients and carers, at great cost to society. We have now invented new medicines that specifically target SAP and amyloid, and produce clinical benefit in animal models which closely resemble human disease. Our most advanced drug, that removes SAP from the blood, helpfully slows disease progression in amyloidosis patients but this is not sufficient. We have now developed another novel treatment, using antibodies to SAP, which completely removes the amyloid deposits that cause disease. Our achievements have so impressed GlaxoSmithKline, the second largest pharmaceutical company in the world, that it has agreed to collaborate with us to develop these medications. They have insisted that our university research team shares the early risk in the long, difficult and extremely costly process of drug development. They are therefore deliberately not funding our component of the programme. The present proposal seeks the funding necessary for our contribution, while GSK conduct their own in house development work. This represents extraordinarily good value for the MRC and for the patients who will ultimately benefit from potentially life saving new treatments. Enabled by the laboratory research proposed here, the GSK collaboration will bring our key inventions into clinical trials as soon as possible and, within the 3 year period of the grant, the basic laboratory work, for which we now seek MRC support, will translate towards benefits for sick people.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Systemic amyloidosis is a fatal disease caused by extracellular deposition of autologous proteins as insoluble fibrils coated with the normal plasma protein, serum amyloid P component (SAP). Treatments are urgently needed to promote regression of amyloid deposits. We have demonstrated in mice that depletion of circulating SAP by CPHPC, our novel small molecule drug, followed by injection of anti-SAP antibodies to target residual amyloid-bound SAP, rapidly and safely clears visceral amyloid via an antibody, complement and macrophage dependent mechanism. We have produced efficacious mouse monoclonal anti-SAP antibodies suitable for humanisation, but clinical development and testing will be challenging and costly. In a highly innovative step for big pharma, GlaxoSmithKline have recognised the exceptional opportunity provided by our research and are developing our unprecedented, small molecule plus antibody, combination therapy in a shared risk collaboration. GSK will humanise the anti-SAP antibodies, develop CPHPC for regulatory approval, manufacture GMP products and conduct formulation, pre-clinical pharmacology, toxicology and clinical testing. Their work is absolutely dependent on the research proposed here which, under the shared risk agreement, is not funded by GSK. We will characterise the mouse monoclonals comprehensively in vitro and investigate them in vivo in amyloidotic mice, enabling selection of the optimal humanisation candidate. We will characterise the humanised derivatives and validate efficacy of the eventual anti-SAP product in murine amyloidosis, defining pharmacokinetics, optimal dosing and time course of amyloid clearance. Our results will illuminate the mechanisms of this novel immunotherapy and inform design of the initial clinical studies, scheduled for 2012. We shall also use our extensive panel of amyloid fibrils and GSK?s Domantis domain antibody technology, to produce anti-fibril antibodies for treating amyloid without needing CPHPC. Antibodies cross-reactive with several but not all amyloid fibril types are described but, in a new approach, we will target the universal fibril ligand for SAP to generate genuinely pan anti-fibril antibodies suitable for use in all forms of amyloidosis. We will evaluate the anti-fibril antibodies in parallel with the anti-SAP reagents, validating them as potential candidates for clinical development. There is no a priori reason why anti-SAP should not be as effective in man as it is in mice; the anti-fibril strategy is also very promising. We are extremely fortunate that GSK?s development resources and industry expertise are available. Renewed MRC support for our research will now enable final translation of our MRC-funded discoveries into treatments addressing grave unmet medical need.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>802425</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Cambridge</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>MRC Cognitive Function and Ageing Study (CFAS)</gtr:department><gtr:description>Brain SAP content and cognition in the elderly at death</gtr:description><gtr:id>DB76A626-F9C6-40C9-BC63-3C1F2B220E7C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The study is just starting.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>iL6DCKbiRyR-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The MRC CFAS Tissue Resource is unique and uniquely able to provide the large number of samples required for this study.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Pepys is investigating the role of human serum amyloid P component (SAP) in neurodegeneration and seeks a relationship between the presence, distribution and amount of SAP in different brain regions of elderly individuals whose cognitive status at the time fo death is well established.

They have great expertise in translational studies, comprising eleven studies involving candidate HIV-1 vaccines over the past 10 years (reviewed in ref 38 and unpublished), coupled with high level specialist expertise in measuring and characterizing vaccine-induced T cells. They are providing the unique GMP DNA vaccine for this study.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The goal of the project is to demonstrate that DNA vaccination of normal human volunteers in whom circulating human serum amyloid P component (SAP) has been depleted by the drug, (R)-1-[6-[(R)-2-carboxy-pyrrolidin-1-yl]-6-oxohexanoyl] pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid (CPHPC), induces an enhanced immune response compared to the same vaccination in control subjects with normal circulating SAP values. The vaccine to be used is directed at conserved epitopes of the HIV-1 virus. The objectives are:
1. Demonstrate that the T cell immune response to the three priming doses of DNA vaccine is significantly enhanced in SAP depleted subjects compared to identically vaccinated SAP sufficient control subjects.
2. Demonstrate that the T cell immune response to subsequent boosting by the cognate protein antigen, is significantly enhanced in subjects who were primed by DNA vaccination whilst SAP depleted, compared to identically vaccinated SAP sufficient control subjects.
3. Determine whether the enhanced T cell responses which may be observed after SAP depletion are more potent than the responses in controls in suppressing HIV-1 virus replication in vitro, and thus, (a) support the general concept that SAP depletion can be used to enhance the protective immunity inducible by DNA vaccination in humans, and (b) encourage further vaccination studies against conserved regions of HIV-1 in order to develop an effective protective and potentially
therapeutic vaccine against this pathogen.
The study will also confirm safety and tolerability of 3 courses of 24 h intravenous infusion of CPHPC, to produce maximal depletion of plasma SAP, immediately before intramuscular injection of DNA vaccine.
Prof Sir Mark Pepys developed the drug CPHPC which uniquely depletes circulating SAP to extremely low concentrations and he originated the concept for the present trial. He is the inventor on the key patents covering CPHPC which are owned by his UCL spin out company. Some of the patents are licensed to GSK and they have helpfully provided the drug for the present study.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Medical Research Council (MRC)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>MRC UK Brain Banks Network</gtr:department><gtr:description>SAP in normal human brain</gtr:description><gtr:id>06DE0121-829B-415A-B9AD-AA9A25607306</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The project has just started</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>DqrpA8bwQmL-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The MRC Brain Bank is a unique resource, uniquely able to supply the material required for this study.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Pepys is investigating the role of human serum amyloid P component (SAP) in neurodegeneration and is characterising the presence, distribution and amount of SAP in different brain regions of individuals dying over the whole age range represented in the Brain Bank.

In some aged individuals massive transthyretin amyloid deposition in the heart causes fatal senile cardiac amyloidosis, a condition which is rarely diagnosed but is almost certainly much more prevalent than currently recognised. Most of the &amp;gt;100 rare mutations in the human transthyretin gene increase the amyloidogenicity of the respective variant proteins and cause autosomal dominant adult onset hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis, usually presenting as familial amyloid polyneuropathy. There is currently no effective treatment for this uniformly fatal disease. Since transthyretin amyloidogenesis involves misfolding and dissociation of the native tetrameric structure of the protein, a rational therapeutic approach is the use of small molecule ligands which are specifically bound by transthyretin and stabilise its native structure and assembly. Prof Sir Mark Pepys and his research group are world leaders in the study of transthyretin misfolding and amyloid fibrillogenesis. They contribute both intellectually and practically to the design and evaluation of novel TTR stabilising ligands.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2010-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Imperial College London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Medicine</gtr:department><gtr:description>Histopathology</gtr:description><gtr:id>7E95FFAA-743A-449C-A61E-AE9EA3355FE4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Nothing yet in the public domain.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>cFHWQ56CJBZ-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Expert histopathology review of our unique amyloidosis samples</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Unique world leading collection of amyloidotic liver tissues which are being expertly reviewed by a specialist liver pathologist at Imperial.

tissue damage in systemic amyloidosis which is responsible for disease and death is caused by accumulation of amyloid deposits in the tissues and organs. There are currently no clinical treatments which directly target amyloid deposits for elimination. The Pepys team first identified and validated human serum amyloid P component (SAP) as a therapeutic target in amyloidosis in the mid 1990s. In vitro, SAP both enhances amyloid fibril formation and protects amyloid fibrils from proteolytic degradation by macrophages. In collaboration with Roche they developed the novel palindromic bis-D-proline compound (R)-1-[6-[(R)-2-Carboxy-Pyrrolidin-1-yl]-6-oxo-Hexanoyl]Pyrrolidine-2-Carboxylic acid (CPHPC), which was intended to prevent SAP from binding to amyloid fibrils in vivo and dissociate bound SAP from amyloid deposits (Nature 2002). CPHPC is avidly bound by human SAP in a complex composed of two native pentameric SAP molecules cross linked by 5 bivalent CPHPC molecules. The complex is perceived as abnormal by the liver and instantly cleared, leading to profound depletion of SAP from the circulation which persists for as long as the drug is administered (PNAS 2009). Targeted depletion of a pathogenic protein by a small molecule drug constitutes a potent, novel pharmacological mechanism. The depletion of plasma SAP also clears most of the SAP from amyloid deposits but the affinity of SAP for CPHPC is insufficient to produce complete dissociation of all SAP from amyloid deposits in the face of the continuous production of 50-100 mg of new SAP per day and the avid binding of SAP to amyloid fibrils. CPHPC is well tolerated by patients and has been administered to more than 60 subjects for a total of more than 50 patient years without any adverse effects. But up to about 10% of the amyloid associated SAP remains in major visceral amyloid deposits even after months of continuous CPHPC treatment. Nevertheless we have not observed any new amyloid accumulation in patients on CPHPC, even those in whom there was progressive deposition before and after CPHPC exposure. Furthermore there were encouraging signs of prolonged renal and possibly patient survival in subjects receiving CPHPC. However we have not detected any amyloid regression. Thus while CPHPC may be a useful adjunct to other therapy for amyloidosis it does not itself promote elimination of the deposits. Pentraxin acquired full ownership of CPHPC from Roche in December 2008.
The capacity of CPHPC to clear essentially all SAP from the circulation, while leaving significant amounts of SAP specifically bound in the amyloid deposits, suggested the possibility of using the residual SAP as an amyloid-specific target for antibodies which can invoke physiological clearance of amyloid from the tissues. Depletion of circulating SAP crucially allows such antibodies to be administered safely and effectively. This approach is unrelated to the function of SAP itself and simply uses SAP as a passive amyloid-specific target. It has been remarkably successful in experimental models (Nature 2010) and should be applicable to all forms of amyloidosis although its safety and efficacy, especially for amyloid in different organs and tissues, will have to be, and is being, carefully evaluated. GlaxoSmithKline licensed the invention of this first in class combination of a small molecule drug and a monoclonal antibody from Pentraxin in February 2009. They have already fully humanised one of our optimal mouse monoclonal anti-human SAP antibodies and clinical testing is currently underway. In 2012 they conducted a Phase 1, Open Label, Dose Characteristic Study to Investigate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and tolerability of intravenous and subcutaneous doses of CPHPC in patients with systemic amyloidosis (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01406314?term=amyloid+gsk&amp;amp;rank=4), enabling progression to a single dose first in human study of anti-SAP antibodies co-administered with CPHPC in patients with systemic amyloidosis, which is currently underway http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01777243?term=amyloid+gsk&amp;amp;rank=2.
