This proteolysis must be selective and is achieved by tagging the target protein with a small molecule called ubiquitin. Over 700 genes in our body are involved in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis and misregulation of proteolytic control can lead to cancer, metabolic syndromes, neurodegenerative disease and ageing.

In our laboratory we study one of the key cellular enzymes involved in this ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). This enzyme controls genome DNA duplication and distribution to daughter cells as well as cell growth, differentiation and death. In addition, the APC/C modulates DNA damage repair, brain function and metabolic processes. As such, a better understanding of how the APC/C works in cells is of benefit for human health providing the possibility of discovering potential biomarkers for early diagnosis of disease and valuable information useful for the development of new drugs. 

Although 20 years have passed since its discovery, our understanding of the mechanism and control of the APC/C cellular machinery is lamentably limited. This is partly due to the enormity (more than 13 subunits) and complexity of the enzyme. Moreover, many subunits of the APC/C are chemically modified at multiple sites by the addition of phosphate groups ('phosphorylation') brought about by protein kinases. Very little is known about the regulation of this chemical modification but we have recently discovered a novel mechanism of phosphorylation within APC/C subunits, and we aim to investigate the detailed underlying workings of this mechanism. In particular, we will focus on the largest subunit, Apc1 and uncover how Apc1 phosphorylation is controlled and how this impacts on the function of APC/C in the maintenance of healthy cells. We have already developed a method to reconstitute recombinant APC/C enzyme as well as a system to scrutinise the function of the APC/C using Xenopus egg extracts and fission yeast genetics. Therefore, we feel this programme provides a robust platform for new APC/C research, facilitating the detailed study of phosphorylation-mediated APC/C activation via Apc1 while also giving us the opportunity to apply our findings to possible translational and clinical applications. In order to achieve a maximum outcome, we will study APC/C regulation using a multi-disciplinary approach involving biochemistry, genetics, structural biology and cell biology.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The APC/C is arguably one of the most important ubiquitin ligases in our body as it controls cell division and proliferation by ubiquitylating and degrading a number of key regulatory proteins, ensuring the gnome integrity and stability of the cells. Despite the obvious importance of this enzyme, the molecular mechanisms of APC/C-dependent ubiquitylation and proteolysis are still poorly understood. 

We have recently successfully merged our long-standing unique skills in studying APC/C ubiquitin ligase function in Xenopus egg extracts with the MultiBac recombinant technology from the Barford laboratory. Thus, in this project, using the novel approach, we will focus on phosphorylation-dependent activation mechanism of the APC/C, in particular via Apc1, the largest subunit. The APC/C is phosphorylated at more than 50 sites in mitosis and becomes active, however the underlying the mechanism and the roles of phosphorylation are largely unknown. Intriguingly, we have recently found that the order of phosphorylation, more precisely, phosphorylation relay between Apc3 and Apc1, seems to play a pivotal role in Cdc20 loading and the subsequent activation of the APC/C. Using the MultiBac system, we will reconstitute different apo-APC/C with mutations in Apc1 and determine how the APC/C works at the enzymatic levels in Xenopus egg extracts, in combination with structural analysis. Also, we will study how Apc1 phosphorylation is regulated by mitotic kinases and how the level of phosphorylation converts to a signal to Cdc20 loading at the molecular level. The results obtained in these cell free system will be followed up in vivo using culture cells as well as fission yeast. 

Understanding the regulatory mechanisms of the APC/C is expected to provide key information about cell cycle control, ageing, genome stability and systems biology. The project also has great potential for translational research, such as the screening and development of anti-cancer therapies.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>1 Who will benefit from this research?
- Basic and translational researchers in the fields of cell cycle, proteolysis, growth control, signal transduction, cell survival and cancer science.
- UK and worldwide cancer research centres.
- Pharmaceutical industry, development of anti-proliferative drugs.
The proposed research is basic in nature, and the immediate impacts from this allow increased scientific understanding and advancement in the field. Our work also broadens the range of research within the Institute and Faculty allowing studies involving biochemistry and model organism biology. Furthermore, it has the potential to contribute to the development of new therapies of human diseases caused by dysregulation of &amp;quot;cell division&amp;quot; such as cancer. Mitotic exit is an unexplored area of interest for anti-proliferative cancer therapy with a growing body of evidence indicating that this pathway is a promising target. The APC/C is arguably one of the most important regulators in this step and this programme serves to explore such possibilities. We plan to develop an advanced protein-complex system, which will facilitate a novel approach to drug screening for cancer therapeutics. Once we have a detailed molecular and structural understanding of the APC/C, it will become a 'more realistic' cancer target for pharmaceutical companies as well. Moreover, the activity of the APC/C is important in G1 maintenance, dendrite formation in neurons, memory and metabolic processes as well as meiosis and healthy development of sperms and oocyte. Thus, in the longer term, this research has the potential to impact in several areas of human health and welfare, delivering benefits to all. 

2 How will they benefit from this research?
Basic researchers in related areas will benefit from the mechanistic understanding of how the APC/C, a key ubiquitin ligase works during the cell cycle and how it is controlled using specific subunits and co-activators. Members of more diverse organisations or companies, as listed above, will also be interested in our development of mutant apo-APC/Cs and the functional analysis of the vertebrate APC/C mechanism and regulation, as this will provide a robust platform for new APC/C research, including translational and clinical applications, such as screening for small-molecule inhibitors. Moreover, Cdc20-APC/C interaction is essential for all living organisms including the parasites of tropical diseases (e.g. Plasmodium, Trypanosoma). The technique of reconstitution and dissection of the APC/C system in different organisms has the potential to unlock the problems hampering drug discovery for the treatment of tropical diseases. For example, the diversity of the primary amino acid sequences of Cdc20 and APC/C subunits (e.g. no C-box in Plasmodium Cdc20) will provide an opportunity to identify inhibitors specific for parasites and safe for humans.
