Roots need water, dissolved nutrients and oxygen, and good quality soil can transport all of these. Good soil is important for sustainable agriculture / specifically the production of grass or crops without damage to the soil or surrounding environment. The structure of soil can be damaged by compaction caused by tractor wheels or tillage. Also, if nitrate-containing soil becomes waterlogged, it exudes nitrous oxide (laughing gas). Nitrous oxide is a potent greenhouse gas causing global warming, and also adds to the destruction of the stratospheric ozone layer. If a soil is resilient, then even if it does become compacted or water-logged, it can recover. The aim of this project is to learn more about the structure and processes within soil, so that we can promote soil quality and resilience, and minimise emission of nitrous oxide. We intend to use four new, or newly improved, experimental methods, based at different research centres across the UK. These are X-ray computed tomography (similar to the CAT-scans used in hospitals), a device for measuring the water-holding ability of soil when it is being drained by gravity only, an apparatus capable of monitoring the nitrous oxide emitted from twelve laboratory samples, and a 'lysimeter' which measures the precise way nitrate is distributed and leashes through the soil under simulated rainfall. Soil is a very complicated material, and up until now studies have mostly correlated their properties without completely understanding them. To move beyond that, we enlist the help of a computer model called 'Pore-Cor' which simulates the porous structure of soil. We intend to make the model even more advanced by introducing arrays of closely packed smaller pores within the larger structure, as occur in real soil. Not only does the computer program correlate all the different properties, it also displays its results in a Virtual Reality environment / so we can climb inside the soil and see what is going on. The model will allow us to understand the geometric arrangements of the smaller pores relative to the larger, the pore environments in which the nitrous oxide is generated and vented, how nitrate distributes through the soil to feed the nitrous oxide-inducing bacteria, and how compaction and saturation affect the processes occurring. The model will also drive the experimentation forward because of its need for accurate data, and enable predictions to be made for nitrous oxide emission under other conditions and in varying soil systems. The emission of nitrous oxide is affected by other factors which will not be measured or modelled, for example temperature and wind speed. It also varies according to soil management / in particular the amount of fertiliser added, tillage, and the grazing or cropping regime. However, underlying all these effects are the fundamental structures and processes, and better understanding and prediction of these will help inform policy on land management to achieve optimum soil quality and resilience, and minimum nitrous oxide emission.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>This project will promote the improve the understanding and predictability of soil quality and resilience, and assist with the minimisation of nitrous oxide (N2O) production. Grassland and arable soils with similar clay contents, but variable organic carbon content and age of ley, will be studied at 7 cm core and 50 cm precision lysimeter scale. The samples will be studied at typical ambient density, or after fast or slow compaction. A hierarchical approach will be taken to the properties of the samples, ranging from void structure through quasi-static and dynamic fluid properties, to structure-mediated chemical and biological processes. The void structure of the soil samples will be measured by X-ray computed tomography, and water retention curves will be measured with the help of a novel gravity drainage cell. The dispersion and breakthrough of conservative (bromide) tracer and nitrate will be measured using a new precision lysimeter and rainfall simulator. Nitrous oxide emissions will be measured under conditions which are structure mediated but neither carbon- nor nitrogen-limited. Dominance of denitrification over nitrification will be checked by measurement of isotope and isotopomer ratios. The results will be interpreted by a new multi-scale pore model of soil structure. Two hypothetical structures of soil will be generated, with micropores which act hydrologically parallel to macro-pores, or which act in series with the macropores. Inputs to the model will be the macro-pore size distribution from X-ray CT scans, and the full range water retention curves. Outputs will be conservative tracer breakthrough characteristics, nitrate dispersion characteristics, and rate of N2O production. We aim to obtain outputs sufficiently aligned with experiment that they can not only explain the properties of the sample set, but also predict the properties of other soils and conditions, thus allowing the fundamental advances to inform policy on land management.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>240962</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Ten outreach activities already submitted as jes-818069 BBSRC SPQR final report</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FE47415F-D5EE-42F8-9BFA-EE44503E3DC6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>1.

New models of terrestrial nitrous oxide production and saturated hydraulic conductivity. A dual porous version of the Pore-Cor network simulator has been developed, which precisely matches a wide range of physical and porous characteristics. It includes full transport calculations of species involved in nitrous oxide production. It quantitatively matches the production of nitrous oxide, dinitrogen and carbon dioxide, and gives unique information as to the spatial relationship between biological hotspots, in which nitrous oxide production occurs via Michaelis Menten kinetics, and critical macro-porous flow pathways. The model has also been used to examine the effects of consolidation on pore structure and associated changes in saturated hydraulic conductivity. Continuum scale simulation codes have also been developed to model transient denitrification in spherical aggregates, and one-dimensional soil profiles. 
2. A new function for the water release characteristic of deformable soil. We have derived a new function to predict the soil saturation state as a function of matric potential and porosity which takes into account the effect of deformation and soil damage. Previously, soil damage by compaction or shear deformation could not be taken into account in models which predict the soil water-release characteristic from time-invariant soil properties (e.g. sand, silt and clay content, bulk density and organic carbon content). While it is known that soil damage affects the water release characteristic, there was no mechanism to predict the likely changes. Our new model fills this gap. We also used a separate model of the soil water-release characteristic as the sum of two functions: one describing release from the large inter-aggregate pores and one describing release from smaller pores, to describe the effects of consolidation. The model confirmed the preferential and significant impact of consolidation on the larger macropores. 
3. A new approach to predicting soil hydraulic properties. We have shown how the use of conventional analytical approaches to predict relative hydraulic conductivity in drying soils can be erroneous, due to shrinkage and the saturation of clay soils at low matric potentials as low as -85 kPa. We offer an alternative approach to predicting relative hydraulic conductivity, based on a simple model accounting for uniform shrinkage of the soil pore space. This suggests that conductivity is little affected by shrinkage in the tension-saturated range. 
4. New X-ray CT scanning results and protocols. X-ray CT scanning protocols and segmentation methods were developed to generate 3-D gray-scale data-sets for arable and grassland soil samples. Methodology was created for extracting network of macro-pores from binary data, determining their sizes and for calculating pore size distribution. Structural damage on inter-aggregate porosity was detected on compression. 
5. New measurements of gaseous fluxes from soil cores in a modified apparatus. The novel helium atmosphere gas flow-through system for examining the effects of controls on the denitrification process was modified to allow amendments to and measurements from soil cores with well-defined structural characteristics prepared at Rothamsted Research. Nitrogen, nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide flux data were generated with high temporal resolution from soil cores under controlled laboratory conditions. 
6. Soil wettability measurements with new data analysis. We have also developed an improved method of measuring soil wettability at the core scale, incorporating a new method of data analysis. 
7. Tracer transport at half metre scale with lateral spread We have used our half-metre scale lysimeter to measure the transport of nitrate and bromide tracers through pairs of packed and unconsolidated soil samples. The apparatus is unique in being able to give lateral as well as vertical dispersion measurements.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This work has laid the foundations for important advances in soil science, in all the areas listed above.
