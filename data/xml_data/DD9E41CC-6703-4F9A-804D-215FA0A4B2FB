The rationale of UK dispersal policy, implemented by the 1999 Immigration and Asylum Act, was to ?spread the burden? of housing asylum seekers across the UK and discourage long-term settlement in the South East. The impact of a policy regime that determines the geography of refugees? movements upon long term integration has been largely neglected. This research will explore how onward migration after dispersal can provide insights into refugee integration by examining the structural and individual agency factors that influence migration decisions.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;The key research objectives are:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>1. To map the geography of onward migration amongst dispersed refugees across the UK.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>2. To explore the main factors that influence individuals and/or households to migrate (or not) and how this impacts upon the process of refugee integration.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>3. To consider the policy implications for different levels of governance, service providers and the voluntary sector, in terms of the impact of UK dispersal upon refugee migration and integration.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project will address these questions through quantitative data analysis and in-depth interviews with refugees across the UK.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>153331</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>An update on the project: 'Moving on?

At each meeting there were around 20 participants including representatives from local and central government, service providers, local police, voluntary organisations and key academics. Attendees stressed the importance of the research findings which fill a significant knowledge gap in documenting and understanding refugee onward migration. Several participants also noted that they planned to use the findings, and the maps produced in particular, for external lobbying and upcoming presentations within their respective organisations. 

The most significant challenge to achieving further impact following the initial dissemination events has been the PI's maternity leave for one year (and redundancy in 2015). The RA associated with the project has also returned to the US, following the contract end. These factors led to a slight delay in finalising the report, subsequent dissemination and potential impacts associated with the project.

Building upon the initial dissemination events, the final report, executive summary and associated policy briefings were published in December 2015. The final report and executive summary have been distributed extensively across the UK (May/June 2016) both in hard copy and electronically. The research findings are freely available online, both on the project website and Facebook page. A hard copy of the report has been sent to around 50 key academics working on refugee and migration issues, including research teams currently funded by the ESRC Urgency Grants Mechanism on the 'migration crisis'. Research findings have also been distributed to non-governmental organisations and voluntary organisations, some of whom were directly involved in the research project. Furthermore, policy makers and service providers across the UK have been sent copies of the report, executive summary and relevant policy briefings to inform their work. Government offices in the UK, Scottish and Welsh Parliaments including education, health, employment and communities and local government have been informed of the project and the relevant findings. Regional Strategic Migration Partnerships across the UK have also been contacted about the project and it is hoped that the research findings will inform the current Syrian resettlement programme. The Scottish Refugee Council have suggested that the report findings be discussed with the 'New Scots' Refugee Integration Core Group with a view to requesting that members share the report findings with their implementation groups and networks. It is hoped this wide but targeted dissemination will help increase the effectiveness of public services and policy in relation to refugee settlement and integration in the UK. 

The project research findings have been useful for lobbying key policy makers. For example, data extracts from the project were used by the Welsh Refugee Council when providing evidence to the Welsh Government Housing Grant Review (February 2014). Interview material was used to provide evidence in relation to refugee dispersal policy and the prevention of homelessness. The project was also referenced in the response to the Scottish Parliament Consultation on New Tenancy for the Private Sector. A response submitted by the Scottish Refugee Council in December 2014 made direct reference to the project findings (see: http://www.gov.scot/Resource/0046/00468411.pdf, p6-7). Finally, the project findings were also briefly referred to when Professor Alison Phipps and Sarah Craig, Co-Convenors of Glasgow Refugee Asylum and Migration Network (GRAMNet), were providing evidence to the Scottish Parliament on the Scottish Government's proposals for an independent Scotland (May 2014). 

Dissemination of the findings to increase awareness of the project and findings have included a presentation at the GRAMNet Research Day (June 2014) and several conference presentations in the UK and elsewhere. These have included three international conferences (June 2013, August 2013 and April 2014) and one held in the UK (June 2014). The research has been publicised on LinkedIn, Academia.edu and on Facebook (71 page likes). An academic journal paper is currently being revised for re-submission to Population, Space and Place. A short article was published in The Geographer (Winter 2015-2016) and a blog has been written for publication on the Scottish Refugee Council's website. A record of the project report and findings has been deposited with COSLA's Strategic Migration Partnership in Scotland, to be recorded on their Migration Database. The interview data has also been deposited with the UK Data Service, with a short case study published on their website about the project (https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/news-and-events/newsitem/?id=4498). The data has already been accessed by researchers at the University of Edinburgh for use in further study (2016).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>5767E556-2185-4375-AB8C-EF4AC0FAFB54</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5583e9cc7cefb0.89663207</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>First, this mixed methods research project has generated significant new knowledge in the field of refugee and migration studies. The project has developed understanding of how the experience of dispersal influences refugees' onward migration decisions and integration outcomes in the UK. We have found evidence that UK dispersal policy has diversified the ethnic composition of UK cities over time, with evidence of growing numbers of refugees staying in the areas where they were dispersed. Nevertheless, refugees who are dispersed as asylum seekers still have higher levels of onward migration than other new refugees. Multiple factors influence refugees' decisions to stay or move on from dispersal locations including co-ethnic and local communities, employment, education, life course, housing, place of dispersal, racism and health; with variations evident between different nationality groups. Refugee onward migration can positively affect integration, but it is also caused by homelessness or insecure, temporary housing and lack of employment or job training which can lead to instability and poor integration outcomes. Overall, refugees may onward migrate or decide to stay after being dispersed, but neither of the two options can be regarded as always being the best for integration. 

Second, the research findings provided the basis to explore the policy implications for different levels of government, service providers and the voluntary sector, in terms of the long-term impact of UK dispersal policy upon refugee onward migration and integration. This has involved writing an executive summary (with key recommendation) and six themed policy briefings on the topics of employment, education, health, housing, community organisations and discrimination and racism.

Third, the project has led to increased research capacity for the Principal Investigator and the project Research Associate. The PI undertook several external courses on advanced statistical methods (logistic regression), while both the PI and RA developed qualitative skills (NVivo). These skills were primarily utilised for the project research but will undoubtedly assist the PI and RA in future ventures by generating increased research capability. Finally, the PI undertook several courses to develop leadership skills including managing research projects.

Fourth, the project has facilitated the development of new networks which span academic and non-academic specialists. This was primarily facilitated by the Advisory Group meetings but further enhanced through Feedback events in the four research cities. This includes organisations such as Scottish Refugee Council, Maryhill Integration Network and Glasgow Refugee, Asylum and Migration Network - GRAMNet (Glasgow), Refugee Action and Rainbow Haven (Manchester), Refugee Council and Southwark Day Centre for Asylum Seekers (London) and Welsh Refugee Council (Cardiff). A number of individuals in each city also assisted with recruitment and interpretation. These networks will be crucial for the dissemination of the project findings including the final report and executive summary, academic journal articles and policy briefings.

Finally, it should be noted that we were unable to access Refugee Integration and Employment (RIES) data for Cardiff. This was due to the data being in an inaccessible format. The RIES data was analysed for Glasgow, London and Manchester. Additionally, we employed Home Office Survey of New Refugees (SNR) data for the project, which was not originally part of the funding application.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The research findings will enhance academic knowledge concerning refugee onward migration and integration primarily through the publication of quality articles in academic journals. Two journal articles are currently being revised for re-submission. These findings will provide base knowledge and the impetus for further research.

In the coming months there will be a targeted mail shot to key academics in the field of refugee and migration studies as well as non-academic audiences. This will include distribution of the full report and executive summary. Furthermore, six themed policy briefings will be employed to specifically target policy makers, service providers and voluntary organisations in relevant areas such as employment, housing and health. The final report and each policy briefing have a list of recommendations for different levels of government, service providers and local authorities. It is hoped that recommendations will be taken forward in relation to the operation of UK dispersal policy, to reconsider how refugees are supported immediately after being granted status and to extend the current 28 days in the 'move on' period, to develop clear guidance in relation to the 'local connection' housing rule, to review the provision of local refugee integration services in dispersal sites across the UK and to promote multi-agency partnerships to tackle racism.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>7B1A8FFB-B003-49A2-81BD-DBF91098DE45</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5583e96ed9b142.28193924</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.onwardmigration.com</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Evidence given to Welsh Government Housing Grant Review</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B0644421-56E3-412D-AC30-32ADF1198769</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>575ff7dcd68911.76422456</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>SRC Consultation on Private Tenancy</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2E9E0500-1C31-4B88-B419-54A79A54A996</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dda900182309.23133603</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.gov.scot/Resource/0046/00468411.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The dataset deposited with the UK Data Service includes the transcripts of 83 in-depth interviews that were conducted with refugees across the UK: Glasgow, Cardiff, Manchester and London.
