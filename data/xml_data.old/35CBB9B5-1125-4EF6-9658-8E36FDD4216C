In part this is because of institutional weaknesses at national and district level but the behaviour of global actors in the response has also attracted criticism. The situation has been particularly acute in Sierra Leone as many progressive reforms such as Free Health Care and other governance initiatives may have been undermined by the epidemic and the nature of the response.

To date, the evidence on the impact of international Ebola-response assistance in Sierra Leone, and the way it has enabled or hampered local responses, is almost non-existent. For example, it is not known how, why and in what ways local health systems were used, or not used; and it is not at all clear whether international assistance has strengthened local health systems, or weakened them by building parallel structures and bypassing local institutions and relationships. The longer term implications of this kind of assistance, especially beyond the immediate crisis, are thus unclear. 

Documenting and understanding how and why national and international endeavours to care for the sick and interrupt the transmission of Ebola struggled to produce expected results, is paramount for improving future responses and ensuring health systems are not weakened by future emergencies.

Our study will explore a range of factors including: the extent to which responses were informed by local concerns and perceptions of emergency-response systems; whether external interventions sought to work within or with local systems (and whether this resulted in the building of parallel response structures); whether external interventions ultimately weakened and made the health system less resilient by, for example, taking locally qualified staff away from public sector systems or by diverting resources from other ongoing health requirements (including routine maternal and child health and common preventable diseases).

Specifically, we ask the following research questions:

In what ways has the international Ebola-response affected Sierra Leone's health system and its ability to withstand future shocks? 

How can international, national and local emergency response mechanisms be utilised to build a resilient health system in Sierra Leone, and what lessons emerge?

We bring together several different disciplinary and thematic perspectives, including health systems/systems strengthening, policy and implementation science; disaster risk reduction/emergency preparedness; and the anthropology of global health and medical humanitarianism. Explicitly bringing together these often separate bodies of learning will enable us to more fully and effectively answer our principal research questions, identify transferable lessons and contribute to generating substantive health systems research evidence relating to what promotes resilient health systems. 

Specific benefits of the project will include:
* Identification of characteristics of resilient health systems that need to underpin health systems strengthening efforts, in Sierra Leone and other similar settings, and how these can be incorporated in national health systems development. 
* Identifying the key issues influencing village level responses to Ebola and reflecting on the implications of these issues for understanding and building more resilient health systems. 
* Suggestions for revising the existing guidelines for emergency responses, including those of the WHO drawing on the experiences of the recent Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The response to the Ebola epidemic has challenged the dominant paradigm of gradual health systems strengthening, led by national governments and supported by international actors. It poses difficult questions about what kind of responses are helpful in situations when sudden shocks appear to overwhelm already fragile health systems and deplete limited resources. Over the last 12 months, the Ebola epidemic has revealed a lack of resilience in the health systems of affected countries, demonstrating an inability to recover from shocks and mount effective responses.

We ask: In what ways has the international Ebola-response affected Sierra Leone's health system and its ability to withstand future shocks? How can international, national and local emergency response mechanisms be utilised to build a resilient health system in Sierra Leone, and what lessons emerge? Our findings will offer the potential to promote a major shift in the global health systems debate, from one narrowly focused on health system strengthening, to a focus on building health systems that are strong as well as resilient. The study will explore what needs to happen at each systems level, what capacities need to be created at local, district and national level, and what role international actors should play. 

To address these questions, we bring together a multidisciplinary team with extensive expertise in a range of highly relevant, but currently largely separate, bodies of scientific scholarship: health systems/health systems strengthening; policy and implementation science; disaster risk reduction/emergency preparedness; and the anthropology of global health and medical humanitarianism. Explicitly bringing together these often separate bodies of learning will enable us to more fully and effectively answer our principal research questions, identify transferable lessons and contribute to generating substantive health systems research evidence relating to what promotes resilient health systems.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project offers potential for achieving significant impact on international debate thus creating momentum for change among institutions seeking to build strong and resilient health systems. Making a difference will involve conducting rigorous research, generating policy-relevant evidence but also engaging with a diverse group of stakeholders on an ongoing basis, and catalysing advocacy efforts. Beneficiaries and potential impacts are described here. Strategies to achieve this are described in our Pathways to Impact document.

Academic beneficiaries are described in a separate section, but include global and national research communities working on health systems. 
For this group, our findings will offer the potential to further the understanding of what to look for in research on resilient health systems and what frameworks or theories are useful in linking emergency-response and building resilient health systems - which have currently been largely separate areas of scholarship. Our research also has the potential to showcase the benefits of truly multidisciplinary research, as well as enable lesson learning on how best to make this a reality. These benefits will be achievable relatively early in the project. 

A wide range of other beneficiaries will be engaged and reached to facilitate change in policy and practice at different levels of emergency-response and health systems strengthening (described in Pathways to Impact) in the years following the project. 

These include:

Decision makers: 
Ministry of Health in Sierra Leone and other Ebola-affected countries. We will invite key figures in Sierra Leone to join our local Advisory Committee. Through their active engagement (and pre-existing links with our local partners) our project has the potential to inform future emergency-response strategies and the building of resilient health systems - this may include information for decision making on the coordination and management of foreign aid during emergencies. We would also expect to contribute significantly to improving the effectiveness and sustainability of public health services - the profile of medium to long term health outcomes and the success of responses to any future Ebola epidemic would be the ultimate (long-term) test of this.
District officials, chiefs and other local decision makers will also be included in our Advisory Committee and invited to participate in discussion and dissemination meetings that will be held after our Annual partner meetings in Sierra Leone.

International donors, NGOs and development agencies: our results will have the potential to inform and influence the actions of international health actors involved in emergency assistance enabling them to implement more nuanced responses that strengthen rather than destabilise system building efforts already in place and promote resilience drawing on a wide range of resources including existing community capacity. A critical goal of emergency-response to such disasters is to avoid setting back a country's post-emergency health systems development by years. The timeframe for benefits to be achieved ranges from near to long term.
As with local decision makers, international stakeholders will be invited to discussion and dissemination meetings to be held in Sierra Leone throughout the project (see the timeline in the Case for Support for details). We will also consider inviting representatives (e.g. from MSF and/or SCF; DFID) to sit on our Advisory Committee.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>502785</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Stakeholder engagement meetings</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>74D4FB8D-E64B-4B78-82A1-652F4C3142A4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Meetings with key stakeholders at study sites to sensitise them to the project, get their support and initial views on the research. they will later be invited to larger stakeholder meetings.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ca977b5ed069.26549073</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>TV and radio interviews in Sierra Leone</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>20344D08-209F-4622-A1FC-24E234E6F948</gtr:id><gtr:impact>National TV, newspaper and radio journalists were invited to attend the training workshop run as part of the capacity building of this project at the invitation of Njala University.
