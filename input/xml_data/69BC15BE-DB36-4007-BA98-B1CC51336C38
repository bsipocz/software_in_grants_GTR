quality DNA that could be performed in the field. Existing techniques either require
significant expertise and manpower, large automation systems or are simply too time
consuming to be performed in a ?while you wait' situation. The ability to perform low cost and
rapid DNA extractions out of the laboratory environment would be of great benefit in markets
such as forensics, human medicine and pen side animal testing. The core technology could
also be incorporated into
larger laboratory based systems to further broaden the market for the technology.
The core technology being explored in the proposal would be suitable for incorporation into a
wide range of other instrumentation as well as being able to be marketed as either a stand
alone laboratory system or field based and handheld unit.
Currently there is only a single system available in the marketplace that incorporates this step
and it is considerably more time consuming and expensive than the approach being
considered in this proposal.It isd also not portable so would miss a key niche:the Point of
Care(POC) one.
The key benefit in the marketplace would be the time taken for extraction and the minimal
number of steps required. Traditional approaches requiring multiple steps and additional
reagents or equipment such as magnetic beads and centrifuges. The proposed proof of concept
is to rapidly lyse the cells containing the DNA by optimised ?Ultra-rapid?freeze thawing
cycles in a suitable buffer medium. This would reduce the time taken to extract the DNA to
less than 5 minutes.
This could then be incorporated into downstream processes provided by many other
companies, hence bringing in licensing revenue, but also combined with BioGene's rapid PCR
technology and therefore making a UK built portable DNA testing system that is low
cost,'world's fastest' and portable..all unique user benefits.
Whilst the POC market is a key one,the low cost of ownership and compact size would allow
penetration of the lab market.
BioGene manufacture their own instrumentation and have a dedicated team of scientists and
engineers and as as a result are well placed to realise the aims of thee project within the
proscribed timescales.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>57900</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">710055</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
