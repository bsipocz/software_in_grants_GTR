The conference allowed us to communicate our findings and engage with the practitioner community in an extensive and systematic way. The conference brought the academic, business and policy making communities together in joint pursuit of responses to the question of profiting from service innovation. The roster of contributors outside academia included experts from industry (ARM Ltd, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of England and Wales (ICAEW), Google TV, McKinsey) and public agencies (UK Intellectual Property Office, US Patent &amp;amp; Trademark Office, European Patent Office). The event was widely advertised by the websites of the universities of Bath and Manchester, the UK~IRC and the ESRC. It was very well attended (40 participants) and we had a waiting list. Participants came from a wide spectrum of organisations, including Rolls Royce, Accenture, Thomson Reuters, OCS Group UK, Pragmatica Consulting. The panel session involving the Chief Economists of the UK, European and US Patent Offices triggered a very interesting debate about similarities and differences across different IP regimes and the future of business method patenting. Overall the verbal and written (only a handful of questionnaire were returned unfortunately) feedback that we received was &amp;quot;excellent&amp;quot;.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Technical University of Munich</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>How much value is in business model reconfiguration?</gtr:description><gtr:id>8540C586-17BC-4453-ABBA-16C63A7B5D40</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Conference paper: How much value is in business model reconfiguration?
Abstract: This study explores the link between business model reconfiguration (BMR) by incumbent firms and organizational performance. We investigate this relation using regression analysis and unique survey data from a sample of 206 publicly-traded UK and US service firms. Although, across all our sample firms, BMR is not associated with superior performance, an inverted U-shaped relation is estimated between the scope of BMR and firm performance for firms which are also engaged in process/product innovation. These results contribute to the innovation and business model literatures by offering support to the view that innovative incumbents need to adopt BMR that is broad enough to maintain coherence among business model constituent elements, but not so broad to avoid the escalation of conjectured organizational costs.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56deb3df73df33.50626664-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Joint research work</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>As part of a funded collaboration initiative between Bath University and TUM, my Bath colleague Professor Ammon Salter and I work jointly with TUM-based professor Oliver Alexy on a project using the dataset that has been created thanks to the ESRC-funded project.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Bath</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Research Associate at the Centre for Research on Entrepreneurship and Innovation (CREI) of the University of Bath</gtr:description><gtr:id>BC11AB82-905B-46B9-92B3-27474CB40AB2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>One of the members of the centre with contributions to the organisation of research events, funding research etc.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c92ec8a0c2d0.61637116-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>One of the members of the centre with contributions to the organisation of research events, funding research etc.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>One of the members of the centre with contributions to the organisation of research events, funding research etc.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Strategic Management Society Meeting, Berlin, Germany 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>31A19922-2180-44B8-B243-C28CFAC985DC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation on &amp;quot;How much value is in business model reconfiguration?&amp;quot; at the Strategic Management Society Meeting, Berlin, Germany</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56df01ff1995c8.78007035</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Academy of Management Conference, Philadelphia, USA, August 2014</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EE060562-C4C1-4FC1-B264-FA8E4C159340</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presented on &amp;quot;Strategy and IP management in Knowledge-intensive Service Firms&amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56defe71b0eda1.19789208</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>MSc Teaching on &quot;Profiting from Innovation&quot; at the University of Bath School of Management</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7A0E3A6E-5B20-48FF-8A4D-30365306BC7D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Incorporated published work and findings from the ESRC-funded project in the MSc course unit syllabus.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c92749bfce53.91488132</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talk at the European Patent Office (EPO) on &quot;Protecting Intellectual Property in Business Model Innovation: Strategies for Innovating Incumbents and New Entrants&quot;</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4C9F7BE4-C440-478A-BEF0-EE30945552B7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Gave a talk on &amp;quot;Protecting Intellectual Property in Business Model Innovation: Strategies for Innovating Incumbents and New Entrants&amp;quot; at a conference on Intellectual Property which was organized by/at the European Patent Office in Munich.

in the global economy, the blurring of the boundaries between services and manufacturing, and

the move towards the servitization of manufacturing. The aim of this symposium is to throw new

light on the so_called &amp;quot;peculiarities of services&amp;quot; that set them apart from manufacturing, such as

the intangible nature of their product and the simultaneity of production and consumption, by

focusing on the innovation process in knowledge_intensive services. The four symposium papers

explore service innovation topics ranging from the tension between standardisationspecialisation

in services, the influences of knowledge types on the innovation_related behaviours

of KIBS firms, their orientation towards open innovation, to the challenges of capturing value

from innovation. Our objective is to contribute towards developing a deeper understanding of

the linkages between innovation incentives, R&amp;amp;D inputs, R&amp;amp;D outputs and profit in knowledgeintensive

services.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-306622525.96264942aa808b2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Bath-TUM Workshop, Munich</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E0917A36-4348-4EBD-97DF-81019E6F47AB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The workshop took place on September 14-15, 2015, at TUM Business School.

What relevance do different forms of Intellectual Property (IP) and knowledge capture have here - formal methods (e.g. patents, trademarks and copyrights), contractual agreements (e.g. confidentiality agreements and employment contracts) and informal methods (e.g. secrecy and lead time advantages)? The first conference session will explore if and how the so-called &amp;quot;peculiarities&amp;quot; of services affect the ways in which firms use formal, contractual and strategic means to protect and capture value from their IP. The session will explore how features of the industry, firm and innovation bear on the selection of methods for capturing value from innovation. Particular emphasis will be devoted to the question of how far these choices are related to KIBS firms' general competitive strategies, and their approaches to knowledge management. The second session will be concerned with the extent and types of &amp;quot;open innovation&amp;quot; in services firms. How can we understand the various forms and configurations of collaborative relationships with suppliers, customers, competitors, universities, consultants or research labs during the innovation process? What are the challenges faced by each of these partners - for example, in finding the right balance between knowledge sharing and co-creation, on the one hand, and protecting their core knowledge assets and competencies, on the other? The last conference session aims to identify and discuss differences in IP regimes in different jurisdictions, including the United States, which take a more favourable stance to the legal protection of IP (especially in relation to business method and software patenting) than others, such as in Europe. What are the implications of IP regime differences for competitive strategy?

Summary of the article:&amp;quot;There is a growing consensus that the adoption of open innovation business models by firms contributes to
their innovation output and potentially their performance. However, as firms are becoming increasingly open and collaborate with horizontal and vertical partners, they are facing the challenges of protecting their intellectual property and of capturing value from innovation. Studies
have examined how formal and strategic appropriability mechanisms (e.g. patents, trademarks, design rights, secrecy, lead time advantages, complementary assets) influence the extent to which firms capture value from their innovation.
New research from Dr Panos Desyllas and colleagues delves further into this area, considering how the availability and use of different combinations of appropriability mechanisms are related to firms&amp;acute; collaboration activity, especially with different partners
and at different stages of the innovation process. In focussing on how this applies to knowledge-intensive business services (KIBS) firms, their research has produced fresh insight&amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56deb7a3327b62.54877488</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>UK~IRC Podcast - Presentations by speakers at &quot;Profiting from Service Innovation&quot; Conference</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8A9BC15E-3023-4FF3-A1EF-0CCD095B6706</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A summary of several presentations at the &amp;quot;Profiting from Service Innovation&amp;quot; Conference</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-8316676400.8967922b2f9552</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Strategic Management Society Meeting Presentation: Strategy, Organization and IP Management in Knowledge Intensive Service Firms</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>992185C5-D09C-425A-B240-511235E793A5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation at the Strategic Management Society Meeting, Miami, USA</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-7781719283.9288332aa88f62</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Output 1: &amp;quot;The role of competitive strategy in capturing value from innovation in knowledge-intensive service firms&amp;quot;, P. Desyllas, M. Miozzo, I. Miles and H. Lee. 

This study builds on the strategy literature on competitive advantage and a problem-solving perspective of value creation and capture to understand how firms' approaches to capturing value from innovation are interrelated with their broader competitive strategy. Comparing and contrasting IP management between cost- and differentiation-focused firms, we find that cost-focused firms perceive jointly all value appropriability mechanisms as being relatively more effective means of capturing value from innovation, compared with differentiation-focused firms. We also find that cost-focused firms perceive formal appropriability mechanisms as being relatively more effective means of capturing value from innovation relative to non-formal appropriability mechanisms, compared with differentiation-focused firms. Importantly, the relation between strategy and IP management holds even after controlling for previous explanations of IP protection choices on the basis of innovation- and industry-level factors. These results contribute to the literatures on value creation and capture by showing how IP management and the competitive strategy of firms are interrelated.

Output 2: &amp;quot;Innovation collaboration and appropriability by
knowledge-intensive business services firms&amp;quot;, M. Miozzo, P. Desyllas, H. Lee, I. Miles.

We uncover a &amp;quot;paradox of formal appropriability mechanisms&amp;quot; in the case of knowledge-intensive business services (KIBS) firms. Despite evidence that KIBS firms do not typically consider formal appropriability mechanisms, such as patents, to be central mechanisms for capturing value from innovation, we show that they are nevertheless important for their innovation collaboration. We find a significant positive association between the importance of innovation collaboration and the importance of formal appropriability mechanisms. We interrogate the evidence for clients, as they are the most important partners for innovation collaboration. We find that the importance of innovation collaboration with clients goes hand-in-hand with the importance of formal appropriability mechanisms, although a negative relation appears when firms assign very high importance to formal appropriability mechanisms. Thus, modest levels of emphasis on formal appropriability mechanisms may prevent conflicts over ownership of jointly developed knowledge assets and knowledge leakages, while also avoiding the possibly negative effects of overly strict controls by legal departments on innovation collaboration. As well as exploring formal appropriability mechanisms, we also investigate the relationship between contractual and strategic appropriability mechanisms and innovation collaboration for KIBS firms.

Output 3: How much value is in business model reconfiguration? P. Desyllas, A. Salter, O. Alexy

This study contributes to research on business model innovation by exploring the links between business model reconfiguration (BMR) by incumbent firms and organizational performance. We conceptualize BMR as concurrent adjustments of multiple business model constituent elements, such as a firm's resources and competences, internal organization, relation to external stakeholders, and the nature of its value proposition (e.g. Gerasymenko 2015, Demil and Lecocq 2010). Our results suggest that the scope of BMR has important implications for incumbent firms' ability to improve performance after reconfiguring their business models. Although on average BMR is not associated with superior performance, we find that an inverted U-shaped association between the scope of BMR and firm performance holds for firms which are also engaged in process/product innovation. This result emphasises the benefits of modest BMR and suggest that, even though BMR should be carried out in a way that preserves coherence among the various business model constituent elements after BMR takes place, BMR can also have organizational cost implications that must be considered. Our results are also consistent with the view that there are complementarities between product/process innovation and BMR. These complementarities may reflect some superior innovation capacity of firms engaged in BMR to sense and seize new opportunities and deploy the requisite complementary assets. To the extent that new business models are directly linked to new products or processes, these more tangible forms of innovation may offer greater legitimacy and sense of direction among internal and external stakeholders. We also find that the introduction of radically new products/processes strengthens further the moderating role of product/process innovation, suggesting that there is a greater value creation potential waiting to be unlocked by BMR.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings have implications regarding the development of a deeper understanding of innovation in services. The so-called &amp;quot;peculiarities of services&amp;quot; that set them apart from manufacturing, such as the intangible nature of their product, simultaneity of production and consumption, heterogeneity of outputs and importance of organizational factors in firm performance may even extend to the ways of appropriating the benefits of innovation. Some KIBS firms play central roles in innovation processes throughout the economy, as sources of innovations, agents of transfer and diffusion of knowledge, or innovation support for other sectors. Our results pave the way for a better understanding of both inter-organisational collaboration for innovation and the role of the functioning of the intellectual property rights system for KIBS firms.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C856A84E-DDCE-47C7-88DD-A69E25D28D36</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-5296012391.611945b2f36e90</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.bath.ac.uk/management/faculty/panos-desyllas.html</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Innovation Caucus Member (Innovate UK &amp;amp; ESRC)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C70F0859-E584-40BD-A33D-595242A82904</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c920ff0c6fa5.26955126</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://innovationcaucus.co.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>We have developed an original survey sample of a maximum of 255 product and process innovations introduced by 167 publicly-traded British and American KIBS firms.

In addition, our study explores the perceived effectiveness of the full range of appropriability mechanisms, including formal appropriability methods (patents, trademarks, copyrights, design rights), contractual agreements used as behaviour enforcement mechanisms (employment contracts and confidentiality agreements), and strategic appropriability methods (secrecy, lead-time advantages, complexity, complementary assets).
