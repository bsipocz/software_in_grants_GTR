ITS promise to relieve driver from tedious tasks, improve driving efficiency and safety and reduce traffic jams, injuries and gas emissions. 

In ITS, seamless communications between vehicles are required and vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) will emerge to support autonomous driving. In VANETs, vehicle-to-vehicle (V-V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V-I) communications take place via wireless devices called on-board units (OBUs). OBUs are designated to operate under the 5.9 GHz dedicated short range communication (DSRC) standardized technology. Antenna systems, as part of OBUs, are responsible for transmitting and receiving the electromagnetic wave which carries the useful information message. Antenna systems are electromagnetic designs which are connected to specialized RF circuitry. In turn, such circuitry processes the information message before the transmission and after the reception by the antennas. The complete system includes the wireless vehicular environment (or vehicular channel) in which the electromagnetic wave propagates along the way from the transmitting to the receiving antenna. Such environment is inherently very complex and rapidly time varying due to its physical propagation mechanisms including three-dimensional (3-D) scattering, obstructed line-of-sight (LOS) and fast mobility of transmitter, receiver and surrounding objects (e.g., mobility of other vehicles). 

Multi-antenna systems include many antennas operating together in order to increase communication performance in complex wireless environments. Accordingly, compact multi-antenna designs that perform optimally and can be packed in the limited OBU space become of paramount importance to support vehicular communications. Such designs should take into account a series of factors as imposed by the RF circuit, in which the antenna is connected and the surrounding wireless vehicular environment, in which the information message is transmitted and received. We have to exploit every potential the vehicular channel offers in order to maximize performance. The termination RF circuit characteristics affect performance as well and have to be taken into account and compensated at the early design stage. The proposed research activity will incorporate both the characteristics of the vehicular channel and termination RF circuit to derive optimal compact multi-antenna systems for OBUs. Thus, complete &amp;quot;RF circuit/printed multi-antenna/vehicular channel&amp;quot; optimized end-to-end systems will arise. Optimization will take place by maximizing the bandwidth efficiency first, as a standard key performance indicator (KPI). Optimization adopting the energy efficiency KPI will then follow. Such KPI will be employed for the first time to evaluate performance of realistic compact multi-antenna systems. 

The description of concepts of operation (CONOPs) and KPIs with respect to the particular features of vehicular environments constitutes the first step. The adoption of a generic vehicular channel model, adaptable to any wireless environment and frequency of operation, will enable the design of optimized DSRC-5.9 GHz and mm-wave-60 GHz multi-antenna systems. Assessing the feasibility of using mm-wave frequency bands for vehicular communications will be one more achievement of the proposed research activity. The last step will be proof-of-concept demonstrators for both DSRC and mm-wave optimal multi-antenna systems.
While the objective here is to present optimal &amp;quot;RF circuit/printed multi-antenna/vehicular channel&amp;quot; end-to-end systems for vehicular communications, this project could benefit the development of future 5G mm-wave and massive MIMO systems.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This proposal will create new knowledge and opportunities in the area of vehicular communications, which will directly affect the transportation sector. Research challenges to be addressed will offer significant benefits to a number of national priorities and sectors including smart cities and telecommunications. New disruptive communication technologies will be developed incorporating energy efficiency features, with the proposed solutions to be characterized by robustness and high performance. Project outcomes are expected to transform connected vehicles into a stand-alone ecosystem relying on modern Internet of Things (IoT) technologies and making them intelligent entities and adaptable to users' needs. 

The proposed research activity is also very relevant to the cellular communications sector as the adopted modeling approach can be readily applicable in massive MIMO and mm-wave systems for 5G and beyond communications. There exist opportunities to contribute to the development of new 5G standards, particularly on energy consumption of wireless devices. Energy efficient communications is a domain that attracts strong interest of mobile network operators and mobile phone manufacturers. The research team will work together with affiliated industry partners and stakeholders to deliver those benefits targeting on the wider advancement of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and 5G communications. 

This proposal contributes directly to ITS targets of improving driving efficiency, road safety and reducing injuries. Positive impacts across environmental, economic and social aspects are anticipated. Enabling the development of ITS with fully autonomous vehicles, will benefit the general public by preventing car accidents and saving peoples' lives. Less car accidents also imply less expenditure for NHS treatments of injured people. More efficient driving implies less gas emissions, protecting environment and improving peoples' wellbeing. Car insurance companies will reduce the cost for young drivers if the risk of accidents is reduced accordingly. Policy makers will gain general knowledge into the capabilities of proposed technologies helping them to develop regulatory frameworks. 

Brilliant early stage researchers and young scientists or engineers will be attracted to work on project's milestones. A research team with complementary skills on wireless channel characterization, antenna and RF hardware design and communication systems engineering will be formulated. The new team members are expected to become global leaders in designing optimized and particularly energy efficient communication systems. A significant number of undergraduate and MSc students will be supervised by the PI and PDRA. Young generations of scientists and engineers will gain valuable experience and motivation to continue working on project's research areas.

A series of game-changing research outcomes including advanced mathematical models and configurable engineering designs will be produced. Thus, UK is expected to develop a strengthened profile in the project's areas of research, including: a) wireless channel characterization, b) antenna and RF hardware design, c) systems engineering and optimization. The multi-clustered stochastic modeling approach adopted in this proposal will derive channel models adaptable to any wireless propagation scenario. The development of a performance evaluation methodology that will consider wireless channel features, antenna radiation patterns and RF circuit characteristics as independent factors, will enable to derive optimal joint designs. Particularly, the energy efficiency criterion will be applied for the first time in compact multi-antenna systems design.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>252923</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R041660/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
