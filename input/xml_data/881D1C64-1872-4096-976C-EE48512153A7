This is normally because the abstract was not required at the time of proposal submission, but may be because it included sensitive information such as personal details.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The work is based on Agrobacterium-mediated introduction of genes to plantain by a novel technique of apical meristem transformation. This avoids slow regeneration of plants from single cells that may result in unwanted somaclonal variation. The approach has been developed by the co- applicant within Africa. Initial work will use constructs providing expression of a maize cysteine proteinase inhibitor already present in the food of Africans. It prevents nematodes from utilising their dietary protein without harmful effect on humans and controls a wide range of plant nematodes including those that damage plantain. Toxicological studies establish a margin of exposure is greater than 2000 fold when root specific promoters are used to deliver a cystatin. UK field trials have established no substantial adverse effect either on invertebrate associates of a potato crop above ground or on soil communities. The cysteine proteinase inhibitor will be stacked with a non-lethal, synthetic peptide that limits root invasion by nematodes. The work will also adapt other research for BBSRC that is expressing a double stranded RNA in plants. This results in the silencing of a gene that the nematode requires to survive or develop in plants. This effect was first reported in detail for a nematode and resulted in the award of the Nobel Prize for Medicine for the advance it provides. In the context of the current work, the lack of new protein expression in plants overcomes the concerns of expression of even biosafe, novel plant proteins in biotech crops. The levels of resistance required to prevent nematode mediated growth suppression of plantain that lead to yield loss will be determined. This and other information will be collated and permission sought for field trials in Uganda. All the objectives of the work combine to enhance the capacity for Uganda to develop biotech crops in country to meets its national needs and objectives.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-06-16</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-04-17</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>30532</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>This supplementary award was to provide training of African scientists to use the outputs of BB/F004001/1. To avoid duplication details are given in the entry for that main grant.

Post-award presentations in Uganda on 19/09/2013 developed aspects of GM biosafety. The meeting for scientists and farmers was covered by the press in Uganda. 
At a second meeting on 2/09/2014 presentations were delivered on a) Biotechnology and Pest Resistance Breeding and b) Biotechnology product development and commercialization process. This led to an interview of the team by Ugandan Television in a news bulletin.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>39F71A3C-22BB-460B-83DE-5D58038585B0</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56e1509dd76f31.58311593</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This was a supplement to the main grant entitled &amp;quot;Nematode resistant plantain for African subsistence growers&amp;quot; (BB/F004001/1).

It was evident from the project that there is a considerable need for such capacity building activities based around knowledge of what can be achieved with facilities available in home labs. Training has been expanded to include other scientists in the Ugandan National Agricultural Research Laboratories. This training was funded by the USA mission in Uganda. Much of it has been delivered by the PD on the main grant (BB/F004001/1).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4C712B44-11A9-4CF2-9678-D5E339274F42</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e14aa52959e1.25537048</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Biotechnology and Pest Resistance Breeding</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Africa</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1DD9E669-6D7B-405D-A1DE-096C29EC92A7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This seminar on 2/09/2014 to Biosafety regulators, researchers and other stakeholders in Africa on the uptake of GM crops with resistance to pests particularly nematodes.
