Composites</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/I033513/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The EPSRC Innovative Manufacturing Centre in Composites will conduct a programme of fundamental manufacturing research comprising two research themes aimed at developing efficient, high rate, low cost and sustainable manufacturing processes coupled to effective and validated design and process modelling tools. These processes will aim to deliver high yield, high performance and high quality components and structures. The themes are as follows:Theme 1: Composites Processing ScienceThe focus for this theme is to develop integrated modelling systems for predicting and minimising process induced defects and defining and optimising process capability. Topics include: Multi-scale process modelling framework for candidate processes (fibre deposition, resin infusion, consolidation and cure); Stochastic simulation of process and resulting material/structure variability, leading to prediction of process induced defects at the macro, meso and micro scales; Analysis of design/ manufacturing/ cost interactions, enabling process capability mapping, design and process optimisationTheme 2: Composites Processing TechnologyThe focus for this theme will be experimental investigation of next-generation, high rate processing technologies as essential elements within a flexible composites manufacturing cell with multi-process capability. Topics include: Development of rapid deposition technologies: automated robotic control for tow/tape placement, development of flexible/ hybrid systems, application to dry fibre and thermoplastic composites manufacture; High speed preforming processes: fibre placement, Discontinuous Carbon Fibre Preforming (DCFP), multiaxial and 3D textiles and their automated integration into multi-architecture, multi-functional composites; High rate &amp;amp; controlled thermal processing: rapid heating/curing and innovative tooling; Process and parts integration with novel joining technologies, tolerance reduction and on-line inspection In addition to the main research themes, the platform element within the Centre will support four generic research projects operating across the Centre to develop common technologies and underpin the main research priorities. These technology areas are: Multi-scale modelling; Cost modelling; Automation/robotics; and, Design and manufacturing quality integration.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>There are several beneficiaries outside the academic teams involved. The industrial partners supporting the Centre and, in particular, the National Composites Centre (NCC) and its members will benefit directly from the research outputs through close interaction at project level and by representation on the management and advisory boards. The Centre will offer the forward thinking necessary to deliver the research element of manufacturing within the national composites strategy and will feed results into the NCC providing a rapid route to exploitation. All member companies of the NCC and others will therefore benefit from the Centre research. In addition, the wider composites manufacturing community will benefit by attending seminars and innovation conferences organised by the Centre and engaging with the research forum run by the Centre. There is a strong focus on ensuring cross-sector involvement including aerospace, automotive, marine and power generation. The manufacturing advances resulting from the research will be both generic and process specific ensuring benefits across a broad range of sectors and potential for significant growth. Rapid, low cost manufacturing of composites will promote this growth of applications. Many of these applications will offer opportunities for weight saving leading to, for example, significant improvements in performance and fuel consumption in transport, offering major benefits to society. The Centre seeks to make a major contribution to the UK composites manufacturing industry by providing greater understanding of the manufacturing process and novel process technology developments. This will greatly enhance efficiency and quality and therefore open up many more applications of these materials. This in turn will contribute to the GDP of the UK in this rapidly expanding area. The UK and international academic community will benefit from the high quality research output generated by the collaboration between four of the leading composites manufacturing research groups in the country. All academic partners have an excellent track record of publication in high impact factor journals, ensuring rapid take up of our ideas and standing within the international academic community. The Centre will provide a training programme for its community of researchers culminating in the formation of a Composites Manufacturing Graduate School. This will act as a focus for training a new generation of graduate engineers with the necessary skills to pursue a career in the composites manufacturing industry and will enhance the UK skills base in this vitally important area.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>5866583</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Nottingham</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>KP01 - Novel Approaches to the Manufacture of Complex Geometires from Broadgoods</gtr:description><gtr:id>C78209EB-B5F9-45D0-802C-C0B7A7E5A272</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b9642184b9642198-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>Develop novel approaches to the manufacture of composite parts through an understanding of reinforcement manipulation, and the development of appropriate low-cost automation methods</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Luxfer Gas Cylinders</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>KP01 - Novel Approaches to the Manufacture of Complex Geometires from Broadgoods</gtr:description><gtr:id>5998673C-5BE4-4B1B-95EE-2F033098E64E</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b964051eb9640532-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>Develop novel approaches to the manufacture of composite parts through an understanding of reinforcement manipulation, and the development of appropriate low-cost automation methods</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>GKN</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>KP01 - Novel Approaches to the Manufacture of Complex Geometires from Broadgoods</gtr:description><gtr:id>90184690-F1F4-4BF5-8883-E9EAD93DF25C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b9640ab4b9640ac8-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>Develop novel approaches to the manufacture of composite parts through an understanding of reinforcement manipulation, and the development of appropriate low-cost automation methods</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Manchester</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>PP03 - Innovative Multi-material and Multi-architecture Preforms</gtr:description><gtr:id>50EAD410-97BB-44B1-9E0B-F8AED23CF3A2</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b9642aeeb9642b02-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>Composites with multi-functionary (sensing, actuation, heating, deicinng, radar stealth etc) requires innovation in manufacturing at several scales.

The fifth and final year of our operation has seen the completion of all six projects and further funding for the new EPSRC Future Composites Manufacturing Hub - launch date 4th May 2017.

Defect Generation Mechanisms in Thick &amp;amp; Variable Thickness Composite Parts -
Understanding, Predicting and Mitigation:

The DefGen project produced new numerical simulation capability for prediction of fibre path defects. Several cases, based on industrial examples, were modelled to show that it is capable of predicting wrinkles for real world geometry and applications. The most significant of these was a severely tapered panel that was able to accurately capture the formation mechanism of the wrinkle and its location. As follow on to bring the model closer to industrial use, two main follow-on projects have been set up. 

The first is an EPSRC funded impact acceleration award, with LMAT, to transfer the code in to the ANSYS finite element solver, which is used by that company (as opposed to Abaqus that was used for development in DefGen). This will allow LMAT to actively use it in their consultancy work for major UK aerospace companies, providing more accurate simulations and reducing costs. 

The second project is a Rolls-Royce supported EngD in the CIMComp IDC. This has been set up to trial the application of the DefGen tools to a Rolls-Royce specific component and to identify what further developments might be necessary for use at this scale. 

The third follow on project (ATI funded BAM) will make use of simulation tools for the modelling of textile processing, that have been developed in the DefGen PhD project on this topic. They will be extended from the 2D fabrics to more complex 3D woven prefomrs and geometry. 

Related to this is an iCASE award from Jaguar Land Rover, which will make use of predicted geometry for Non-Crimp Fabrics for modelling of mechanical performance. This has allowed new engagement with the automotive sector, which was not part of the original DefGen consortium.

Benefits to partners: Improved product processing for reduced defect rates
Benefits to UK &amp;amp; Society: Reduced scrap (environmental benefit), lower cost composite components


Novel Approaches to the Manufacture of Complex Geometry:
The understandings and technology embedded in the findings from this project have been used in a variety of ways. For example:

? The work on laminators tools (dibbers) has been taken up by a number of companies manufacturing composites structures, with hundreds of dibbers being distributed, and repeat orders from one of the largest companies in composites manufacture in the UK
? The work carried out in understanding manual lay-up processes is driving research in terms of Design for Manufacture in composites, and informing on the use of digital tools for augmented working
? These works, along with an associated project, are making a major contribution in the area of skills &amp;amp; training; making a strong contribution in working towards reducing the level of skills shortages in the composites industry and supporting the SME sector, and in supporting the training of new staff through the NCC
? The demonstration of a route to robotic automation of the lay-up of complex geometry composites has the potential to have both an immediate impact on manufacture and also through on-line videos help to encourage the take up of STEM subjects, and has been very positively commented on by a major UK engineering company.

Ultimately the growing understanding of Design for Manufacture in composites, and the development of tools to support DfM, are likely to have the greatest long-term impact; from the perspective of supporting industry and ongoing research interests. This DfM understanding will enable multi-disciplinary and global collaborations to take place, with the UK positioned as the leader in the field.


Economic and societal impact 

? Inclusive of the notable achievements and partner benefits through transfer of knowledge and technology (as well as testing for push: pull requirements); several activities have (gripping and drape for example) or are being (Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality works for example) aligned to support future needs in skills and training of composites manufacturing in the UK
? Several researchers and staff on the project actively support the National Composites Centre's skills and training activity. For example, repositories of knowledge are being developed and transferred onto web-based tools, and academic learning is being developed into short multiple-choice question and answer quizzes. These activities will be made available to the NCC for skills and training access and continually updated
? Research in relation to the dibber tool and the development of tooling that enables knowledge capture also aims to enhance skills and training capability as well as improve understanding in design and manufacturing
? Expanding collaboration into other institutions will enable the UK to foster global economic performance and competitiveness, by acting as a hub for cutting-edge manufacturing technology, while expanding the range of works achieved at a relatively low cost burden
? The Dibber tool has been purchased in some volume by several manufacturing organisations, for use in their facilities and activities.
 
A significant volume of works are being exploited through knowledge transfer to activities, and by aligning the research to skills and training, the staff aim to ensure there is no capability gap that would need to be plugged at a later date.


Structural Joints using Novel Embedded Inserts 
The project's findings comprising design and manufacturing understanding have been used in a variety of ways. For example:
? Design and manufacture of attachment fittings for a medium volume, lightweight car body floor structure. These have been built into the project demonstrator for a &amp;pound;7M AMSCI collaborative project Light weighting Excellence, a full carbon fibre composite platform for a medium volume car in conjunction with Nissan UK and Bentley Motors.
? A KTP was launched in July 2016 with the project partner bigHead fasteners to translate the project-developed technology into new types of composite attachment fittings for volume manufacture using the CIMComp project findings. 
? The project results are also being utilised with the CIMComp project team involvement in a BAE SYSTEMS led Innovate UK project, HITEA for fighter aircraft primary structure joints.
? Use in both Master's courses and an industry focused short course in composites manufacturing.

The innovative joint solutions and understanding of the complex design and failure requirements for weight efficient joints between carbon fibre composite and embedded metallic inserts provides manufacturers of lightweight structures with hitherto unavailable guidance for new applications development. This will assist with the future manufacture of lightweight automotive and aircraft structures, both enabling very significant weight saving and manufacturing cost saving. The cost reduction being provided through the elimination of assembly stages and bonding jigs through the novel embedding technique.

These benefits will help increase market share for UK structures manufacturers and reduce CO2 emissions. 

Benefits to partners
? The design and manufacturing understanding provides:
? Substantial structural weight saving compared to current joint technology 
? Manufacturing cost savings through assembly process stages and labour cost reduction. 
? Reduced non-destructive evaluation of CFC structures and reduced structural testing cost for both prototype and production manufacture.

These benefits will reduce the manufacturing cost and weight of lightweight carbon fibre structures and confer greater damage resistance to high cost structures, thereby increasing market share, help provide new market segments for the lightweight composites industry through further metals replacement and win greater prize money and sponsorship for the Formula 1 team partner. 

Benefits to UK/Society - Since structural joining / assembly accounts for a considerable proportion of structural weight and a large proportion of manufacturing cost, the uptake of the results should increase the international competitiveness of the UK carbon fibre composites industry. 

Compression Moulding of Multi-Architecture Composites:
The findings from this CIMComp project have been extended into two Innovate UK industrial collaboration projects and into Prof Warrior's EPSRC Fellowship at the National Composites Centre.
The manufacturing process has attracted a lot of attention from UK composites industry and has been adopted as the demonstrator process in the GKN led Innovate UK project, Project Century. 

The tooling developed in CIMComp will be transferred to the NCC to be installed on the NCC press (03/17) and further studies on the effects of closing rate, parallelism and closing displacement/time strategies will further optimise the process. 


Innovative multi-material and multi-architecture preforms:


Innovative multi-material and multi-architecture preforming has resulted in a significant industrial and academic impact. 

One of the preforming concepts, multi-axial winding, received Innovate UK funding and the concept has been commercially launched by a UK company, Cygnet-Texkimp at JEC, Paris in March 2017 (https://www.composites-manufacturing.com/cygnet-texkimp-launches-world-first-robotic-3d-winding-machine-jec/ )

US Patent has been granted for novel 3D weaving concept (Potluri, Sharma, Jetavat, Method and apparatus for weaving a three-dimensional fabric, 
US 20150107715 A1). This is currently under technology licencing phase. 

Robotic Fibre placement concept has received further EPSRC Impact Acceleration funding, jointly with Formax Ltd (Hexcel composites) to develop an industrially relevant prototype machine. This development has a direct industrial relevance enabling company to significantly reduce prototyping time for customers. In addition, this machine will enable company to develop short runs currently not feasible on large multi-axial machines. 

Another braiding preforming research has resulted in EPSRC Impact Acceleration grant followed by a larger AMSCI grant with Sigma Composites for developing aviation fuel pipes and drive shafts.

Another aspect of the EPSRC project is to develop mulita-material fibre architectures for embedded sensors and active elements. The preliminary work has led to a collaborative R&amp;amp;D project with Sigma Composites for the development of embedded temperature, pressure and torque sensors and wireless transmission of sensory data. 

Additional route for impact is through the Catapult Centres; 3D weaving outcomes are currently under scaling-up through the National Composites Centre. 


Innovative preforming Research carried out through the EPSRC CIMCOMP has created a suite of novel preforming machines. These concepts are likely to be embedded in the proposed National Composites Materials Centre (NCMC) and at the National Composites Centre (NCC) and Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC). 

Economic and societal impact:
A new robotic preforming machine has been launched by a UK company which is likely to create additional employment and potential exports.
A UK company has developed a prototype Robotic Fibre Placement machine that would enable them to respond to customer needs and create new business opportunities. This prototype is likely to result in a full-scale manufacturing machine in the near future.


Multi-scale modelling to predict defect formation during infusion
This work is continuing via the Innovate UK/ Aerospace Technology Institute programme &amp;quot;Breakthrough Aerospace Material&amp;quot;, which is a &amp;pound;3.6m programme led by Sigmatex (a UK based woven fabric preform manufacturer). The project is taking the concepts developed around predictive modelling for textile preform structure, resin flow and defect formation and applying this to 3D woven preforms for complex geometric features and aerospace/ defence demonstrator components.
Techniques in flow process characterisation, and in particular permeability measurement, have been offered as a service to a number of companies. Notably the National Composites Centre offer our services routinely to member companies. In the last year a KTP with Formax (now Hexcel) was completed, which transferred permeability and formability measurement techniques into the UK materials supply industry for the first time. This capability is being further developed via an IDC funded EngD student at the company.
Techniques developed in this project were also used in a consultancy project for Airbus to analyse flow for a demonstrator aircraft component, resulting in an optimised tool design to minimise the possibility of defects.

Industrial Doctoral Centre 
The IDC has been fully integrated into wider CIMComp activities and will continue to provide a clear common focus to the EPSRC Future Composites Manufacturing Hub. Indeed, almost each of the 20 industrial supporters of the Hub application has pledged support for one or more IDC students in their Letter of Support. This now well-defined and co-located team of young engineers is making a recognisable contribution to composites research.
The IDC is providing manufacturing Research Engineers with a unique learning opportunity, have contributed to the delivery of the objectives of CIMComp and will continue to be an integral part of the new Future Composites Manufacturing Hub. It is strongly contributing to the delivery of the objectives of the National Composites Centre through the unique engagement with SMEs. The primary objective is to provide the UK composites manufacturing industry with a greater number of Research Engineers equipped with the necessary advanced technical and leadership skills required for effective adoption of new knowledge and technologies in composites manufacture.
CIMComp Researcher Away Days have been very effective in bringing REs in the IDC together with the much wider PhD and RA community across the whole network.




Relating to year end 2015/2016:

The fourth year of our operation has seen further growth in the funding of new projects and recruitment of staff; with accumulative core and associated leveraged funding totalling &amp;pound;13 million and &amp;pound;11 million, respectively. Further progress has been made in the Centre's core research themes, with 4 new collaborating partners joining CIMComp, bringing the total to 39 companies which are benefiting from the impact of our world-class research. 

Our role is also to lead on the formation of future UK fundamental research strategy in composites manufacturing, acting on behalf of the academic community and actively engaging with other EPSRC Centres and research groups across the UK. 

The first tranche of CIMComp core research programmes are reaching completion, generating new intellectual property leading to multiple new research contracts being awarded, further enhancing the CIMComp portfolio. In the last year we have launched five new feasibility studies, aimed at exploring potential step-change technologies around core themes aligned with the National Composites Strategy. These cover a range of topics including optimum materials design, smart materials, microwave processing and recycling. These follow our initial group of nine feasibility studies, which have gone on to secure over &amp;pound;3million in additional research funding. 

CIMComp outreach activities this year have continued to focus on wider dissemination and on international engagement. In particular we held an Open Day to disseminate our research and network with the wider community, attracting over 150 people. This preceded the IoMMM ICMAC conference in Bristol, organised by the CIMComp team and attracting world leading researchers in composites manufacturing. We are now a regular feature at the NEC Composites Engineering Show, with a dedicated stand and session in the open forum. We also led missions to Germany to understand the research and industrial landscapes and to establish research partnerships

Relating to year end 2014
The third year of our operation has seen further growth in the funding of new projects, recruitment of staff and additional funding to extend our Industrial Doctorate Centre; with leveraged funding totalling &amp;pound;18.7 million. Significant progress has been made in the Centre's core research themes, with 11 new collaborating partners joining CIMComp, bringing the total to 35 companies which are benefiting from the impact of applying world-class research in their industry sector. We have undergone an external mid-term review, which praised many of our activities and suggested a number of areas for further development to enhance the impact of our research. 

The EPSRC Centre for Innovative Manufacturing in Composites (CIMComp) was launched in July 2011 with a total of &amp;pound;7M sponsorship from EPSRC, industrial companies and the host universities. CIMComp was formed to focus on developing the next generation of composites manufacturing technologies through fundamental, multi-institutional research. Our role is also to lead on the formation of future UK fundamental research strategy in composites manufacturing, acting on behalf of the academic community and actively engaging with other EPSRC Centres and research groups across the UK. 

The first tranche of CIMComp core research programmes are reaching completion, generating new intellectual property leading to multiple new research contracts being awarded, further enhancing the CIMComp portfolio. Additional programmes include Life Cycle Simulation of Automotive Materials in Service: Impact of Ageing on Performance (Prof C Soutis) and Manufacturing of High Performance Cellulose Fibres to Replace Glass fibres &amp;amp; Carbon Fibre Precursors (Prof K Potter). In the last year we have launched two further core research programmes on Defect Generation Mechanisms in Thick and Variable Thickness Composite Parts (DefGen) and Compression Moulding of Multi-Architecture Composites (CMMC).

We have actively engaged with the wider composites manufacturing community through the funding of nine feasibility studies, each of six month duration, all of which complement our current activities and/or expand our remit into new areas of composites manufacturing technologies. As well as supporting the core CIMComp partners, through feasibility study funding, we have supported work at Exeter, Glasgow, Imperial College London, Queens Belfast and Sheffield universities. These projects have now completed and several have resulted in bids for further external funding.

CIMComp outreach activities this year have focused on wider dissemination and on international engagement. We are now a regular feature at the NEC Composites Engineering Show, which attracted over 12000 people last year. At the event we delivered a forum dedicated to CIMComp activity, which was apparently the best attended session over the two days. We also led a mission to Brazil to understand the research and industrial landscapes and to establish research partnerships. We have already hosted a reciprocal visit and are working towards the development of collaborative research proposals.





Below is information imported from ROS Sept 2014 and includes 1st and second year details:

Second Year 
In the second year we have continued to develop understanding of micro-scale behavior of reinforcements during manufacture by resin infusion. Based on statistical fibre distributions equivalent to measured arrangements, steady-state CFD simulations have allowed tow permeability to be calculated as a function of fibre volume fraction. Sensitivity of permeability to the fibre distribution has also been studied. A semi-analytical model for tow permeability has been developed and validated using the CFD studies. This work has shown that micro-scale permeabilities differ significantly from measured distributions. Feasibility of using transient flow simulations to predict void formation at the micro-scale has been demonstrated, allowing effects of capillary pressure on this phenomenon to be observed. Macro-scale flow analysis has focused on effects of handling on reinforcement permeability, demonstrated by deliberately shearing the reinforcement by controlled amounts and measuring the resulting permeability. We have also engaged actively in the latest international benchmark exercise for permeability, led by Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal, which aims ultimately to propose a standard permeability test method. The next stage in this work studies effects of tow path variability on flow for three-dimensional components, considering effects of draping combined with statistical variability. Work on cure modelling has focused on variability, and here a stochastic approach has been applied to study the uncertainties/ performance trade offs in cure processes. Cure testing has established variability in model parameters for cure of an epoxy system, and these have been used to simulate cure for a flat panel comparing two stochastic techniques. This allows, for example, distributions of cure time and temperature overshoot to be predictied. The next stage will incorporate variability in tow orientation, using the same statistical model as used for flow simulation.

Contribution Method: Permeability data has been provided to ESI software for their customers to use. They have now started to direct customers to Nottingham as their preferred partner for measurement of permeability data

Concepts for embedded fittings have been proposed.

The 1st stage of small lap joint manufacture and testing has been completed which has provided new understanding of spiked titanium insert plate design and insert CFC laminate failure behaviour.

A cost study of insert manufacturing technology has been carried out which highlights the benefits of the CMT welding process.

Patents, technology, software, technology transfer/commericalisation of processes used, products in marketplace etc.

AM02 - Structural Joints using Novel Embedded Inserts

Joint applications for the industry partners have been assessed and a range of joints defined. Concepts for embedded fittings have been proposed. The 1st stage of small lap joint manufacture and testing has been completed which has provided new understanding of spiked titanium insert plate design and insert / CFC laminate failure behaviour. A cost study of insert manufacturing technology has been carried out which highlights the benefits of the CMT welding process. 2nd stage small lap joint testing has provided understanding of bonded / embedded pin joint failure behaviour. This has enabled the design of novel stepped lap and tapered scarf small test joint. These 3rd stage joints are currently being manufactured and comprise novel titanium insert designs with- straight pin, ball ended pin, dimpled pin configuration. These designs will compare the effect of high and low stiffness adhesive and adhesive free joint assembly. A target for optimised joint failure behaviour has been defined to enable insert and joint design optimisation. This is to match the strength of multi-step lap joints using standard high strength paste adhesive and to provide high strain to failure 500% greater and to show minimal susceptibility to surface preparation variability.

Contribution Method: Since structural joining/assembly accounts for considerable structural weight and a large proportion of manufacturing cost, the uptake of the results should increase the international competitiveness of the UK carbon fibre composites industry

KP01 - Novel Approaches to Manufacture of Complex Geometries

Work to date has got two PhD students under way in detailed studies of how conventional woven reinfocements are manipulated in manual forming processes. The work of the two students is expected to separate into two streams, one looking at robotic automation the other looking at maximising the efficiency of current processes. We have developed an integrated approach to predict formability of textile reinforcements from first principles. This involves unit cell modelling (using the TexGen schema) to predict the mechanics of textiles from two properties and the fabric geometry. This provides input data for an FE simulation of reinforcement forming, which can predict the deformed fibre pattern and wrinkling due to compressive stresses in the tow directions. Sensitivity studies have revealed the influence of textile structure and tow properties on formability, demonstrated initially for a hemispherical forming tool.

Currently in negotiation with a major composites software vendor to licence some UoB manufacturing simulation technology for incorporation into their software suites.

KP01 - Novel Approches to the Manufacture of Complex Geometries from Broadgoods

Focus has been on developing an in-depth understanding of how reinforcements can be manipulated into geometry rapidly and defect-free; including an understanding of how experienced operators (supported by NCC) manipulate material by investigating the grips, tools, and techniques used in lay-up onto a series of increasingly difficult geometries. It has led to the identification of an alternate approach to manual lay-up involving offline preshearing to conduct cloth reorganisation that minimises the amount of tool/ply interactions needed. Examples have shown up to 60% touch time improvements are possible with increased repeatability and reductions in non-productive tasks such as heating. It does not impact on quality, and is now being used to inform on alternate processes for automated manufacturing.

A relationship between reinforcement's drape properties and geometry has been investigated in parallel. Differences in lay-up times of 5-fold across the geometries, 2-fold across the materials, as well as quality variation per operator were seen. By reviewing properties such as shear stiffness, tack, and their interaction, the requirements leading to rapid lay-up have been identified. This may allow for the development of improved materials to meet rate and quality, and has been taken forward by exploring the shear energy in forming - using it to define the work to form a feature or geometry. This may allow for the design of immediately more-manufacturable parts. Work has also been made in areas such as the laminator's motivation, and the acceptance criteria used to better define the impacts of GD+T and a measurable quality definition.

In terms of P&amp;amp;P, research has targeted the use of novel low cost systems such as transfer pad printing with some success. The research has identified other higher value areas for impact and has been exploring solutions, including a method for protective film removal that may be applied to manual as well as automated manufacturing.

Bristol has a KTP with Cobham Mission Equipment, and this programme is being used to support CME in their aim to become an educated user and procurer of composites structures. As technologies are developed they are being demonstrated to the NCC, and it is intended to develop them further through the NCC when appropriate.

Contribution Method: Developing a relationship with AMSCI (Advanced Manufacturing Supply Chain Initiative) and the Composite Skills Alliance to ensure research impacts for wider industry and society. We have worked to link together SME's to form an effective network and have seen some success in this area with collaborations between SME's forming

PP03 - Innovative multi-material and multi-architectural preforms

We have made significant progress in the first year on developing concepts for 3D fibre demonstrating proof of principle of 3D fibre preforming.

The achievements are:



We built a prototype 3D weaving machine machine and demonstrated basic concept of ply drop in a 3D weave. This will be further extended to create near-net preforms during this year.



A robotic fibre placement concept is also under development. This will enable us to create multifunctional preforms incorporating smart sensors as well as appropriate (DCFP) preform technologies. This will be available in the next three months.



Work is also underway to create carbon tows with multi-functional materials through methods of surface printing and co-mingling. We have produced preliminary samples. We will continue to work on this multi-functionality through the year.

In December 2011, we installed a prototype 3D weaving machine at US Air Force Materials Labs (Dayton, Ohio). The cost of building the machine was paid for by the US Air Force. This has been a significant achievement to the research team at Manchester. We are in the process of developing next generation 3D weaving process.


AL04 - Multi-scale Modelling to Predict Formation During Resin Infusion

In the first year we have made significant progress in understanding the micro-scale behavior of reinforcements during manufacture by resin infusion. We have characterised the fibre distributions within tows (fire bundles) within composite reinforcements, and have developed a detailed statistical description of these. This has been used to generate virtual models, which have been used within CFD studies to simulate flow during infusion. Steady-state simulations allow the distribution of tow permeabilities to be predicted, and here a key discovery is that the mean value is almost an order of magnitude lower than that predicted by (previously accepted) analytical models. Transient flow simulations are now starting to determine the conditions for void formation. At the meso-scale (unit cell level) we have used MRI to image the flow of fluid through reinforcement during infusion. This is the first application of this approach to composites manufacture, and we have used this to identify void formation between tows. Work on cure modelling will also focus on variability, and here a stochastic simulation methodology is being developed to study the uncertainties/ performance tradeoffs in cure processes. Initial work has focused on reviewing the key sources of variability and implementing a robust methodology to model composite cure and distortion that allows efficient incorporation of variability information. The work currently focuses on the development of a Monte Carlo scheme for uncertainty simulation of cure and the development of a sensing setup that will allow the estimation of surface heat transfer variability in an industrial environment.

During the last year we have provided a database of (non-confidential) reinforcement permeability to ESI Software, so that this can be made available on-line to their users. Nottingham are the first University to make such data available in this way, and this will be a significant benefit to the user community, enabling them to use manufacturing simulation tools for composites.

Defect Generation Mechanisms in Thick &amp;amp; Variable Thickness Composite Parts -
Understanding, Predicting and Mitigation:

The hyper-viscoelastic material model implemented in the finite element software Abaqus that was developed earlier in the project has been deployed in a number of use-cases. These were validated against experimental data for each. A resin cure model was also implemented in Abaqus to extend the range of applicability into the autoclave phase of composites manufacture. The use cases were: gaps and overlaps, corner radius, stepped laminate and tapered laminate.
The key deliverable was a working model for the prediction of fibre path defects, driven by laminate consolidation. This was achieved and shown to work for several industrially inspired use cases, each of which was validated against experimental data.

The most notable achievement was the development of the new constitutive model for uncured prepreg. Developing the constrolled wrinkle formation cases was also a good achievement.


Compression Moulding of Multi-Architecture Composites:
The portfolio of compression moulding research within CIMCOMP included a range of complementary experimental and simulation activities. In the experimental work infrastructure for automated preforming and for fully instrumented, temperature-controlled moulding was developed; adding a resin spray technology to enhance the capability of our established discontinuous preforming process and building an instrumented press facility. Experimentally-based projects included: study in the use of commercial materials, in direct collaboration with industrial partner Hexcel; development of robotic processes for on-line production of charge preforms; development and conditioning of materials and experimental study of flow of multiphase materials. Developing simulation tools for this technology is vital to the industrial uptake of the technology and a project on combined Eulerian-Lagrangian finite element analysis of the in-mould flow has made good progress.
A study of the compression moulding process of multi-architecture commercially available pre-impregnated carbon fibre fabrics was undertaken with an industrial partner. The aim was to deliver net-shaped complex parts with low cycle time. In these complex parts the designer will align the fibre direction in a unidirectional fabric with the principal stresses for primary loading and will use a discontinuous fibre compound to create complex features such as ribs and to carry secondary stress states arising from off-axis loading or damage tolerance requirements. Typically complex components of this type require labour intensive preforming or laminating stages and post-cure machining operations, and the process here has the potential to deliver a step change in part cost.
In addition, a process for manufacturing high volume fraction carbon fibre/epoxy moulding compound charges for compression moulding was developed. This process used our established discontinuous fibre chop and spray technology and has incorporated a resin spray facility to produce precisely metered pre-impregnated charges of, typically, 50% volume fraction. The resin is heated before spraying to minimise the viscosity, ensuring good dispersion and wet out of the chopped fibres during the deposition stage. The charge is then chemically B-staged to increase the viscosity before compression moulding. The project characterised the effect of flow on fibre architecture and studied and reported on achievable levels of fibre waviness in compression moulding.
Cranfield led the work on incorporating mechanical fasteners into the composite material using their embedded spikey insert metal to composite joining technology. A number of novel spike layouts were manufactured and tested, advancing this existing technology within CIMComp. The project was based around two challenges: Co-moulding of UD prepreg with chopped fibre moulding compound and metallic inserts embedding to provide undiminished mechanical performance and insert attachment strength. 
A design study was completed for a luxury sports car body panel using the hybrid HexMC&amp;reg; and Hexply&amp;reg; prepreg compression moulding process. With the help of Altair software on which a combination of topology, topography, and layup optimisation was carried out, a weight saving of over 50% was foreseen for the tonneau cover. 
Tooling for high-pressure compression moulding of multi-architecture composites for a representative element of the tonneau panel was constructed. In addition, a novel manufacturing technique for precise, rapid placement of the unidirectional skins was developed. This manufacturing technique takes advantage of UD prepreg tapes B-staging, used to ensure UD alignment during co-moulding with SMC. 
Locally embedding small amounts of UD tape on SMC skins has been shown to increase CFC mechanical performance beyond any traditionally used QI layup, while keeping the ability of short fibres to form complex shapes in short cycle times. Young's modulus values of around 55 GPa and ultimate strength around 550 MPa were found. In addition, the UD confers very low mechanical property variability. Standard deviation of flexural strength and modulus are reduced from 15% (SMC) to 3% (SMC-UD). This is a major advance for composites designers, who will be able to reduce safety factors on composites structural designs, guaranteeing both weight saving and material cost saving.
In addition, a thorough process optimisation study has been completed, demonstrating the possibility to cure SMC-UD multi-architecture specimens in 1 min 30 sec. This led to estimate a total cycle time of less than 3 minute for the tonneau cover, including cutting, transferring, and other additional steps. Thermoplastic and pseudo thermoplastic matrices composites have also been manufactured, in order to assess their high time-saving potential. As a result, continuous fibre polyamide organosheets provided the highest manufacturing time to light weighting potential. However, the impossibility to manufacture them with a constant temperature mould as per SMC means their production cost is higher than for SMC-UD hybrid moulding.
A further study has been carried out to find solutions for efficient metallic fasteners embedment into SMC-UD multi-architecture structural parts. A mould tool design was developed using a novel fitting location technique. The Mould Tool Locator allows fasteners to be clipped-in and co-processed with SMC and UD. A manufacturing technique has been developed to ensure interlocking of the fasteners into the SMC structure, without compromising cycle time, resulting from the preferential flow of the short fibres.
The manufactured coupons including embedded fasteners have been tested to failure in asymmetrical bearing and pull-out, in order to be representative of the application's load case scenarios. The embedded fasteners' strength in those load cases are respectively 50% and 85% of that of an equivalent bolt. However, in addition to not being vulnerable to creep, the resulting fracture of the embedded fasteners themselves around their welds provides a much more reliable failure mode than bolts. Both the composite and the metal-to-CFC interface remain intact. An embedded M6 thread fastener can resist 6 kN in asymmetrical bearing, and 10 kN in pull-out.
Key findings: The project was completed and key findings were that high structural performance compression-moulded components were produced including; multi-fibre architecture materials, 3D structures with a range of thicknesses in one moulding and incorporating metallic fasteners.


Structural Joints using Novel Embedded Inserts:
The developed tensile fitting design has enabled the manufacture of joints, which are insensitive to surface preparation and require only a 50% mass increase in the bolted area, compared to a 1000% mass increase for a bolted joint design. The pull through joint type developed in the project shows a strength benefit of 250% compared to baseline bolted joints.
The following has been achieved:
? An understanding of embedded insert / CFC laminate joint failure and design and manufacturing details has been realised. This enables the informed design of weight efficient CFC laminate to metal joints.

? Manufacturing techniques for embedding and mould location of metallic inserts have been developed which minimise fibre damage and ensure accurate insert alignment. 

? Strength and weight comparison of the project developed joint designs with conventional best practice bonding and bolting has been made.

? Demonstration and validation of the novel developed joints through full scale structural element manufacture and testing has been carried out. 

? Guidelines for metal to CFC laminate joint design for the main loading types have been complied to enable translation of the results to future application. 


Innovative Preforms:
During 2015-16, we completed the development of various 3D preforming technologies and multi-functional preforms. 
Robotic Fibre Placement:
? Preforming technology to deposit fibres and fabric patches on a curved tool has been developed. Additionally, a product demonstrator for tufting s 3D woven stiffner with an NCF skin has been developed with the industrial partners. Concept of quasi-interlacement has been developed for improved damage tolerance. 
 
? 3D weaving: Warp and weft tensioning systems have been developed. Currently researching the influence of tension on preform properties. 
 
? 3D Braiding: Tubular 3D braiding has been demonstrated. 


? Multi-scale hybridisation: two different methods of mixing thermoplastic fibres with reinforcing fibres have been explored, co-mingling and micro-wrapping. Both the techniques demonstrated improvements in damage tolerance and damage resistance. Further technique to incorporate CNT(Carbon Nanotubes) at the interface is being explored).
 
? Multi-functional preforms: fibrous materials for active heating and sensing have been incorporated at the preform stage. These preforms have been converted into composite laminates and tested.

Outcomes:
? Development of a full set of 3D preforming capability for creating novel multi-material preforms
? A product demonstrator for integrating T stiffener with NCG skin (preform development completed and a composite panel is being made.
? Co-mingling and micro-wrapping technologies have been demonstrated. Two publications are being submitted to demonstrate the improvements in damage tolerance and healing properties.
? Multi-functional preforms for sensing and heating: preforms have been developed. Composites are under development.

Notable achievements are tension control for 3D weaving, multi-material composites with improved damage tolerance and healing and product demonstrator 'tufted T stiffner-skin joint' and 3D woven PI joint.

Multi-scale modelling to predict defect formation during infusion
This project studies the origin of defects which arise during resin infusion processes (eg RTM) and their link to process and material variability. A stochastic modelling methodology was developed combining forming simulation with commercial flow modelling, linked by a novel interface which incorporates materials variability and predicts the resulting permeability. This allows the range of likely outcomes to be predicted in the form of a map showing the likelihood of defect formation across the surface of a part. Based on this the materials and/or process can be optimized to minimize defect formation and scrap rate.
In the final year of CIMComp the modelling approach was further refined and initial validation trials were conducted for a benchmark (double dome) geometry. This involved manufacture of transparent tooling which was used to visualise flow and defect formation during infusion, and then repeated trials to characterise process variability. Results suggested that real-life variability in flow is well represented by the model. Simulations were found to be conservative in terms of prediction of defects remaining in the final mouldings, which both provides confidence to industry users but also indicates the need for further fundamental research into defect formation mechanisms, potentially requiring a computationally expensive multi-phase flow approach to achieve highly accurate results.

Novel Approaches to the Manufacture of Complex Geometries:
The focus of the theme has been the integration of various aspects of the developing understanding of the relationships between reinforcement materials, tool geometry and lay-up of complex components, to deliver significant improvements in the rate an quality of manufacture. These have included developing the first universal lay-up tool to support operator training in manual lay-up, through to the first demonstration of the lay-up of a typical complex sandwich panel by an industrial robot.
? The first (known of) in-depth study of the factors controlling rate and quality of production in manual lay-up has been completed, offering opportunities to design part geometries and materials to deliver minimum labour costs.
? Low cost approaches (in software and hardware) to support shop floor staff to deliver a well-controlled and high quality lay-up have been developed to a demonstration stage. 
? The design and build of a unique manual layup tool has been achieved which is highly successful and has widespread adoption on an international scale.

Multi-scale Process Modelling
In the fourth and final year we have concentrated on macro-scale flow analysis, incorporating models of meso-scale and micro-scale variability developed in previous years.
Permeability data has been provided to ESI software for their customers to use. Related KTP project with partners Formax has established process modelling and permeability measurement techniques within the company. They are the first reinforcement supplier worldwide to demonstrate this capability. The flow modelling approach will allow manufacturers to consider the likelihood of defect formation, and therefore scrap rate, at the process design stage.
Development of TexGen has continued, responding to the needs of users within and outside CIMComp and delivering new functionality and model accuracy. Downloads of TexGen have exceeded 20,000 and there have been two major releases in the last year. 
? Capability to model 3D features based on multi-layer preforms implemented.
? Interface with weaving machine developed
? A collaboration with RWTH Aachen provided a software tool for providing machine information for 3D woven profiles and generating TexGen models of the flat, as-woven weave patterns.

Innovative multi-material and multi-architecture preforms:
During the final year we have completed the development of various 3D preforming technologies and multi-functional preforms. Product demonstrators will be developed in the remaining duration of the project.

? Multi-functional preforms for sensing and heating - preforms have been developed and composites are under development.

Structural Joints using Novel Embedded Inserts:
The focus of this theme is the novel attachment fittings and moulding techniques for low cost manufacture of high strength, low weight mechanical joints for future carbon fibre composite structures. Outputs include design, manufacture and test of joint structural elements and demonstrator structures.
Demonstrator Application - a Formula 1 suspension arm has been designed and manufacturing is in progress with design engineers.
Achievements:
? Understanding of embedded plate/CFC laminate joint failure and design and manufacturing details.
? Specifications for embedded metal plate/CFC laminate joint manufacture.
? Structurally demonstrated, higher strength and lower weight joints compared to conventional bolting
? Demonstration and validation of joints through full-scale structural element manufacture and testing
? Guidelines for mould tooling design for the location of embedded metallic fittings
? The developed tensile fitting design has enabled the manufacture of joints which are insensitive to surface preparation and require only a 50% mass increase in the bolted area, compared to a 1000% mass increase for a bolted joint design.
Since structural joining/assembly accounts for a considerable proportion of structural weight and a large proportion of manufacturing cost, the uptake of the results should increase the international competitiveness of the UK carbon fibre composites industry.

Cost Modelling
? Cost comparison and Decision Support Took is being prepared for industry application studies
? Materials and process selection tool/expert system, possible software frameworks are being investigated.
? Databases of materials, tooling and equipment costs - a materials/process database has been set up.
The expected long term impact is to enable industry to assess the commercial advantages of using new composites technologies and to make investment decisions for new applications. These activities should increase composite manufacturing turnover and enable growth of carbon fibre composites into new markets.

Defect Generation Mechanisms during forming/consolidation: 
This project sets out to address the formation of defects in parts manufactured from polymer matrix continuous fibre reinforced composite materials. The collective learning from the experimental and numerical work will be used to develop strategies to mitigate against defect formation during manufacture. The key focus will be on out-of-plane waviness, which is the end result of a complex interaction of factors.
Defect Generation Mechanisms in Thick &amp;amp; Variable Thickness Composite Parts - Understanding, Predicting and Mitigation - This work is divided into exploration of the fundamentals, implementation and application respectively. The implementation phase is concluding with good results for the model development. A fundamental understanding of the compaction process for prepregs from the first year has allowed the development of new finite element material models for prediction of the material compaction and flow during the debulk phase of composites manufacture. Modelling work on the resin cure for the autoclave phase is also well underway. The models have been validated against a comprehensive set of experimental data and are now being applied to application examples. More ambitious validation cases are now being designed to create samples with induced wrinkles.
Numerical Modeling of Dry Fabric Deformation Mechanisms - The main focus of this work is the development of numerical tools to capture deformations which occur in multi-layered preforms during manufacturing processes. Specific attention is being given to the deformations which occur through the thickness. Work performed so far has focused on modelling the kinematic interactions which occur between layers of fabric at the meso-scale and how the internal architecture of the fabric evolves as a result. Mechanical models are currently being developed to quantitatively determine the physical response of these interactions so that mechanical properties can be established for upscaling. The final stage of this process will be to use the virtual mechanical properties as input into a macro-scale drape model whereby multi-layered interactions and through-thickness deformations can be captured.

? Extensive experimental database for compaction
? Modelling of compaction of tapered laminate
? Design of complex test specimen for wrinkle generation


Compression Moulding of Multi-Architecture Composites:
The aim for development of compression moulding composites manufacturing technologies is to deliver a step change in specific mechanical properties and process cycle times. Compression moulding processes have shown significant potential in process cycle time and waste level reduction. 
Three complementary projects are underway:
(1) Commercial autoclave prepreg systems have been successfully characterised for high-rate compression moulding. Ongoing work is validating flow models which will simulate fibre flow within the different architectures.
(2) A process for manufacturing carbon fibre/epoxy moulding compound charges has been developed. Over 40 plaques moulded. Ongoing work is based on developing lower cycle times using resin chemistries.
(3) The multi architectures in (1) have been used in an industrial demonstrator to deliver a 56% weight saving. Ongoing work is to improve interlaminar properties and to develop mechanical fastener processing technologies.

Compression moulding process has shown significant potential in process cycle time and waste level reduction. Preliminary structural results show great promise but require enhancements of interlaminar fracture thoughness to realise full potential. 
The potential is to create manufacturing process which would significantly reduce mass of automotive vehicles, leading to reduced fuel consumption and emissions.

1. Development of highly novel composites manufacturing methods in the form of a world first 3D textile optimisation algorithms, quadaxial braider, AFP tow shearing, automated lamination tools. These are some of the key research outcomes from CIMComp's 22 projects that are currently running. 3D Textile optimisation algorithms have shown the potential to provide a step-change shift in the way engineers design with composite materials - challenging the &amp;quot;black metal&amp;quot; design philosophy which is widely adopted. The quadaxial braider opens up new and exciting markets for rapid deposition of complex structures, providing orientated fibres in a combined automated process, applicable to sectors such as oil &amp;amp; gas, aerospace and automotive. AFP tow shearing prototype development has shown the potential to revolutionise the automation of complex high value composites structures that have tight turning radii and bends in their design, without compromise to laminate integrity and mechanical performance. This process is planned to be integrated into the NCC core research program in 2015. Automated lamination tools designed to mimic handlay prepreg compaction techniques on complex geometry has demonstrated potential gains in production volume, with high repeatability

2. Development of highly successful routes for engaging with the UK composites community using well managed feasibility studies which pump-prime early career research activity. This process was found to be the most successful way in which to engage and drive innovation within the composites academic research arena. The CIMComp feasibility studies were conceived and implemented in such a way that an early career postdoc could be employed for 6 months to develop a potential disruptive technology. Included in this package was equipment and expertise support/mentoring provided by the CIMComp team. A rigorous reporting and dissemination process was devised which aided in the successful delivery of all nine funded projects; four of which have already gone onto receive major funding awards. 

3. Increased research capability generated from delivery of the first UK training modules in composites manufacturing at PhD/EngD level through our Industrial Doctorate Centre (IDC). Comprehensive training in advanced composites at a postgraduate level was not being offered in the UK which reflected on the shortage of qualified engineers in this sector. The IDC now offers 10 units to the IDC and CIMComp researchers in order to deliver highly qualified composites engineers for tomorrows manufacturing challenges. The vision is to offer these training modules out to other academic institutions and industry in the near future as the demand for this already exists.

4. The research activity has opened up new research questions on what technologies are required in order to create a magnitude change to the composites manufacturing sector. The research conducted within CIMComp has led to the view that new disruptive technologies are needed in order to create a step change in the way composites are used and therefore opening up exciting and lucrative new markets. Entirely new approaches to 'product design' and 'design for manufacture' are required to enable engineers to take full advantage of the wide range of design freedoms that composites offer. This can be achieved by tailoring all aspects of the component design and manufacture, ensuring that the modelling, preforms, matrix and processing are truly optimised for the component in question and are not bound by current standard practice or the 'black metal' design philosophy. Development and implementation of this approach is seen as the future role for CIMComp over the next decade. 


Below is information for previous years imported from ROS:

The second year of our operation has seen a major growth in the funding of new projects, recruitment of staff and launch of an Industrial Doctorate Centre; with leveraged funding totalling &amp;pound;10 million. At the same time, significant progress has been made in the Centre's core research themes. 13 new collaborating partners have joined CIMComp, bringing the total to 23 companies which are benefiting from the impact of applying world-class research in their industry sector. Significant progress has been realised within the CIMComp core research programmes, which has generated new intellectual property leading to multiple new research contracts being awarded, further enhancing the CIMComp portfolio. Additional programmes include Robustness-performance optimisation for automated composite manufacture (Dr Alex Skordos), and DefGen (Dr Stephen Hallet) working on understanding, predicting and mitigation of defect generation mechanisms. Through this activity, we have been able to draw in new academic and research talent to further strengthen CIMComp's national and international standing; included in this is the creation of two independent fellowship positions investigating 3D fibre reinforced composites (Dr Xuesen Zeng), and Next generation automated fibre placement processing (Dr Eric Kim). We have actively engaged with the wider composites manufacturing community through the funding of nine feasibility studies, each of six month duration, all of which complement our current activities and/or expand our remit into new areas of composites manufacturing technologies. The aim of this activity is to utilise CIMComp's resources to aid in the development of ideas which go forward into newly funded programmes. As well as supporting the core CIMComp partners, through feasibility study funding, we are supporting work at Exeter, Glasgow, Imperial College London, Queens Belfast and Sheffield universities. The research described above is supported by industry advisors and therefore has significant relevance to current industry challenges in composites manufacturing. Results from this work are still embryonic; however identified pathways to future exploitation are varied and include licensing and exploitation by the Centres Tier 1 partners, development through Catapults such as the National Composites Centre (NCC) or the Manufacturing Technology Centre (MTC). Funding has been obtained to allow secondment our fellowship researchers to other academic institutions or industry in order to disseminate the developed technology for avenues of further exploitation. The research conducted within the Centre is focused on fundamental understanding of composites manufacturing. The research has significant and direct impact on industry practices and therefore serves to allow greater adoption and exploitation of polymeric composites.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Relating to year end 2015/2016
In addition to the six projects, the latest CIMComp call for feasibility studies looked to fund TRL 1-2 research in our priority themes, which will facilitate fundamental step-change technologies for composites manufacturing. The themes were aligned with CIMComp's priority areas and the 2015 UK Composites Strategy. CIMComp involvement will help to bring these studies forward to a point where new funding opportunities are created and should help grow the capabilities of the UK. Nine feasibility studies have been funded by CIMComp and these have gone on to collectively secure over &amp;pound;3 milion in research grants from a variety of National and EU funding sources.


Relating to year end 2014
The numerous developed technologies within CIMComp will look to move up the TRL levels by either direct industrial funding or through collaborative R&amp;amp;D funding mechanisms such as InnovateUK or Horizon 2020. The various industrial partners (Tier 1 and Project Partners) are well positioned to take forward the developed technologies for exploitation. Other routes forward include utilising our links with the National Composites Centre (NCC), Manufacturing Technology Centre (MTC) and Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC) who are all members of the HVM Catapult. Through these routes, the technologies can be further developed, taking them through the applied research stage and for exploitation by the various industrial members of the HVM Catapult Centres.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>110B48A1-A680-49E7-9213-03B0986FDD9A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-3441495358.42379147748a7f8</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and
