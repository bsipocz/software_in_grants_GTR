The 14-3-3s cuddle and squeeze their captured proteins, which leads to changes in glucose uptake and other processes. One aim is to help explain how insulin and exercise control many processes in our bodies, and provide biomarkers to track changes caused by diabetes and obesity. We also found that many proteins latch onto 14-3-3s when human cells are exposed to growth factors. Growth factors are hormones that activate our cells to absorb nutrients, grow, divide and move, and cancer cells have overactivated responses to growth factors. Our biochemical analyses therefore provide the fundamental underpinnings that will lead to better ways to monitor peoples health status, prevent type II diabetes, and develop and test new drugs to treat cancers and other diseases.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>How a few intracellular signalling pathways, including PI 3-kinase/PKB, MAPK/p90RSK and AMPK, stimulate wide-ranging changes in cellular behaviours is a fascinating problem, made all the more pressing because these pathways are deregulated in diabetes and cancers, while AMPK mediates beneficial responses to exercise and the anti-diabetic drug metformin. Using 14-3-3 capture and release, combined with differential proteomics, we are discovering how the PI 3-kinase/PKB, MAPK/p90RSK, and AMPK signalling pathways stimulate the phosphorylation and binding to 14-3-3s of large, overlapping subsets of proteins. For example, the Rab GTPase activating protein AS160 is phosphorylated and binds to 14-3-3s in response to insulin, while the related TBC1D1 binds to 14-3-3s in response to AMPK activators. Our biochemical and transgenic mouse experiments suggest that the relative sensitivity of glucose uptake to insulin and/or exercise in different tissues may reflect the different tissue distributions of AS160 and TBC1D1. Biochemical dissection of other target proteins is revealing new mechanisms to explain how insulin, growth factors and nutrients regulate vesicle trafficking, signalling, mitochondrial biogenesis and gene expression. One exciting new project stems from the discovery that EGF stimulates the MAPK/p90RSK-mediated phosphorylation and 14-3-3-binding of multiple components of a transcriptional network implicated in spinocerebellar ataxias, dopaminergic disorders and Ewings family sarcomas. These findings suggest a new hypothesis about how altered growth factor control of neural crest differentiation might contribute to these diseases, and suggest 14-3-3s as therapeutic targets for tumours. Another ambitious goal of our 14-3-3-phosphoproteomics approaches is to identify a core list of proteins that have distinctive signalling signatures and whose 14-3-3-binding status could be used as biomarkers to report on which signalling pathways are active in healthy and disease tissues, and how they respond to drugs.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>79000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MC_UU_12016/9</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>F3822669-BB5A-4BB4-BAE0-DCB9DE36E092</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Generic Health Relevance</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>160D22D0-5677-4513-A0AC-7F3526B7F336</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Metabolic and Endocrine</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>CF950C9A-DB16-4E23-8AEB-94548777BCA1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>1.1  Normal biological development and functioning</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
