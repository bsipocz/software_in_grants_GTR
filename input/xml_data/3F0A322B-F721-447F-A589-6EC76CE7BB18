We propose to focus on civil organizations based in the affected regions themselves, specifically within the west-central Mexican states of Michoac&amp;aacute;n and Jalisco, a region with high levels of criminal violence.

It is increasingly recognized that treating organized crime as a matter of security is insufficient and can even exacerbate the problem, and that organized crime must be addressed through holistic strategies that include development consistent with human rights, providing opportunities for a dignified economic, social and political life outside the sphere of criminal organizations. In the state of Michoac&amp;aacute;n, for example, after &amp;quot;self-defence&amp;quot; vigilante groups ousted local police accused of serving organized crime in 2014, the federal government established a Commission for Security and Integral Development promising to deliver equitable and participative development to the region.

Yet holistic strategies are notoriously difficult to execute when, as often in Mexico, state institutions in the affected regions are captured, wholly or partially, by the same criminal organizations and their associates. In these contexts, criminal organizations can for example use their hold over local (and state) government to frustrate the designs of national government, as well as of international agencies.

Researchers and policy-makers suspect that civil society has an important role to play in these contexts. Civil society can monitor the actions of state institutions, insist on participating in development projects, resist development that hurts or fails to benefit vulnerable groups, and advocate strategies that do meet the needs of the broader population, thus helping to offset the hold of criminal organizations overhose institutions, as well as creating alternative livelihoods for the population. However, although there have been some studies of the role of national (and international) civil society in holding state institutions to account, the potential role of civil organizations within the regions themselves is little studied. This is our focus.

The few studies conducted, and initial research by the applicants, suggest that civil society organizations are often themselves hemmed in by organized crime, and find it difficult to resist penetration by organized crime, much less to advance an agenda contrary to its interests. This helps to account, indeed, for the reluctance of many researchers to conduct sustained fieldwork in these contexts.

Despite the forbidding panorama, the project will use comparative ethnography, following strict protocols designed to mitigate risk to researchers and research subjects, to identify and explain positive examples of organizations which have played an effective role in holding state institutions to a human rights agenda, and specifically one designed to offset the noxious effects of organized crime activities.

Project outputs will include an academic monograph co-authored by Guerra (CIDE), Maldonado (Colegio de Michoac&amp;aacute;n) and Stack (Aberdeen), and a volume edited by Stack to include papers from an international conference in London and others chapters co-authored by the applicants with the postdoctoral RAs.

Unusually for an academic research project, we have chosen to put the policy outputs on an equal footing with the academic outputs. To this end, we have incorporated 2 policy analysts Domingo (ODI) and Jesperson (RUSI) as Co-Investigators. We have followed their instructions from the outset to ensure that the data collection and analysis will be adequate to the task of producing a series of well-grounded policy briefs, applicable to other regions of Mexico (and the world) affected by criminal violence.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project is geared primarily to benefit a) development actors concerned about the effects of criminal violence on development policies, and b) security actors looking to develop a holistic strategy to address criminal violence. It will also be of benefit to civil organizations a) within regions affected by criminal violence (such as the organizations on which we focus), and b) outside those regions (national and international) but with an interest in supporting the work of organizations within the regions. By benefiting those organizations, it will also benefit Mexican citizens and especially those living within the regions affected by criminal violence, as well as being applicable to the many other regions of the world in which criminal violence is of increasing concern to development and security actors.

In order to achieve this ambitious goal, and unusually for an academic research project, we have chosen to put the policy outputs on an equal footing with the academic outputs. To this end, we have incorporated 2 policy analysts Domingo (ODI) and Jesperson (RUSI) as Co-Investigators. We have followed their instructions from the outset to ensure that the data collection and analysis will be adequate to the task of producing a series of well-grounded policy briefs. The briefs should be applicable not only to the other regions of Mexico affected by criminal violence, but also to the other regions of the world where criminal violence is obstructing the development that is supposed to mitigate it.

To ensure that the briefs will be applicable elsewhere, and because the chosen region of west-central Mexico is highly diverse, Domingo and Jesperson have asked the academic researchers to compare a significant number of sub-regions within the broader region. This will also help to ensure that the briefs are context-sensitive. The briefs will draw on the comparative data to demonstrate in what ways the potential role of civil organizations can vary even within a single region, and advise development and security actors how to tailor their strategies for civil organizations to specific sub-regional contexts. We have therefore agreed to include 7 sub-regions within the study, to be studied by the applicants Guerra, Maldonado, Stack and 4 postdoctoral RAs.

As well as ensuring that the briefs are applicable, Domingo and Jesperson have set out an agenda for ensuring that the briefs are suitable for and taken up by the relevant development and security actors, as well as the local, national and international civil organizations:
1. We will consult thoroughly on Domingo and Jesperson's drafts of the briefs by a) re-interviewing members of region-based civil organizations to seek their views on the draft briefs, and b) debating the drafts with a range of development actors and civil organizations at a policy-makers' workshop in Mexico City. The prominent Mexican think-tank Fundar, A.C. has expressed an interest in hosting the workshop.
2. We will follow up on the briefs by a) returning to the sub-regions to encourage the civil organizations to consider the final recommendations, and b) Domingo and Jesperson will be responsible for publicizing the briefs to development and security actors, through the channels of their institutions (ODI and RUSI), as well as to national and international civil organizations.

Finally, several of the applicants have experience in writing for media audiences, and all the researchers will be expected to disseminate findings through these channels in 2018. In addition, once the policy briefs have been confirmed, the Aberdeen-based RA will be tasked with setting up a website with social network functionality, gearing the information toward a variety of web audiences.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-07-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-11-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>581591</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/P006167/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>020361E1-B8CA-49FD-9149-27D31D21C7A3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AE63480E-6C03-439A-99F3-2BBCEC64D6A5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Econ, Pol &amp; Env Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5455CCD0-BA52-40F6-8DAE-1BA1063EE624</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>C11BDEA9-7D9D-4728-B6A9-31032921B328</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Newton</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
