The proposed application of SFCL is to limit the ever-increasing fault current level of the grid network due to the increasing capacity of newly integrated renewable energy, especially wind power. Compared to exiting technology, e.g. SFCL using 1st generation HTS, the proposed SFCL has the advantage of quick recovery and low AC loss, which is enabled by thorough understanding of the underlying HTS physics. 
 
The project has three phases. The initial physics study focuses on the quench development and propagation of HTS which is closely related to the performance of SFCL. Experimental and numerical methods will be employed in the study to explore how HTS reacts to applied currents which are higher than its critical current. The second phase focuses on the design of SFCL, optimized geometries will be identified, and the critical current and ac loss of the designs will be estimated by the modeling. The third phase is the integration simulation platform of grid system study with wind power, considering the real time reaction of SFCL. This simulation platform will serve as a strong tool to evaluate the SFCL performance under various system fault conditions.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>1.Knowledge and people
The knowledge of HTS physics we learn from this project, especially the quench mechanism, will pave the way of future application of HTS. The knowledge will be delivered to both academic and industrial societies by means of project collaboration, article publishing, and conference presentations. We already have good publication records and impacts on journals of both applied physics and superconductivity fields (Applied physics letters, journal of applied physics, superconductivity technology and science, IEEE applied superconductivity), future impacts will be expanded to journals of energy (Energy, IEEE Sustainable energy). It is not certain that at this stage whether the project can lead to patents about SFCL. However, efforts will be made towards this end. 

One post-doctoral researchers, and several 4th year undergraduates will be involved in the project with various contribution. The multidisciplinary study is a good opportunity to practise creative thinking and broaden their horizons. A fault current limiter workshop is in plan, collaborating with experts from applied superconductivity, and electrical engineering. The workshop aims at postgraduate students from EU countries, who are interested in the exploration of renewable energy, smart grid, and applied superconductivity. The superconductivity group of University of Cambridge has successfully organized a numerical modeling workshop of HTS (a workshop series with 2012 in Barcelona ) in 2011, a renewable energy summer school in 2012 (both based on Magdalene college). Both of the events offer import experience for organizing future events. 

2.society
The project is expected to have great society impacts. The success of the project will have strong international influence, because it deals with a world wide challenge. And by using cutting-edge technology to a solve world-wide challenge, the UK will demonstrate to the world, its determination and strength to play a leading role in renewable energy development. Although we cannot make decision for the policy maker about how much renewable power would be integrated into the grid in the coming years, one thing is for certain: the successful development of SFCL with high performance will pave the way for future grid with high penetration of wind power. 

In terms of pathways, initially, we will use media to internationally broadcast the launch of new funded SFCL project in the UK. During the project, we will update the progress of the project, using the means of academic papers, industrial news, interviews, and conferences. In the final test stage, we will spread our testing results to major national grids, wind manufacturers, and HTS manufacturers around the world. 



3.Economy
The potential beneficiaries in terms of economy will be the grid, wind power manufacturers, and HTS manufacturers. The installation of robust SFCL in the grid will save potential troubles for the grid companies: the old network and equipments may not need to upgrade in order to withstand increasing fault current level; the choice of locations for the wind farm would be more flexible. Commercialization of high-temperature superconductors is essential to promote the HTS industry, because the consumption of HTS conductors will drive down the price, which, in return, stimulates future application and commercialization. For wind turbine manufacturers, the solution of wind power integrating challenge will influence the policy of future wind penetration in an implicit way, and the grid operators will be more willing to accept wind power to the network.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>282013</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>One of the first models that attempted to describe the electro-thermal properties of a SFCL was introduced
by the research leader in 2002. This model was built in order to study the effects of inhomogeneities and
the occurrence of weak links (cracks) in superconducting bulks by assuming a 2D electrical circuit model
for thermally coupled SC grains, with independent E-J properties. In the framework of this project, Dr. Ruiz
has extended this model to a fully 3D electro-thermal model for considering more realistic scenarios with
different SC structures (bulks, thin films, and 2G HTS tapes) all into a graphic computational platform
developed in the programming language Delphi. This software, called SCLab (Superconducting Laboratory)
can run in WIN+97 platforms and beyond. It has not been tested in Windows 8 and forward. Further
advanced analysis tools developed in Matlab R2013a have been included. A comprehensive workbook
illustrating the purpose, motivation, and How to use, of the Delphi program and advanced tools is inclueded
together with the last Beta version of the SCLab platform.
The heat transfer properties imposed by the cryogenic bath, and a customizable library that allows the
users to include the intrinsic anisotropic properties of different materials for the designing of SFCLs are
included as advanced features of the SCLab platform. In particular, a more realistic boil-off curve for the
liquid nitrogen has been implemented into the software by defining a set of continuous equations that reduce
in average a wide spectrum of experimental measurements. This covers the regime of boiling nucleation
(70K - 91K), the stage of the transition boiling (91K - 106K), the mean of minimum heat flux (106K -
111K), and finally the regime of stable film boiling (111K - ).

A customizable materials library has been incorporated to the new software in order to
ease the modelling of cumbersome structures. It allows a fast designing and modelling of multilayered tapes
like 2G-HTS tapes, patterned structures made of superconductor/metal thin films, or the study of the effects
produced by structural anomalies such as impurities, cracks, or anisotropic defects, among other structures.
Specifically, in what concerns to the electrical parameters for the superconducting materials, the values for
critical current density Jc have been defined within the standard 1?V/cm electric field criterion along the abplanes
and the c-axis (for including anisotropic properties). The value for the exponent n in the E-J powerlaw
which describes the superconducting state of the most popular superconducting materials in the
prototyping of SFCL, i.e, YBaCuO (Y123) and BiSrCaCuO (Bi2212) has been included in the range of
interest (77K up to Tc). Then, the values for the resistivity of these materials after the transition from the
superconducting state to the normal state has been defined for temperatures higher than Tc. On the other
hand, and in order to achieve numerical results as realistic as possible, the nonlinear features of the thermal
conductivity as a function of the temperature for T &amp;gt; 77K, and the experimentally observed anisotropy along
the ab-planes and the c-axis has been considered in both directions. Accordingly to our knowledge, this is
the first time than an electro-thermal model allows to include the above mentioned anisotropy factors for
superconducting materials with the extensive range of temperatures required for the modelling of SFCLs. On
the other hand, the volumetric heat capacity with temperature dependence for the superconducting materials
has been also included in accordance with reported experimental measurements. Finally, the electrical
resistivity, thermal conductivity, and volumetric heat capacity of other materials used for the designing of
SFCL based upon 2G HTS conductors or other structures, like Copper, Gold, Silver, Stainless steel (316L),
Hastelloy C276, and Kapton have been included. Other materials can be directly included into the platform
by the user needs or in the adjunct table, providing great interface flexibility.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>they will be used in the power generation and supply industry</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>013D26A1-F8DB-4FCC-A887-C9D755A798A3</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54525feac1be53.26594180</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Energy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E5E0FDA7-733B-4717-929D-7EB85A6F54E4</gtr:id><gtr:title>Experimental Study of the Normal Zone Propagation Velocity in Double-Layer 2G-HTS Wires by Thermal and Electrical Methods</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/31ab01452b87d7a4d4d4cdbc1275741f"><gtr:id>31ab01452b87d7a4d4d4cdbc1275741f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Zhong Z</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56cadde5c96db6.89701659</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>51C7E4E0-6907-4715-9588-B6491EEDA8C7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Resistive-Type Superconducting Fault Current Limiters: Concepts, Materials, and Numerical Modeling</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/71c1e74faa71243bbe1ce8b6ea2b61cb"><gtr:id>71c1e74faa71243bbe1ce8b6ea2b61cb</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ruiz H</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56cadde4eb0389.62357052</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A013FADC-E99F-4445-A0BE-3F22BD77FBEB</gtr:id><gtr:title>Optimal location and minimum number of superconducting fault current limiters for the protection of power grids</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>International Journal of Electrical Power &amp;
