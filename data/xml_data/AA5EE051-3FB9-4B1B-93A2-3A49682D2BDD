In doing this, the series is designed to engage with wider debates around political disengagement, the character of political agency and the impact of so-called single issue and identity politics on movements for social change. In our present moment of multiple crises, these questions of political agency and participation have become heightened, most of all in relation to a younger generation whose life choices and chances are being curtailed by the impact of austerity, economic crises, political unrest, scarce ecological resources and, for some, continuing militarization of everyday life.

Recent critiques of fundamentalism and exclusionary nationalisms have pointed to the role of ethnic mobilisation in creating divisions and hatreds. However, there are other histories of ethnic mobilisation that are not based on such exclusionary logics. Some of these movements have played an integral role in wider movements for social justice and change. This series examines the contexts that have enabled mobilisations around 'race', ethnicity, or, in some circumstances, religion to become a component of or catalyst for wider struggles for social justice.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>User - Trade unions

- share political histories across movements and locations;
- preserve and share subordinated intellectual histories;
- locate practices of state racism within a wider context of economic crisis.

The series ended with a major two-day international conference held at the University of East London in January 2017. This series brought together scholars in the area of racism studies across the UK and included high profile international speakers.

The events of the series form the basis of a series of publications, all in process at present. These include:

- an edited collection to be published in the book series Racism and Resistance by Manchester University Press;
- special issue of the journal 'Social Identities', on the black radical tradition and antiracist struggles;
- a planned special issue of Ethnic and Racial Studies on racialised violences, this proposal is being completed at present.

In addition, the project has produced a teaching pack for use in schools and youth groups and this will be distributed in hard copy and will be available via our websites.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We will produce materials to make our findings available to wider audiences for our final conference in January 2017.

The teaching pack is designed for use by a wider audience and 1500 copies have been produced. We will seek to gather the impact of this initiative through an online questionnaire for teachers.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A745F638-5E38-4873-8C31-CAB408DBC50E</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e36a9c110b16.70055003</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/M002837/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FC4405D9-8A0D-41F9-B71A-A19C9CD0AEFA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ethnicity</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5455CCD0-BA52-40F6-8DAE-1BA1063EE624</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5BAFFA07-4055-4FE0-BE2D-FF47ECC4B6BF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Politics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
