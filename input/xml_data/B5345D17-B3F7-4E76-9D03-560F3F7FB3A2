However, a number of stakeholders have claimed that the current regulatory requirements for approving new medicines on to the market do not produce the kind of robust evidence needed by health technology assessment (HTA) bodies to inform reimbursement decisions. This may lead to flawed decision-making, missed opportunities for maximising health gains offered by alternative treatments and sub-optimal treatment of individual patients. Combining a quantitative survey approach with qualitative case study analyses of a selection of drug products evaluated by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, the researcher will explore the technical, philosophical, and socio-political factors which shape the ways in which NICE deals with a range of uncertainties and gaps in the evidence base for new drugs.&lt;/p>

The proposed research seeks to investigate whether, and to what extent, Health Technology Assessment (HTA) bodies are able to meet this goal given current weaknesses and gaps in the evidence base for new drugs. In addition, the research engages directly with the current policy context by investigating the extent to which various initiatives and proposals meet the needs of different stakeholder groups. Consequently, the research is highly relevant and timely, and has the potential to inform policy at a time when several private and public sector initiatives to increase collaboration between HTA bodies and the supranational European drug licensing agency are being pursued. The research will be of interest to and directly benefit the following groups of stakeholders:

UK Government and Public Sector bodies. 
Findings from the proposed research of potential obstacles to robust HTA appraisal of new drugs have the potential to inform current policy debate about the future role of NICE, HTA and value-based pricing in the UK. It will therefore benefit policy-makers in the Department of Health, the NHS's National Institute for Health Research, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, and GPs as future commissioners of health care.

Supranational Institutions of the EU. 
Research on the relationship between market authorisation and licensing, and on emerging EU-level policy initiatives is highly relevant to current policy debates and will benefit the EU Commission, which is actively supporting the development of HTA across Member States, and in particular the Directorate Generals for Health &amp;amp; Consumers and Enterprise &amp;amp; Industry which, through the Pharmaceutical Forum, have addressed reimbursement and relative effectiveness as priority issues. The proposed research is directly relevant to the question of what evidence is needed for HTA bodies to determine the relative effectiveness of new drug products and will therefore be of benefit to these EU bodies. The research will also be of interest to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) which has become involved in collaborative pilot projects with HTA bodies to provide joint advice to pharmaceutical companies developing new products in select therapeutic areas.

Private Sector. 
The pharmaceutical industry is concerned that the spread of national and regional HTA bodies within Member States of the EU presents a &amp;quot;fourth hurdle&amp;quot; to market access and increases the evidential requirements (and thus the development costs) for new drugs. Some companies increasingly favour standardisation of the evidence required by HTA bodies and the EMA. The research is directly pertinent to this issue and will be of interest to industry generally, and in particular to The European Healthcare Innovative Leadership Network (EHILN) - an industry initiative to bring together representatives of pharmaceutical companies, patient groups, HTA bodies and drug licensing authorities to consider how companies can demonstrate the value of their drugs. 

Third Sector Organisations. 
Finally, the research will be of interest to patient groups within the UK and EU, who have expressed concerns about access to medicines and the quality of evidence to inform treatment decisions, and to consumer health organisations with an interest in the rational use of medicines such as Health Action International, Prescrire International and the Medicines in Europe Forum. The research will also be of interest to professional associations such as HTA International, EUnetHTA and the European Public Health Association and to health advisory/ research bodies and networks such as the James Lind Alliance and WHO Europe's European Observatory on Health Systems and Services.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>187216</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>European Public Health Association (EUPHA)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>European Union (EU)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Trans-Atlantic Network for Access to Safe and Effective Medicines</gtr:description><gtr:id>50834FB5-3AFF-4390-B61E-84BAC17F935F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>doi: https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.i4437 - political sociology, epidemiology, medicine, public health</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ca7d9ea6efa1.73651933-2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>All partners have participated in the related workshops and conferences.

This letter was published on the website of the EMA along with the EMA's response. partly as a consequence of this letter, a public workshop was held to discuss results of the EMA's Adaptive Pathways Pilot project.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ca87f02b6980.02006335</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Third sector organisations</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Symposium on Health Technology Assessment in the EU</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C0E0C455-958D-488C-B70F-AB4D1341E96A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was a symposium to discuss the future of health technology assessment in the EU, and in particular collaboration between the European Medicines Agency and national HTA bodies. It was attended by over 200 policy makers, regulators, health economists, consumer and patient groups, expert scientists and clinicians. The session in which I was involved discussed the merits of initiating and organizing an Early Dialogue between relevant regulatory bodies, HTA bodies and companies developing health products. Furthermore, the possible involvement of other relevant stakeholders in the process was also be addressed.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ca836b872228.82389069</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.has-sante.fr/portail/jcms/c_2055829/en/forum-has-health-technology-assessment-sans-frontieres-paris-30-october-2015</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Interview on BMJ Talk Medicine 16 August 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>A broadcast e.g. TV/radio/film/podcast (other than news/press)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F21918A9-C3DD-446E-B3CA-5A0E506ED673</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was an interview with the British Medical Journal, for 'Talk Medicine', on the 16 August 2016, discussing an Analysis piece first authored by the PI, and published in the BMJ.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ca9ee7739e63.25576181</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.bmj.com/content/354/bmj.i4437</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Symposium on Access to Medicines In Europe</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>17AFC563-E863-4C35-8953-89F3CC3E6663</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Over 100 participants attended this two-day conference in Brussels on 29-30 November 2016, jointly organised by EPHA and the Polish Permanent Representation to the EU.
