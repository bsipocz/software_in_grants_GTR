&lt;p>Through a series of international workshops, it harnesses the strength in pedagogy and research from countries with a much stronger quantitative tradition such as the United States of America, the Netherlands and Belgium. It aims to disseminate good practice in quantitative teaching as well as to encourage the use of quantitative materials in substantive modules across and at each level of our undergraduate curriculum. In doing so it seeks to promote a culture of producing and embedding high quality quantitative research through problem-based learning.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>These objectives encompass the development of pedagogic activities for all UK social sciences teachers, from junior lecturers to professors. It is the first attempt of an international pedagogic collaboration in quantitative teaching in the UK.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This international workshop series will be hosted across the UK covering both quantitative methods teaching and teaching substantive sociology/social sciences modules with quantitative research. There will be four two-day workshops with a final one-day closing conference over 18 months, with a dedicated website on which participants can share ideas and materials.&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We are confident that our workshop series will act as a catalyst in raising interest and awareness in QM teaching in the UK social science community. We expect the passion and commitment of our experts in 'mainstreaming' QM in social sciences will enthuse our participants who will then cascade this positive and healthy attitude towards QM to our undergraduate students. As detailed in the 'Pathway to Impact' attachment, our extensive network means that our regional focus in Wales does not preclude national and international participation of this inititative. The impact and visibility of our work is therefore wide ranging and sustainable through continuous collaborative efforts. Other short, medium and long term impact includes the development of an online community of QM and non-QM teachers; the promotion of international collaborative links in QM pedagogy; and the development of a core set of QM skills in undergraduates in social sciences curriculum.

The embedded web-forum we created would provide the focus for debates about QM pedagogy raised in the workshops. Our website will also host videos of master classes, in addition to the wide range of materials and teaching resources produced throughout the course of this series. The website will continue to host these activities after the project funding has ended and will be supported by the School of Social Science at Cardiff University.As well as using high-profile speakers to raise to issue of teaching QM we intend to capitalise on the engagement with the international community through the development of further collaboration. Future collaborative links with institutions outside of the UK will be sought and we anticipate a wide array of exchange activities to follow, e.g. visiting lectureships, hosting research students, postdoc researchers, undergraduate exchange programmes and short-term sabbaticals and international pedagogical placements. 

Inevitably the workshops will explicitly explore how a set of core QM skills can be integrated and taught across undergraduate curriculums in UK HEIs. Implicitly this may mean that, through providing a forum for UK academics to identifying and developing common links between substantive areas and institutions, we also start to identify a common set of core QM skills for the UG curriculum across UK social science. Whilst the substantive areas will differ in topics, we may begin to reach a consensus over the level of generic QM knowledge undergraduates will be expected to achieve at each stage of their degree. Currently there is wide variation in what is covered in research method modules and very little communication between institutions (even between disciplines in the same institutions). This will provide a step change towards an agreed set of core QM skills that would enable the pooling together of common resources. This will also mean we are a step closer to establishing a national benchmark in QM capacity for all social science gradautes, increasing employability and signalling to potential employers what they can expect from social science graduates.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>76530</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>BSc Social Analytics Pilot QCF level 3</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AE3534AE-D980-4A47-97E1-639986BEBFEB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Following our RDI training model, at the 24 Sept launch event, the team introduced the world of quantitative analysis, in a social context to over 50 school students.

Our RDI workshop series has continued to reach a broad range of existing and potential quantitative methods teachers in social science subjects across universities in the UK, with a particular focus on advanced PhD students and early career researchers/HE teachers. 

This project had significant national impact, as evidenced by the following:

? 73 QM teachers and stakeholders attended at least one of the five events.

? 27 early career researchers and advanced PhD students took part in more than one workshop.

? 11 RDI participants presented at one or more of the workshops and in the final closing conference.

? This RDI has an extensive institutional reach across the four nations in the UK and provided training for QM teachers and early career researchers in 31 higher education institutions. 

? Our QUANT@C (Quantitative Methods Teaching @Cardiff) has 3939 page views from 43 countries across the globe (16 European, 11 African and 9 Asian/Middle Eastern countries). The average page view time was 213 seconds and 123 seconds for all RDI events.

? Observations and discussion on curriculum design fed directly into our (successful) Q-Step and continue to inform the new programme we are developing at Cardiff (BSc Social Analytics)

Three Q-Step lecturers from Cardiff were awarded funding within Cardiff University and Cardiff Q-Step Centre to visit the Department of Statistics and COMPASS (Centre of Methods and Policy Application in the Social Sciences) at the University of Auckland in December 2016. The purpose of this trip was to exchange good practice in quantitative pedagogy and embedding quantitative methods in substantive social science teaching and learning for both undergraduate and further education students.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2017</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>06D18349-67B8-4B24-B37D-366269D8F1D8</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545fe407765b00.84622455</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Drawing on the expertise in quantitative training and research in North America and Europe, our Researcher Development Initiative (RDI) had organised three national workshops providing training in teaching quantitative methods in social sciences.

In order to maximum our reach to all HEIs nationally, we rotate our workshops in different parts of the country: Manchester, Birmingham, London and Cardiff.
Further work by the Cardiff Q-Step Centre in developing new ways of teaching QM in social sciences has been widely practised by both early career lecturers as well as graduate teaching assistants within the School of Social Sciences at Cardiff University.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our aim is to increase the number of competent and confident social science teachers in higher education in the UK for our undergraduate students.
