These were identified on the basis of their morphology, because, at the time of their isolation, molecular methods were not available. The group from which these micro-organisms come is now known to make the products observed in these isolates and also to make an unusually large number of other products of considerable potential. 

Legal and market information is now required to clarify how best to take forward the exploitation of these isolates and for that reason a Pathfinder award is sought. If successful, the following work will be undertaken: 

Legal information: The patent landscape for this group is complex and is growing fast. It is therefore essential that a detailed analysis is undertaken of this and funding is requested for an assessment by an independent patent specialist or firm. The specification for the tender for this analysis will be developed in detailed consultation with the University's Technology Transfer Office (Research and Enterprise Services (RES)) using their considerable experience of similar investigations. Knowledge that there is a detailed understanding of the patent position will also strengthen the subsequent business case. 

Market analysis: An independent analysis of potential markets for the known and likely products will also be competitively commissioned from independent experts, again drawing on the experience of RES. Based on, amongst other things, the size of potential markets, the market drivers and the competitive position (key players and existing products), this will identify niche sectors, where the micro-organisms' products have the greatest potential. The analysis will also identify any barriers to market entry over and above any emerging from the patent analysis. Information on recent investments in the identified niches will also inform the on-going search for commercial partners and investors . 

Some external funding has already been obtained for work on these micro-organisms and conversations have begun with other commercial and independent funders. Working with RES, further partners and funders will be approached confidentially during the Pathfinder, if successful, and their views, interests and needs will also inform the development of a full Follow-On Proposal. 

RES will work with the applicant to produce the best focus for a full Follow-On proposal, using information from the patent and market analyses and potential sponsors. This is likely to have one or two product areas as its initial focus.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-06-16</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>15898</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Centre For Environment, Fisheries And Aquaculture Science</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Co-working with the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (CEFAS) Weymouth Laboratory</gtr:description><gtr:id>EC511D4A-E957-484C-B5C3-55F2D7CBB017</gtr:id><gtr:impact>See confidential summary in other outputs and knowledge section.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b98892262655.40744837-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>This project could not have been developed without the support of colleagues at CEFAS Weymouth, who allowed me to lodge the micro-organisms, which are the subject of this study, at the laboratory with them for many years, assisted with maintaining them in culture and provided initial expertise in how to develop them for exploitation.
In 2016, CEFAS colleagues have provided expertise and world-class light and electron microscopes to allow detailed anatomical descriptions of the organisms to be made. These are essential for the patent in development.
My back-up collection still continues to be lodged at CEFAS Weymouth for security.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The project, which this award supported, was conceived and is led by myself. It involves micro-organisms isolated during my SERC-funded PhD @(1975-78) and my NERC Individual Postdoctoral Fellowship (1980-82).
Since my move to Heriot-Watt, a growing number of colleagues have become involved, forming the nucleus of a research team. I have now raised the funding for two PhD studentships to assist me in gathering the information required to begin the exploitation of these micro-organisms.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>30000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>Global</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Direct Application to Commercial Company</gtr:description><gtr:end>2019-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Syngenta</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>BC1C8DE2-6BF0-4AD8-98AC-EBA3F7D69E81</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58b97e97cea478.36287106</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-09-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The market assessment commissioned as part of this award has been released (following some small redactions) to support the case for a pilot scale plant for evaluating marine micro-algal products to be sited at the Scottish Association for Marine Science Laboratories at Dunstaffnage.
