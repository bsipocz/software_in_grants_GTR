In association with Digitales. Also available as DVD. Description: 'Tales from Camp' is a collection of short films produced as the result of a year-long collaboration between Salford Lads Club and Goldsmiths College, University of London. The project centred on a multi-layered digital storytelling process to coincide with the celebrations of the Salford Lads Club's 100th annual camping holiday to Wales in 2011. While the club's long history of camping in Wales had been well documented by still and moving film footage, this material had begun to deteriorate and become disorganised over the years. This situation raised the need to digitally preserve this rare amateur archive, but also presented an opportunity to experiment with the creative possibilities of widening interaction with it. In producing the Tales from Camp films, Club members of all ages were supported to undertake a group exchange of stories about their memories from attending the camp, record their own 'tales from camp' and then illustrate them with edited, remixed and recombined archival footage using basic movie making software.</gtr:description><gtr:id>4580AF33-D509-4667-A2D2-E25D6160C98E</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-6987750229.414329c9b998e</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Tales from Camp film series [GOLD; SLC]</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2012</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Oasis Academy MediaCityUK</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Oasis Academy MediaCityUK [GOLD; OAS]</gtr:description><gtr:id>6DC29CF6-A9B5-4132-AB64-C5DE86B79816</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b970f33cb970f350-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>Oasis Academy MediaCityUK is a secondary education institution that relocated from Ordsall to a brand new complex in Salford Quays in September 2012. Storycircle?s research with Oasis Academy MediaCityUK has focused on the use of digital technologies and the creation of interactive web-based maps to enable a school to explore and understand its current and historical relationship to the neighbourhood in which it is located. The research has taken place in two distinct phases over a period in which the secondary school, previously Hope High, has relocated to new premises close to MediaCityUK. In the first phase Storycircle trained learners and staff at the school in the use of Historypin, a map-based platform in which users embed photos and narratives, and supported the school to engage the local community through public digital storytelling events. In the second phase Storycircle developed an innovative method of engaging with the biographies of individuals commemorated on war memorials. In collaboration with a local interest group dedicated to the preservation of Salford war memorials (SWARM) students at the school were supported to research and record short biographical narratives, which were uploaded to a blog, and located onto historic maps of the area. The war memorial project coincided with the rededication of a World War 1 memorial recovered from the church mission building demolished to make way for the new school. 


Collaborative action research with organisational, institutional and industry partners working in the digital economy is at the core of the Storycircle approach. These collaborations work through an iterative process of analysis by the Storycircle research team and reflection by the collaborative partner. The range of outcomes and outputs brought about through each collaboration are cross-referenced in ROS using square brackets e.g. [GOLD; PVM; SLC].</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Salford Museum and Art Gallery</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>The Future Galleries Consortia (Salford THINKlab)</gtr:description><gtr:id>63E69C5F-6D13-4DAB-952A-345AE91C9D4D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b9d5a3ccb9d5a3ea-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>The Future Galleries Consortia was established to collaborate with the University of Salford THINKlab to define a research strategy for enhancing engagement and dialogue between the cultural organisations and their audience. 

This new partnership has so far attracted more than 20 members from museums, art galleries and libraries in the Northwest region. These are: Touchstones Rochdale, Gallery Oldham and Oldham MBC Heritage Services, The John Rylands Library, GMP Museum, Manchester Libraries, Information &amp;amp; Archives, Bolton Museum, Working Class Movement Library, Ordsall Hall &amp;amp; Salford Museum &amp;amp; Gallery, University of Salford Development and Events, Manchester Art Gallery, Manchester City Galleries, Bolton Library and Museum Service, Garstang Museum and Liverpool University, Museum of Science and Industry, Museum of Wigan Life, Cornerhouse, Manchester Museum/Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester United, Tate Gallery, BBC Learning, NML/Lancaster Maritime, The Lowry, People?s History Museum, Salford Museum &amp;amp; Art Gallery. Moreover, a number of schools from the University of Salford also joined the consortia to contribute to discussions; these include in addition to the School of the Built Environment, The School of Computing Science and Engineering and the School of Humanities, Languages &amp;amp; Social Sciences. 



The following outcome has emerged as a result of the activities of this consortia: 

* Greater understanding of the nature of the audience and how digital technology can enhance their engagement.

* Two digital prototypes (based on Microsoft table and gaming technology with body tracking) that demonstrate novel use of digital technology within museums. 

* Concept design of narrative environments that can engage audiences in contributing their knowledge to existing materials.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Swinton and Pendlebury Local History Society</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Swinton and Pendlebury Local History Society [GOLD]</gtr:description><gtr:id>A5F1BBAA-2709-4A40-B49D-67558B891C4D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b973e0e2b973e100-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>During the pilot phase of Storycicle from April to September 2010 Storycircle collaborated with Swinton and Pendlebury Local History Society by facilitating an initial digital storytelling workshop with its members resulting in a collection of short videos narrated and edited by the participants, a selection of which were showcased at two public events at the Salford Lads and Girls Club and the Imperial War Museum North.

The Storycircle team have undertaken an intensive 18-month action research project with PVM, initially orientated towards helping PVM to better sustain their networks of reporters as a ?Community of Practice? (after Lave &amp;amp;Wenger 1991), and strengthening PVM?s curatorial role in the ways content produced by their Community Reporters might be publically presented. Later phases of the research then focused on developing their use of digital and internet tools in the ?Community Reporter? programme. In particular, the Storycircle team designed and implemented a system of ?social analytics? to evaluate and demonstrate the CR programme?s effectiveness. At the core of this approach is a process of organisational reflexivity. The work has involved:

? Identifying collaboratively a series of five core intended outcomes for its Community Reporters programme 

? Co-designing an innovative social analytics framework in which both analytics measures and tools for evaluating offline activity are explicitly linked to intended outcomes.

? Co-designing and implementing a series of ?content curation? experiments in order to enhance public engagement community reported content online

? Proposing a range of further web analytic tools and methods with evaluation of their application to be carried out over time.

Collaborative action research with organisational, institutional and industry partners working in the digital economy is at the core of the Storycircle approach. These collaborations work through an iterative process of analysis by the Storycircle research team and reflection by the collaborative partner.

These Vouchers were advertised on the FIRM website, via a TSB Knowledge Transfer Partnership event in September 2012, and a joint Salford/Lancaster Brunch Bytes workshop at MediaCityUK in November 2012. 



Experimental video production company, AlbinoMosquito, was successful in securing one of these &amp;pound;5000 awards to develop prototype applications for an EEG brainwave headset. The company prototyped two iPad apps which would allow users of the Nuerosky Headsets to play games and to experience media, influenced by the brain activity picked up by the headset. The prototype was toured at the w00t festival in Copenhagen in May 2013.



The company is now working with FIRM partners THINKlab to bid collaboratively for further research and development funds from NESTA and TSB.



An video which trials the development of a art installation based on the headset technology is hosted on the AlbinoMosquito website here: http://www.albinomosquito.com/2013/06/scanners-teaser/


This project reprogrammed an EEG brainwave headset (specifically the Mindwave device from Nuerosky) to develop new ways of environmental, behavioural and emotional interaction.

Representation at Management Board as well as a collaborator. The University of Salford has collaborated on a project with the BBC to explore and develop a practical toolset enabling research into user experience/ HCI issues surrounding the ?Internet of Things?. Three research staff were employed by the University of Salford and housed within BBC R&amp;amp;D department.



The Internet of Things (IoT) concerns embedding digital behaviour into everyday objects, and giving them networking technology and a digital presence. The work aims to explore how IoT connected physical objects can deliver more valuable experiences than screen based interactions. The research focused on prototyping a connected fob for real-time interaction with BBC radio content. 



Radio has an implicitly active audience. It has natural advantages in that it?s live, personal and mobile, with strengths in the live experience, connectivity and topicality. However experiences with radio whilst driving are exclusively a one way deal, 21 million people each week* listen to the BBC in their vehicles, but can?t easily interact with their favourite station. *[RAJAR Q1]



The prototype attempts a solution to this problem. The project built a demonstration of a simple one-squeeze interaction that triggers a series of web-based tagging events to populate a bookmark-list of tagged moments for radio providing at the very moment the ability to identify a track and save it for later. The listener has an immediate skimmable or ?eyes-free? interaction at their fingertips. Further information on this can be found at the BBC R&amp;amp;D blog: http://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/blog/2013/06/radiotag-fob-human-scale-connected-objects


The project employed 3 researchers to investigate how the 'internet of things' could deliver a more valuable experience leading to the prototype of a connected FOB for real time interaction with BBC radio content.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Salford City Council</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Secret Gardens Festival of Mass Narrative [SGF; FIRM]</gtr:description><gtr:id>E9F7682A-01D2-44FE-BC58-37BC54D287B7</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b970ce8eb970cea2-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>The aims of the Festival are to explore the potential of advanced technologies and design cross-platform solutions that will embed enabling technologies available to all in the process of sharing cultural programming and facilitating mass participation.

Each phase was negotiated, developed and co-designed in collaboration with study participants (staff, students, managers). Phase 1 was exploratory. Using storytelling workshops, observations and interviews with college leaders, staff and students, this phase generated dialogue around existing social and digital infrastructures. Desired outcomes for narrative exchange identified here were (1) a public-facing storytelling event; (2) a website showcase linking students? (digital) content to curricular-related project briefs; and (3) the integration of social media with college activities, with training workshops for staff and students. In Phase 2, constraints identified in Phase 1 led to a study re-design that focused on Twitter and a Twitter event linked to the launch of a new college radio station in which college Wi-Fi network was experimentally opened up to students? mobile phones for the first time and digital screens around the dining-hall were used to display student tweets in real-time. Towards the end of Phase 2, students were invited to participate in a broader exchange linked to a local arts festival based on storytelling. This was continued into Phase 3 with two strands of activity one with art and design students augmenting an on-site exhibition with QR-codes linked to web-hosted audio narratives and the other exploring web-based image archiving.

Initial exploratory work focused on developing an innovative idea that tenant representatives had for reimagining the historic practice of town twinning as a process of digitally enabled knowledge exchange linking twinned tower block neighbourhoods in different countries. The twinning idea was explored through visits and meeting with tenant representatives of a high rise in Southeast London, in meetings with senior officers at Salford City Council and through presentations to the Salford twinning association. Supported by Storycircle and University of Salford, tenants from the Islington estate have led the City of Salford?s participation in Re-Block, an EU-URBACT transnational thematic network of 10 city partners focused on reviving high rise neighbourhoods and social cohesion. In phase 2, following consultation with individual tenants, Storycircle have used the opportunity presented by the 50th anniversary of the two tower blocks and a planned Jubilee celebration on the estate to research the relationship between digitally mediated storytelling, place and belonging. Using flexible methods of story gathering and engagement tenants and residents, community workers, housing officers and elected representatives with a relationship to area and its local history of regeneration were invited to participate by contributing stories, photos and other documents to an online collection. The multimedia collection of stories will be accessible on a newly designed platform for exhibiting and archiving community narratives developed in collaboration with academic partners at Salford University ThinkLab.

In 2012 BT officially joined the FIRM consortium with representation at Management Board and Project Executive level. An opportunity to initiate a tangible research project around sports broadcasting was identified, with a researcher employed at the University of Salford. The HyperlocalTV project was built around BT Vision's desire to add value to their sports broadcasting packages, with a focus on how this may be applied to local sports events. The six month intensive research period involved defining 'hyperlocal' and a process of creating and auditioning hyperlocal sports content. We opted to approach a local, professional rugby union team in light of BT Vision?s &amp;pound;152m four-year rights deal to broadcast Aviva Premiership matches from the 2013-14 season. Differentiation in this fiercely competitive arena is a challenge, however, the addition of ?hyperlocal? content, specifically sports based is a potentially rewarding prospect. The customer preference for bundled media packages including TV, phone and broadband lends itself well to the hyperlocal paradigm with geo-located connected devices within and external to the home. Of particular interest is the introduction of internet connected set top boxes providing video on demand (VOD), personalised and location aware programming. 



The resulting report outlines findings to propose a hyperlocal sports solution in relation to the current TV offerings and is available at:

BT Vision?s desire was to add value to their spots broadcasting packages. The project approached a local professional rugby union team to test the idea of hyperlocal content whereby fans and supporters through mobile technology can become part of the broadcast experience.

The Secret Gardens Festival of Mass Narrative and Start?s interest in marking the first anniversary of its community growing space in Buile Hill Park presented an opportunity for Storycircle to continue its collaboration with the organisation in 2012. Four digital storytelling workshops were conducted across two phases with two groups of Start clients (a gardening group and a creative writing group) to create and record a short audio story around the festival?s theme of cherished spaces. The collection of audio stories were then uploaded to a blog and onto interactive tables during the digital showcase of the Secret Gardens Festival at MediaCityUK in June 2012.

Collaborative action research with organisational, institutional and industry partners working in the digital economy is at the core of the Storycircle approach. These collaborations work through an iterative process of analysis by the Storycircle research team and reflection by the collaborative partner.

Crucially, the ritualised camp practices included documentary film (from 1937) and photography captured over much of this time, producing a rare archival record of this shared experience. In 2011, the arrival of the one hundredth annual camping trip was taken as an opportunity to celebrate and reflect on its importance in sustaining the wider role that the club has played within the community. The centrepiece of this celebration was the production of a permanent exhibition at the club called 'One Hundred Camps', which consisted of a collection of framed images relating to every year that the club went on camp. This exhibition emerged out of this moment of collective reflection, and built upon a year-long collaboration between the Club and the Storycircle team on the 'Tales from Camp' films. This exhibition was timed to coincide with the Secret Gardens Festival of Mass Narrative (led by Prof Paul Hayward). The '100 Camps' images and 'Tales from Camp' films have subsequently featured in a range of other contexts, including the temporary exhibition at the Royal Geographical Society Annual Conference in Edinburgh, the BBC 'big screens' in the Manchester Arndale Centre and the MediaCityUK site on Salford Quays, on screens inside the Salford Quays shuttle buses, as well as being available to view online.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-5045637632.7626760bf9301e</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>SME Assistance via Focus innovation</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:id>34B51E32-6F28-4F1E-84EF-377706918D20</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Throughout FIRM there has been a willingness to engage with SMEs.

The Storycircle, Storysphere, and Salford Lads Club 'triangle' has proven to be a success that weaves the empowering narrative principle, creative community video storytelling and waves of user experiments.



This particular user engagement front has been a continuation of the work with Salford Lads Club and the Lancaster Storisphere team has made a number of trips to the club to meet with the participants, help to train them in using Storiboard and to collect video data that we have then uploaded for them. (This latter activity has been necessary because of the limited bandwidth at the club.) The initial phase led to one of the club members putting together a short video about ball games at the club over the years. Although quite short, this has provided some interesting feedback. For example, the person in question was essentially shown how to use the Storiboard interface once and was immediately able to start putting clips together - suggesting that the application really does deliver in terms of ease of use. Perhaps more interesting, though, was the process of him talking us though the clips he had used - which we captured on camera. This helped to confirm that the notion of a &amp;quot;moving photo album&amp;quot; is a powerful metaphor for story created in Storisphere. The next phase of this case study is underway - with club participants having just been away to their annual camp where, we hope, they managed to captures lots of video which will be used to create a story about the camp.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-1941252939.34834460ca2519e</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Start in Salford Secret Gardens Blog [GOLD]</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1AC09E22-C12E-4A6B-B37F-63B316CE6AAB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Start in Salford produced a series of audio stories around the theme of cherished and valued places for the Secret Gardens Festival in June 2012.

Our principal collaborations have been with Salford City College, People's Voice Media, Salford Lads Club, Oasis Academy and The Islington Estate Tenants and Residents Association. In addition, we have had looser collaborations with Start in Salford, Salford Community Media Partnership, Swinton and Pendlebury Local Historical Society and the Salford Quays Participatory Group. Potential collaborations have been explored with many additional organizations in the region during the initial planning phase of our research involving over fifty exploratory meetings with civil society organisations, health care trusts, community arts groups, charities, museums and libraries and educational institutions. These exploratory meetings have subsequently enhanced the capacity of our project to foster connections between individuals and organisations within the region. 
.

We have worked in a collaborative way with a number of organizations in the area of MediaCityUK in Salford. Our aim throughout has been to explore how digital tools, and new infrastructures for producing, exchanging and archiving digital content, make a difference to supporting the production of stories and the exchanging of stories. Our wider aim has been to trace how, through such processes of facilitating story and story exchange, wider processes of mutual recognition and common value can be generated, with potential benefits for local civil society, local community and democratic process. 



The highlights of our collaborative approach include the following. We have extended existing digital storytelling methodologies based on face-to-face workshops lasting over several days by developing methods for supporting our partners to initiate dynamic and continuous processes of narrative production. Based on the needs and interests of each of our partners we have designed flexible practical interventions that focus on building the digital skills and capacities that are necessary for embedding in the routines and practices of our partners, new technologies for producing and exchanging stories (or enhancing the use of existing ones). We have experimented with a broad range of widely available digital tools, technologies and platforms. These tools have included low-cost technologies for recording audio and video, open-source video editing software, social media platforms (Twitter, Historypin), web analytic tools, QR-codes and mobile internet, blogs and open source content management systems (Wordpress and Drupal). We have developed methods for inclusive, participatory web-design leading to website development customising our approach to our partners needs in two contrasting contexts: a youth club [SLC] and a social enterprise developing a nationwide infrastructure for community reporting [PVM]. We have gathered survey data on social media and mobile technologies among 16-18 year old students in further education to inform the ongoing transformations in digital practice at a large further education college. In addition to mentoring and supporting key individuals necessary to the adoption of new tools and processes we have identified and developed methods of collaborative reflection suitable for each partner and context through regular informal feedback, structured workshops, interviews, focus groups and formal reporting. 
.

Beneficiaries: All Storycircle collaborative partner projects and their related constituencies.

Contribution Method: The research contributed to advancing action research approaches in the following key respects.



1. We have pioneered processes for embedding evaluation and reflection on the efficacy of digital agency within the action research cycle, utilising data and metrics intrinsic to the digital domain: social analytics.



2. Our approach to action research is innovative in terms of both the range and depth of our collaborations. We have engaged in sustained cycles of practice-based intervention, analysis and reflection in community-based settings, social enterprises and educational institutions. We have made it an explicit priority to facilitate participation from multiple and diverse constituencies within each of these contexts. Action research conceived on this basis operates with highly context-sensitive conceptions of social innovation. The breadth of our collaborations has helped us to perform an important brokering role, facilitating interaction between individuals, groups and organisations within the area that have been connected through us. 



3. We have consistently planned for and anticipated the long-term benefits and sustainability of our action research interventions. Our pedagogical practice and processes of analysis and reflection leading to enhanced digital agency have prioritised the development of toolkits and models for sustaining practice in digital narrative production and exchange beyond the lifetime of our project.



4. All the above achievements have been predicated on funding for a genuinely multi-disciplinary, agile and responsive research team with a broad portfolio of digital skills, professional experience and disciplinary knowledge and expertise (cultural geography, media sociology, digital culture, educational sociology, political sociology, film and visual culture), all working around core values: digital storytelling principles applied to help meet the actual needs of actual communities.

Our work builds from the 'story circle' concept developed by the international digital storytelling movement (Lambert 2007). Originally this referred to the physical circle in which storytellers sat to talk about and listen to accounts of potential digital stories. We have aimed to ask: what would a storycircle look like if its principles of mutual respect and exchange were translated to the wider digital infrastructure in which stories can now be produced, exchanged and stored. We call this a 'digital storycircle'. This leads in our research to a wider question: how can such a 'digital storycircle, as explored with particular partners, suggest ways forward for re

newing democratic culture?



The relationship between digital storytelling and democratic culture has been explored through our understanding of the contribution that digital resources make to developing and sustaining civic culture. Our work has also been done in the particular context of Media CityUK. Local communities have been impacted both positively and negatively by the proximity of MediaCityUK, and are looking for ways to meaningfully engage with such developments. Primary MCUK stakeholders are also keen that local communities can find ways to do this. Community engagement has been a priority. Our research has taken steps to facilitate and then sustain these meaningful forms of interaction, exchange and engagement within this wider context. Storytelling workshops with all our research partners have supported their contribution to cultural activities, exhibitions, festivals and open days, held at MediaCityUK and hosted by the development's major stakeholders. 



In each of our collaborations with educational, civic and social organisations we have supported and advanced the use of digital technologies among pre-existing communities for the purposes of civic dialogue, debate and knowledge production focused on matters of common concern. 




.

All our fieldwork has been developed collaboratively with local partners and has focused around the core act of storytelling, story production and story exchange. We have done this within a wider perspective that frames all our work: that when people are recognised, and recognise each other as having stories to tell based on their life experience, this is a key way of recognising them as human beings, with significant benefits for wider individual and social wellbeing.

Beneficiaries: All Storycircle research collaborations: Salford Lads Club [SLC]; Salford City College [SCC]; People's Voice Media [PVM]; The Islington Estate Tennents and Residents Association [TT]; Oasis Academy MediaCityUk [OMC]; Start in Salford [Start]

Contribution Method: In each research collaboration we have facilitated the development and enhancement of mediated spaces of exchange and civic dialogue both within our partner's diverse constituencies and beyond them. 



We have done this in the following ways: 

1. Supporting our research partners in the use of diverse geo-mapping and timeline-based social media platforms that provide an opportunity for small civic and social institutions to be publicly recognised as knowledge agents and sources of expertise and creativity. 



2. Designing and implementing experiments in community tagging and online curation designed to improve and enhance the culture of online discussion and comment. Supporting web redesign in order to better connect community reporters.



3. Disseminating models of good practice in the adoption of digital technologies and social media platforms for the purposes of dialogue and exchange that exemplify the principles of mutual recognition and reciprocity.

Over an extended period of fieldwork lasting twenty months we worked with two educational partners: Salford City College, a large multi-site further education sixth-form college and Oasis Academy MediaCityUK, a secondary school. In collaboration with our partners we planned and implemented a series of practical interventions designed to explore the potential for digital platforms and infrastructures, especially social media, to provide a foundation for communicative agency that could connect institutions of formal learning with their neighbourhoods, with wider society and social debate. Through workshops, mentoring, training and support for staff and students, alongside periods of reflection we worked to overcome a series of initial constraints due to time, technological awareness, and conflicts with existing college-based systems of accountability. The college was in a transitional phase where conventional digital technologies (VLE, Intranet) had been mastered but social media remained a challenge. A shift had to be culturally negotiated from digital platforms focused on delivery to digital platforms and infrastructures facilitating dialogue, exchange and collaborative participation on scales far larger than the institution had, until then, negotiated. What was implied was an even greater institutional shift from essentially a 'closed' community with a particular focus (teaching and learning) to a more 'open' community that connected with its wider networks on a basis of mutual recognition (as equal voices in a distributed narrative exchange). Insofar as students engaged purposefully with social media such as Twitter, there were clear signs of proto-agency around digital platforms, pointing, for the longer term, to the development of wider civic participation among students and between students and staff.

Prior to our fieldwork, social networks (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube) were used by our educational partners mainly for broadcasting and promotional purposes. The college's existing digital infrastructures and processes were focused primarily on institutional needs. Desktop technologies for specialisms (Media, Art, Graphic Design) were much in evidence, as were institution-wide curriculum delivery (Moodle VLE), management tools and websites (including the use of Facebook, Twitter and YouTube for promotional activity). As engagement in Storycircle progressed, use of social networks by teachers increased. Student contributions also began to be recognised at institutional level on the college's social networks. At departmental level, social media use was more successful in directly engaging students, especially where championed by staff or student enthusiasts. Here, staff and students voluntarily continued their conversation beyond the timetabled curriculum, allowing for a new immediacy of interaction. Through the mixing of the formal (departmental Twitter account) with informal (extra-curricular, everyday context) we see the potential of socially-mediated digital platforms to open up more flexible learning structures and more focused debate: bridging formal and informal learning contexts, merging curricular content with real-world scenarios.



During and in response to our fieldwork, college regulatory structures around Wi-Fi access (previously available via networked computers) were reshaped to permit student access using mobile technologies for the Twitter event. Thus, mobile phones, generally perceived as disruptive technologies in the college setting, began to be perceived as valuable for certain kinds of activity. The Twitter event in Phase 2 of the study acted as a catalyst for dialogue amongst college leaders around open access to college networks by students and their potential use for 'open' debate. Student access to the Wi-Fi network was deemed a success and, subsequently, availability was extended to other parts of the college. Signs of new narrative exchange (tweeting, blogging, commenting and distributed audio trails facilitated by QR codes linked to web-based content) between students and staff as well as a more open digital architecture (free college-wide Wi-Fi access, ability to use personal and mobile technologies and greater dialogic engagement with social media platforms) were, by the end of our fieldwork, beginning to emerge. 
.

Beneficiaries: Students, Staff, and Senior Management. School communities (including families, ex-pupils and local people). Applies to Compulsory and Higher-Education sectors.

Contribution Method: The study comprised an evolving research design in three phases. Each phase was negotiated, developed and co-designed in collaboration with study participants (staff, students, managers). 



Phase 1 was exploratory. Using storytelling workshops, observations and interviews with college leaders, staff and students, this phase generated dialogue around existing social and digital infrastructures. Desired outcomes for narrative exchange identified here were (1) a public-facing storytelling event; (2) a website showcase linking students' (digital) content to curricular-related project briefs; and (3) the integration of social media with college activities, with training workshops for staff and students. 



In Phase 2, constraints identified in Phase 1 led to a study re-design that focused on Twitter and a Twitter event initially conceived as a social media awareness event to stimulate student debate on issues relevant to them. 



In Phase 3 we designed interventions with staff and students in art and design enhancing their output through distributed audio trails facilitated by QR codes linked to web-based content. This was developed as part of the college input into a city-wide community festival of mass narrative. We also conducted a multi-site campus survey and produced a report for the college on the adoption, use and perceptions of digital technologies amongst enrolled students aged 16-19. The report found that students report having used social media for a diversity of learning-&amp;shy;_related purposes, including finding information (68%) and discussing college work with peers (73%) or teachers (27%). Students appear to have experience of using social media for learning in a variety of contexts, though they were more likely to have used social media for self-&amp;shy;_directed learning outside of the classroom than for teacher-led activities. 

 

The research led to changes in the use of social media and mobile technology at all levels of college: individual teachers approach to mobile use and departmental engagement with social media, and college-wide impacts involving the use of screens in public areas and open access to the college Wi-Fi. Other major policy changes reported include a significant shift towards recognising the benefits of working with external partners as a result of our research.

Our research has helped develop methods for unlocking the rich archival materials held by small community organisations. We have established and sustained key skills and resources necessary for community groups to promote access and engagement with their historic documents, photographs and films. We have provided support and guidance through all stages of the digitisation process, advising on digital storage, file formats and file structures for a range of archival resources. We have enhanced existing practices of archival engagement by making audio-visual material available to members of community organisations to use in digital storytelling workshops. We have experimented with various configurations of online platform and web-based publishing, providing combinations of storage and curation (for example through geo-mapping, photo-sharing timelines) for digital multi-media assets.

Small community organisations are often rich in archival material related to the history of their organisation and its membership but of wider social and historical significance. Yet they frequently lack the resources and skills to properly preserve these materials or make them publicly accessible. Our research has supported community organisations to develop their archival agendas and enabled individual members of these organisations engage with and contribute to the organisations history. By providing advice, mentoring, workshop activities and contacts with the professional archival community we have supported community organisations to simultaneously preserve, value and open up their collections. As one aspect of this broader notion of the civic archive we have supported community organisations and educational partners to develop strategies that enable them to make use, on their own terms of the archival potential of online platforms to provide public access to digitised multi-media content.

Beneficiaries: Local commuity groups and wider communities. Regional digital economy agencies needing to identify sources of authentic local content and establish meaningful commuity engagement.

Contribution Method: Our research has sought to establish the skills and resources necessary for such local community groups to preserve, curate and share such content - and the vital stories that they contain - for themselves.



We have developed methodologies for the civic archive in the following ways: 



1. Providing expertise and guidance through the digitisation process, specifically advising on file storage, file formats and file structures that enable navigation. 



2. Providing guidance on preservation standards and connecting our community partners with the professional archival community.



3. Co-designing processes of archival engagement and collective memory work with our partners using innovative digital storytelling, photo-elicitation and map-based storygathering methods. 



4. Co-designing experiments with our research partners into different configurations of online platforms for the purposes of storing, curating and sharing archival collections in such as way as to connect them in space and time with wider narratives. 




This aspect of the Storycircle research approach investigates how web analytics systems are applied by organizations to ensure they are meeting their overall goals as organizations, with particular reference to those with social aims. In a social analytics approach, the research team trace the ways particular organizations reflect upon, and subsequently seek to adjust their actions and self-presentation, in the light of analytic measures of their digital presence. The social analytics approach involves following this process closely through a series of carefully calibrated stages to understand better the reflexive life of organizations in today's digital world, and how in turn these understandings act towards their self-positioning within this competitive landscape.



The social analytics approach has involved a range of stages that build from an initial consultation that helps to identify the core areas of difference, or 'intended outcomes', which a specific organisational programme is intended to deliver on. This approach is founded on the principle that it is only by being clear about the questions being asked of an analytic system that meaningful answers can be generated. Thus web analytic systems are only brought into consideration once clarity of these core areas, and hence what needs to be measured in order to have a sense of the extent to which overall aims are being met, are established. The process then enables a framework within which a suite of web analytics tools can be developed. These tools range from: purpose built modules within the web platform, such as Druple's Views module; the adaptation of freely available web analytics tools, such as Google Analytics; using analytics functionality available within social media plug-ins, such as Facebook, Disqus or Storify; to the repurposing of administrative systems, such as CRM databases, mailing lists and calendars.



All organizations today appear to need a presence online. The quality of that presence affects how they are perceived by others, and so how they can operate and meet their goals. An effective web presence can also foster richer processes of consultation and reflection within organizations. This is particularly important for social and community organizations.



As a result, all sorts of organizations today must use measures to assess their digital presence, whether standard analytics from Google or customized measures. They will also reflect more broadly on the flows of information and comment on their sites, and on how people interact with their online content. 'Analytics' is the word we use for all these forms of reflection, measurement and evaluation. From this term we build on the widely used term 'social analytics' and repurpose to capture the sociological analysis of everyday uses of such tools within social organisations.



Our research investigates how analytics get used by organizations to ensure they are meeting their overall goals as organizations. Particular organizations will reflect upon, and adjust their actions and self-presentation, in the light of analytic measures of their digital presence. The social analytics approach involves following this process closely through a series of carefully calibrated stages to understand better the life of organizations in today's digital world. 



With an analytics framework established, a critical process of acting and reflecting on the outcomes within it commences, typically implementing them for a sustained period of many months, and involving as many members of the organisation as possible. As each phase of action ends it is reflected on and used to trigger a further phase of action. 



This process is described in other supporting documents, see: www.storycircle.co.uk. 


Beneficiaries: PVM Senior Management, Staff and National Network of Community Reporter groups. Similar Social Enterprises will also benefit from Sample Resources avaiable at www.storycircle.com; Salford Lads Club

Contribution Method: This approach has been used to support organisations working in and around the MediaCityUK development to address issues that emerge in particular around a lack of public engagement and interactivity with their websites. 



In the PVM case, this has been achieved by identifying core areas of site metadata to be enhanced so that users can navigate, find and explore site content more easily; exploring new functionality to include in pages that might encourage visitors to actively engage with content, such as 'community tagging' modules, shared discussion pages and interactive maps; and Co-designing and implementing a series of 'content curation' experiments whereby users interact with a human curator via the web space and its content. [for details see the PVM 'Collaboration' outcome].



In the SLC case, this involved a 'webhack day' with club members and local programmer, Steven Flowers, on producing interactive webpages for the club's content about its annual camp to Wales, compiled into an interactive timeline of its camping history. This involved uploading metadata and content into a shared Google document, writing copy and embedding a range of third-party plugins and social media tools (YouTube, Flickr, Facebook, Google Maps, Storify, JS Timeline) into the SLC's Wordpress site. [For details see the SLC output 'Interactive Camping Histories and Timeline' outcome].



The 'Social Analytics' approach of on-going, monitored and reflexive practice with particular partners was developed by the Storycircle research team. This involves a long-term consultation process and is always shaped by the specific context in which the fieldwork occurs. This process is described in other supporting documents (see www.storycircle.co.uk The social analytics approach will be of potential use to a broad range of community-focused social enterprises and organisations. It is likely to be particularly relevant to those groups and organisations that work with community practitioners using digital tools and resources and/or involve some form of shared content production.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2010</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>C6A0F834-EC1B-4DDF-BB9F-E4205897851C</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>m-1858165703.5818002de2558d4</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software)</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The rationale for the FIRM partnership centred on MediaCityUK and a concept unique in the UK (though not the world) to develop a 'city' based on and around media in its broadest sense. This involved platform providers such as the BBC, IT and technology providers such as BT and content providers including artists, individuals and communities. The Universities involved in the partnership include University of Salford; Goldsmiths, University of London, and Lancaster University. FIRM also works closely with key academics at the University of Cambridge and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who through their investigation into New Century Cities across the world highlighted distinctive shared features to be considered as possible enablers of forward movement for FIRM and MediaCityUK. 

Academics working on the project came from a variety of backgrounds including: social media, digital technologies, and the built environment. A number of small creative businesses and community organisations joined the project at various stages. 

FIRM's approach was to undertake a number of research activities in bespoke areas to generate an understanding of a very diverse 'industry and sector' and to create and apply knowledge and its relevance and impact to both FIRM and MediaCityUK as a location. This would provide the evidential base against which we can identify what if any are the boundaries in which media and digital industries operate or find themselves restricted to. 

The Key findings from the areas of research that the project principally explored are: 


? Emergent forms of digital citizenship

Digital workshops, community debates and public exhibitions were held to interact with the wider Salford community during the construction of the MediaCityUK development to gain a better understanding of how social media worked within local communities and the level to which it was democratic. Findings resulted in the development of the Storycircle project led by Goldsmiths; Storycircle was grounded in existing narrative research that tells us that narrative is empowering and opportunities for narrative exchange are important ways of recognising people as citizens and as human beings; it also tells us that narratives connect people, and the exchange of narratives can connect people who would not otherwise be linked and so generate new insights and knowledge, to the benefit of those involved. 
 
This project undertook research into how in the era of digital media such narrative processes can be enhanced and contribute to economy and society. In the course of the project Goldsmiths facilitated a process of narrative production and exchange, working with its FIRM research partners. The project generated a narrative ecology in collaboration with local actors and stakeholders to reveal emergent forms of digital citizenship, create a 'social analytics' approach to organisational self-reflection and produce digital methodologies for supporting knowledge production.

? A means for collaborative digital production
Research into modern open-source techniques for agile collaboration was initiated in response to an industry need highlighted by the BBC. This required an online platform capable of supporting collaborative multimedia creation in a way that is plausibly usable for both amateurs and professionals. Lancaster University working with the BBC undertook the remit of identifying and developing a rich media platform for enhanced media and digital content sharing. The platform was developed in collaboration with an SME. The 'Storisphere' interface was the result. The benefits to industry and individual/local groups; allowed disparate users to produce stories collaboratively from shared video clips on various types of user devices and networks. A Living Lab approach with IPTV service experiments and user engagement in the vicinity of MediaCityUK, Salford and Wray supported the development of a media assets referencing system, video storytelling frontend interface, video and subtitle analysis package, and video chuck stitching and caching software. 

? An 'Internet of Things' framework for prototyping mobile and physical computing use cases

With networked devices becoming more ubiquitous, there are more opportunities for a connected immersive experiences using BBC content for example. The 'Internet of Things' project produced a practical toolset that enabled research to be undertaken into the user experience and how greater opportunities for immersive experiences can be developed. Outputs from this included:

1. Documentation describing a common network API, 

2. Discovery: connections, 

3. Capability description/usage, and plumbing

4. Creating a software platform as a testbed for future ongoing developments and as a hardware device prototyping platform, enabling ongoing device exploration. 



The project also produced an end-to-end functioning prototype demonstrating the case for a connected fob for tagging a moment in radio broadcast.



? A proposed hyperlocal TV sports solution

 

FIRM research around digital citizenship, storytelling and the creation of tools for collaboration led to an investigation around 'hyperlocal' sports coverage. This involved local citizens using mobile technology to report on sports events in the Salford area. This was identified as an area of major interest for BT. A project was designed to explore the notion of hyperlocal through creating and auditioning sports content in the Salford area, with findings feeding into a proposal to incorporate hyperlocal content into current TV offerings and mainstream programming. 

 

 

? A digital platform to support policy makers and education



Research resulted in the development of a data model integrating disparate datasets within system architecture to support evidence-based decision-making and policy development. A key aim was to provide a greater understanding to planners of how the impact both positive and negative of a development such as MediaCityUK could both be enhanced or mitigated by better access to data. This was validated through a 'live projects brief' which included using flood risks, social housing, and welfare reforms data creating interactive interfaces that enhanced user engagement. Applications of this additionally supported learning and education, using gestures and tangible interfaces for creative play from a variety of users interested in urban planning.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>A principal aim was to create a body of work and research that was very relevant to the non academic community. In addition to the exploitation routes above the potential further use (and long term impact) in a non academic environment includes:

A widening of the geographical spread of the Project from its initial testbed; that is Salford. The project worked with a number of local community based organisations to great effect creating a knowledge exchange with Salford City College, Salford Lads' Club, Oasis Academy, MediaCityUK, People's Voice Media and The Islington Estate Tenants and Residents Association. Issues of engagement and knowledge exchange between these organizations and HE was driven by a desire to exploit the opportunities offered by MediaCityUK. However lessons learnt could be applied to many similar concepts where major urban redevelopment greatly impact on traditional communities and urban patterns. 

Equally the 'Virtual Community Engagement' and the development of the digital city environment (using advanced visualisation techniques to aid engagement and decision-making) was applied to support the Better Life Chances project, led by the 'Place Board' involving key stakeholders in Salford. The Place Board was made up of senior members from key agencies in the city such as Salford City Council, Greater Manchester Police, Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service, Greater Manchester Against Crimes, Salford PCT, Salix Homes, City West, Job Centre Plus, Environment Agency, with a common objective of creating sustainable environments for three socially deprived areas in Salford greatly affected by MediaCityUK (Little Hulton, Broughton and Winton). FIRM demonstrated a number of ways in which HEI's can play a larger role in the understanding and development of societies. This research work allowed agencies in Salford to enhance their current partnership working methods by adopting a novel joint insight platform based on advanced digital technology. Several other city councils are now interested in deploying this digital platform for their partnership working in their city. For example, City councils of Stoke-on-Trent and Manchester City are now working with the THINKLab to explore how the digital city platform could be used to support their partnership challenges in creating sustainable cities.
 The idea behind FIRM is to provide a forum for exploitation. Key outputs have identified a number of diverse users and collaborators within the FIRM project. From Community groups and organisations, to public bodies such as the Police, Local Authorities, Schools and Businesses including BT the BBC and a number small and medium sized businesses. The principal aim of FIRM is to generate cross sectoral learning, knowledge and collaboration involving technology providers, platforms, content writers and users. Exploitation has resulted in:

? The creation of a new shared platform for content writers, users and major platforms (BBC and BT)

? A greater understanding and relationships between communities using social media and creating digital content, platforms and users with the potential such as the hyperlocal project for this to become mainstream broadcasting.

? A greater understanding through a digital platform for planners and policy makers to understand the complex nature of planning major developments such as MediaCityUK and its impact on local resources that will be used by the Greater Manchester Police and other organisations involved in emergency planning. 

? A metadata study that will inform policy makers within research organisations (RCUK and HEI's) with regard to the scope and potential for future research around digital media with a greater understanding of the needs of businesses, users and communities.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>AD14D077-506B-43B8-9B64-D61DB3F1959D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-7761929582.582721775b950c</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Healthcare,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.firm-innovation.net</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Salford City Council's Engagement Programme [GOLD]</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>97F8832F-6DA1-4A21-A487-E3B5D11187D0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Storycircle digital narrative project within FIRM has been written into Salford City Council's Engagement Programme for MediaCityUK, as an example of good practice in the area of digital engagement, and has influenced the important inclusion of narrative exchange as a thematic strand within the Salford Quays Cultural Strategy and Framework 2012-2015.

The questionnaire comprised of 31 questions focusing on basic demographics; access to and general use of mobile phones, the internet, and social media; existing learning-related use of digital technologies; interest in using social media to support future learning and attitudes towards the college?s use of digital technologies. The questionnaire is deposited at the UK Data Archive and is available for other researchers for non-commercial use.

The model utilised QR codes linked to audio narratives stored on Soundcould to complement a visual exhibition of student work on the theme of Secret Gardens. This was a new model of presentation, combining the physical and virtual, and enabling students to dialogue with their audience in absentia. Audio recordings for the exhibition were generated in a researcher-supported workshop with a class of around 20 students and their tutor. Students' work was presented to staff, parents and future students at college open day. The model was deemed successful, and potentially groundbreaking as a model for a blended exhibition format for future exhibit work both in college and beyond.</gtr:description><gtr:id>18CD9FCA-1685-4EB5-96BD-F6775CFF8F19</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-6514526509.2277216fd26bf0</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>QR-Supported Virtual Exhibition Model [GOLD; SCC].</gtr:title><gtr:type>Systems, Materials &amp; Instrumental Engineering</gtr:type></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>This project presents a new way of experiencing music.

With the growing popularity of social networks and video services, users are becoming the editors and broadcasters of their own stories. User-generated video content, which provides unique perspectives from individuals, is likely to be the new medium to complement professional broadcast TV for story sharing, especially in user communities of specific interest. We have developed Storisphere to provide a web-based collaborative video content workspace for members of a community to compose and share video stories, using desktop or mobile devices. Storisphere is currently being evaluated for video story telling by various user communities.
