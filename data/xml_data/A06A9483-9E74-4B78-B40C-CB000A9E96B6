future leaders by funding doctoral training across a wide range of Technology, Engineering and
Physical Science research areas. The research in which doctoral students are involved includes
discovery-led projects in new and innovative areas, as well as that which addresses established
strategic themes.
The main opportunity delivered by the DTP is in providing funding to enable students to undertake
doctoral research projects. Approximately 80 such students are recruited each year, across a range
of fields. In recent years, the approximate number of projects available in each area has been 30 in
Engineering, 15 in Physics, 10 in Chemistry, 10 in Mathematics, 5 in Chemical Engineering, 5 in
Computing and 5 in Materials Science. A small number of studentships are also funded in areas of
Physical Science relating to Earth Sciences, Biological Sciences and Architecture.
These studentships are fully-funded (fees and maintenance) for UK students, provide fees for EU
students from outside the UK, and a small number can be used to fund students from outside the EU
under the International Doctoral Scholar Scheme.
PhD projects funded through the DTP are typically hosted in research groups which are recognised
as delivering internationally excellent and world leading outputs. There is also significant focus on
links with industrial partners, in order to deliver impact, including CASE studentships via which
students have the opportunity to develop significant links with a company.
In addition to the skills gained during the PhD research, students also undertake a Researcher
Development programme, with courses and activities tailored to their needs and selected from a
wide range of provision. This equips those completing their doctoral programmes to develop the
broad skill set which will make them well-placed to develop into future leaders across a range of
carn the academic, industrial and public sectors.
The DTP also funds around ten Doctoral Prizes each year, allowing students at the end of their
doctoral studies to progress to research assistant or research associate posts, enabling them to
move high quality work to publication or to transfer technologies.
An additional opportunity is the funding of around fifteen vacation bursaries each year, enabling the
best undergraduate students to gain a first experience of research in order to assess whether they
wish to progress to doctoral training after their undergraduate degree.

Applications from eligible students can be considered by host Departments throughout the year, but
students wishing to begin projects in October are encouraged to apply by early December the
previous year. Students from groups currently underrepresented in Engineering and Physical Science
subjects are particularly encouraged to apply.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>12785984</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/N509620/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
