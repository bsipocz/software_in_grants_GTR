This strategy is comprised of four elements, with a degree of concurrency:

{a} IP SECURING: The technology developed in this project will have an equipment, consumables and know-how output: [1] Equipment - Nutrient sensory system, feedback and control system. The method of delivery being based on (a) MIP sensor array, for specific nutrients, in sealed unit with in-out irrigation channel connected to nutrient solution monitoring location via peristaltic pump and (b) a wireless feedback link to monitoring screen / logging system, in turn linked to dosing control system, including peristaltic dosing pumps, with manual or automated / preconfigured control options (see Know How below); [2] Consumables - low-cost user replaceable MIP cartridge with in-built solvents / reagents reservoir. Can be sent via post and 'exhausted' units returned for resetting / environmental disposal and; [3] Know-how - precise nutrient recipes, fertigation and irrigation strategies for specific crops and varieties for automated nutrient control. Method of delivery likely to be as software control package delivered on one-off purchase or subscription basis (possibly via internet) providing ongoing revenue and commercial drive for continued research (comprehensive know-how for automated nutrient control of specific varieties could also be integrated into the sensor itself as firmware). 

{b} EXEMPLIFICATION &amp;amp; DISSEMINATION: During the project period SB will trial the prototype developed with UoM and demonstrate it to potential roll-out partners. The next stage, following this feasibility project, will be for the potential partners to test it and to organise large scale trials with commercial hydroponic growers (see below). The intention is that these partners will become involved in the commercial roll-out of the technology including or prior to the trace element sensory component.

{c} FUTURE TECHNOLOGY SUPPLY CHAIN DEVELOPMENT: The potential partners who will be 'in-the-loop', i.e. consulted under non-disclosure terms, at this early stage include: Synchemicals Group (including Hortifeeds, Vitax and NuTrel); Nunhems Seeds (the seed division of Bayer Crop Science); Hazeldene (leading freshly prepared salad supplier) and; Arid Agritech. It is inappropriate, given the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and nascent IP position to include them as full partners at this stage. The limited competition that does exist within the market comes from ISE sensors, therefore CleanGrow are also a likely future partner. 

{d} ROLE OUT PLAN &amp;amp; SYSTEM-BUILD COSTS: To meet these goals it is essential to deliver a specific and continuous nutrient monitoring system with an acceptable response time (&amp;lt;30 mins) for closed loop control of the hydroponic system. The proposed MIP unit has an anticipated Bill-of-Materials (BOM) and modular Systems Architecture (see Appendix C) such that the sensor chassis may be fabricated for &amp;lt;&amp;pound;500 per unit, at low numbers (10s-100s), with each specific measurands adding an additional &amp;lt;&amp;pound;100 capital cost and &amp;lt;&amp;pound;10 per annum operating costs (i.e. replacement wetted sensor elements &amp;amp; solvents). With value-engineering and volume sales (&amp;gt;10,000 units) these figures have been estimated to drop by 20-30%. Given an initial trade sale price of &amp;pound;1,500-2,500 for the unit, ROI of 3-5 times should be readily achievable on unit sales alone, with additional returns based on the sale of agronomy &amp;amp; maintenance services and consumables for system upkeep and application development.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-07-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>150408</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project is demonstrating the ability to detect phosphate nutrients in real-time through a combination of semi-selective molecularly imprinted polymer sensors and array-processing of the data.
