Both the UK and Japan have developed world-leading research groups in the fields of the physics and applications of superconductivity over a number of decades. However, it is only in recent years, for example, that long lengths of high-quality tape high temperature superconducting (HTS) materials, which show the most promise currently for meaning practical applications, have been available. There are also continuing developments in other areas of physics and materials science, too, which have led to the development in recent years of new superconductors, such as magnesium diboride (MgB2) and the iron pnictides.

Fundamental research is still required because of the complexity of the materials, and applications research can benefit greatly from the discovery of new superconductors that offer improvements over existing materials. There is a close and complementary relationship between physics and engineering in this field, with many physicists now working in superconducting materials engineering and applied superconductivity. This is particularly true of the effort in superconductivity research in Japan over the past couple of decades, and makes this a natural theme for the workshop. Although a great number of developments have already taken place, there are still many unanswered questions regarding the underlying physical mechanisms of superconductivity - a complete theory is still proving elusive for high temperature superconductivity, for example.

Applied research is also necessary to develop practical, real world applications of superconductivity. In the field of electrical engineering alone, for example, the expected improved performance and efficiency, as well as smaller size and weight, has seen much interest in using these materials in electric machines and other electric power applications such as transformers and cables. Superconductors are also being used in the field of quantum computing - for example, the only quantum computer currently on sale uses superconducting flux qubits and in quantum photonics as single photon detectors.

The workshop will be comprised of longer contributed talks by senior academics and shorter contributed talks by early career researchers and students, and cover a wide range of themes, ranging from the underlying physics that explains superconductivity to the development and prediction of new superconducting materials to the design of practical and commercially viable superconducting devices. Bringing together a critical mass of world-leading researchers of the physics and applications of superconductivity from the UK and Japan will provide the perfect platform to encourage exchange of ideas and scientific discussions and allow the formation of formal and informal international collaborations between researchers. It is now the perfect time to bring together leading researchers from the two countries for a multidisciplinary workshop to discuss the current state-of-the-art and problems, and to help guide the future direction of research in these highly complementary fields.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>There is a close and complementary relationship between physics and engineering in the field of superconductivity, with many physicists now working in superconducting materials engineering and applied superconductivity, and vice versa. This is particularly true of the effort in superconductivity research in Japan over the past couple of decades, and makes this a natural theme for the workshop. The high quality and appropriate balance of researchers forming the scientific organising committee will ensure the scientific programme is world class and the selection of keynote speakers - all world leaders in their respective areas - will ensure the workshop receives a high level of interest, and hence the highest potential for forming strong collaborative links between researchers in the two countries.

Bringing together a critical mass of world-leading researchers of the physics and applications of superconductivity from the UK and Japan, including researchers from the University of Cambridge, Kyoto University, the University of Tokyo and RIKEN, will encourage the exchange of ideas and scientific discussions, and strengthen existing collaborations and provide a strong foundation for new formal and informal international collaborations. The workshop will enable the following goals to be achieved: Outline the existing research themes and capabilities of researchers in both countries; highlight areas of complementary research between countries/fields of research; and identify the most significant challenges existing in the field and provide adequate direction to attempt to solve these. There are also sponsorship opportunities for companies working with or interested in superconductivity and its applications will be available, giving participants and industry to engage in valuable conversation for potential future collaboration and/or investment.

Both the UK and Japan have a number of research groups that have a world-leading reputation in their particular areas of research across a broad range of topics. Cambridge, in particular, is a significant hub for superconductivity research and has a long and illustrious history in this field, in particular through the Interdisciplinary Research Centre in Superconductivity. Additionally, there is a great deal of excitement around the Bulk Superconductivity Group in the Department of Engineering at the University of Cambridge, led by Prof. David Cardwell, recently surpassing the world record in the highest trapped field in bulk superconductor samples. A trapped field of 17.6 T at 26 K in a stack of two GdBCO bulk superconductors has been achieved, the largest reported to date in any material at any temperature, beating the decade long-standing record of 17.24 T at 29 K. The latter held previously by Profs Tomita and Murakami, working in the Superconductivity Research Lab, a research division of the International Superconductivity Technology Center (ISTEC) in Tokyo, Japan. This more recent record field has renewed enthusiasm in this particular area of superconductivity and opens up the prospect of easy access to portable, high magnetic fields. As a result of these endeavours, we are now on the cusp of harnessing the true potential of these technologically important materials in practical devices.

In summary, this workshop will bring together leading UK and Japanese scientists in this maturing and technologically important field of research with a specific focus on future collaboration for the first time. The workshop will enable coherent information exchange, which is essential to the effective continued and development of superconducting materials for sustainable engineering applications. The workshop is based on the excellent working relation developed between key, world-leading researchers and has the potential to impact significantly on the medium to long term economic prospects of both countries, as superconducting applications head towards industrially viable commercialisation.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-09-08</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-02-09</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>26493</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>79 delegates attended the workshop from the UK, Japan and Europe, including representatives from four industrial sponsors/exhibitors - IOP Publishing, Opera, Oxford Instruments, and Sumitomi (SHI) Cryogenics - and the main topics of discussion covered by the 44 talks (7 keynote, 3 invited and 34 contributed) and 20 posters included: Applications (Large-scale, and small-scale / electronics); Superconducting materials (Bulk superconductors, HTS coated conductors, iron-based superconductors, fullerides, and superconducting joints); Physics (Charge density waves in cuprates, properties of superconductors, and high-Tc superconductivity).
