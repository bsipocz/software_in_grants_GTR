The introduction of a consolidation centre aims to empower the consumer with respect to the delivery method in the last five miles of the package journey, also enables supplies to be consolidated upstream and downstream of the centre. Statistics show that 30% of small packages dispatched to customer homes fail to be delivered first time. Failed deliveries significantly reduce the productivity of the logistics provider and increase congestion and pollution. Consumers are aware that deliveries to their home may fail repeatedly but there exist no mechanisms to engage with the supply chain. In the UK, many courier firms are engaged in multiple drops to the same urban area each day, increasing pollution and congestion with no value added to the consumer. This pilot involves -the development of a portal that provides consumer choice features including packaging type, traceability, time and mode of delivery (e.g. sustainable vehicle solutions)-a local urban consolidation centre, open 24x7, providing opportunities for easy access for consumers, consolidation opportunities for primary suppliers and last mile couriers where packages are required to be delivered to the home, and facilities to minimize packaging at source and optimize recyclingThe novelty lies in the front end consumer portal enabling consumer choice, the integrated consolidation centre and in the delivery network involving key stakeholders in the supply chain.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>121999</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Direct-to-consumer business delivery has risen exponentially during the last decade. This rapid development has highlighted many challenges and problems within the logistics system, and the subsequent need for optimisation. The multiple stakeholders involved in e-tailing, conventional retail, parcel delivery and transport systems within a particular geography is complex, with multiple (yet un-realised) opportunities for data sharing and systems integration. The total UK postal services market was valued at &amp;pound;11bn in 2007/2008, including &amp;pound;4bn in courier and express delivery items, and &amp;pound;1.5bn in parcels. At present, UK logistics providers report that 30% of small packages dispatched to customer homes fail to be delivered first time, resulting in poor customer service and avoidable logistics inefficiencies. This, in turn, results in larger numbers of delivery runs, which exacerbates urban congestion, pollution and accident levels. For the general public, there are significant negative environmental and societal impacts caused by increased numbers of vehicles, which are often unsuitable for urban infrastructure in a specific geographical area. In the business-to-customer (B2C) and customer-to-customer (C2C) context, the &amp;quot;last mile&amp;quot; is one of the most cost intensive elements. Failed deliveries significantly reduce the productivity of the logistics provider with lack of integration meaning many courier firms are engaged in multiple drops to the same urban area each day, with no value added to the consumer.

This research project involved set-up and operation of a Consumer Choice Portal and Package Consolidation Centre (PPCC) pilot project e.g. focusing on delivery of packages to the home, supported by a packaging consolidation centre, located adjacent to a densely populated urban environment. Consumers are aware that deliveries to their home may fail repeatedly; however, no effective mechanisms existed to engage with the supply chain. The consolidation centre pilot concept (as part of this research) looked to empower the consumer with respect to the delivery method in the 'last mile' of the package journey. Initial pilot test results on first time deliveries have shown success rates of &amp;gt;99% (c.f. 70% success rates presently within the UK parcel delivery sector).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2010</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>7E68DE87-D36F-4E93-8BE5-6408E07A1920</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54610d848789d8.46110470</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Environment,Retail,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project focused on the delivery of packages to the home, driven by an online portal and supported by a packaging consolidation centre located next to a densely populated urban environment.
The approach developed, as part of the research, was applied to develop a novel last-mile supply chain configuration. One key element of this was a 'consumer portal'. This shows an which enabled the consumer to make informed decisions regarding the mode of last-mile delivery and to take control of timing, cost, reliability and 'greenness'. The approach also led to detailed mapping of the order/delivery system for a single parcel, and development of a physical consolidation centre that handles the incoming packages from the logistics provider for last-mile provision.
The key benefits delivered by the project included improved consumer choice on delivery mode and timing, alongside improved service, reduction in congestion and improved environmental performance.

Key academic outputs included:

a) Development of a 2-echelon supply chain (SC) model for the 'Last Mile'
b) Understanding Customer, Industrial, Institutional and SC drivers in terms of parcel delivery
c) Exploration of the usage habits of actual users including drivers and motivations
d) Development of overlapping metrics involving the 3 actor groups (i.e. Customer, Industry, Institution); overlaps between actor pairings; common interests and trade-offs
e) Exploration of scale-up opportunities through potential partnerships
f) Development of a 'concept of operations' for Consolidation centres
g) Identification of potential revenue streams with other supply chain actors and possible extension to B2B context (i) downstream with public sector bodies and (ii) Upstream with 'competing' couriers
h) Advancing the critical 'Triple Helix' concept e.g. interests and engagement of the different stakeholders (e.g. institution, industry and customer)</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The approaches developed as part of this research have already been used to inform assessment of future service provision in the public sector. In this particular case, the approaches were used to examine current operations and opportunities for process optimisation and cross-service integration across a series of services.
In general, the approaches and findings from the original research may help inform future service requirements that can be tested against likely future trends - social, technological, industrial, economic, and political - and the impact these emerging scenarios might have on strategic decisions.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>28FD49BD-9609-4932-8BB9-FE4FB09B207D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54649996a375c0.58865272</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Retail,Transport,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.ifm.eng.cam.ac.uk/research/global-networks/emerging-themes/e-commerce-driven-last-mile-logistics/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>23C6D72A-EB7F-471B-9F53-E5B45177FD25</gtr:id><gtr:title>Identifying design criteria for urban system &amp;acirc;??last-mile&amp;acirc;?? solutions &amp;acirc;?? a multi-stakeholder perspective</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Production Planning &amp;
