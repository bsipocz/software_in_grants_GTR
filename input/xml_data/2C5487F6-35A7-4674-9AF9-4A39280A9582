Indeed, the Encyclop&amp;aelig;dia Britannica gives SAW as one of two examples of classical combinatorial problems. Recent work on SAW includes a rigorous mathematical study by Fields medallist Stanislav Smirnov. Polymer models incorporating more realistic effects, such as internal structure and interactions, are considerably harder to analyse. Normally not even the existence of the thermodynamic limit is proven, and one focusses either on computer simulations or on the study of somewhat simplified models that allow explicit solutions for the partition function, while still generally showing very complicated structures. 

I propose to combine cutting-edge algorithms in the areas of Monte-Carlo simulations, thereby developing a novel hybrid algorithm suitable for the simulation of compact polymers in spatially restricted environments, with the aim of investigating behaviour of polymers in dense environments or at low temperatures. Prominent examples are given by polymer crystallisation or the folding of proteins. 

This project crosslinks many different disciplines, ranging across Mathematics, Chemistry, and Biology, and the techniques developed within the context of lattice polymers will have an impact reaching far beyond this setting: the proposed algorithm development will be of benefit for general rare-event simulations in the context of complexity theory.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The algorithms developed in this project relate to underlying concepts that allow for efficient sampling of configurations (events, scenarios) in simulations of real-world situations. Therefore the research generated by this proposal has wide-reaching impact, direct as well as indirect, at a conceptual level for a large group of scientific and non-scientific beneficiaries. Ultimately more efficient sampling of possible states of complex systems can lead to deeper understanding of issues arising in areas as diverse as protein folding and dynamics of internet traffic.

The uniform sampling aspect of the proposed algorithms enables the study of the frequency and impact of rare and extreme events (large fluctuations) in these situations, allowing for enhanced statistics and thus better risk assessment of catastrophic events such as stock market crashes or extreme weather. There is ultimately scope for impact on contingency planning and engineering designs to reduce the risk of such events.

Therefore some aspects of the research and its significance can be communicated beyond the academic or technical community, for example, via non-specialist website material and outreach talks to local school students, particularly in the London area. The aim of this is to generate interest in young people to consider careers in science and mathematics, with positive UK economic implications in the longer term.

The immediate scientific impact of the research described in this proposal will be on our ability to investigate dense polymer systems via efficient simulations. As a result, scenarios currently inaccessible via simulation, such as the crystallisation transition of a collapsed polymer, can be investigated, ultimately leading to conceptual advances in the theoretical understanding of dense polymers and related soft matter.

There will be further academic impact in statistical physics, and notably also in computer science, as the ideas underlying the algorithmic development are applicable to a suite of algorithms useful for simulating a large variety of systems. For example, algorithms based on stochastic growth have been utilised to study the topology of complex networks.

Impact within the research area will be ensured via dissemination of results in high-level journals covering statistical mechanics and polymer physics; preprints will be made available on the arxiv preprint server for immediate open access. Results will further be presented in seminar talks, during collaborative research visits, and in relevant conferences and workshops, with regular attendance at meetings in the UK and abroad. A series of workshops directly related to the proposal, within the framework of the recently launched Queen Mary-Warwick workshop series on Random Combinatorial Structures and Statistical Mechanics, will contribute to the dissemination of results among scientists in applied probability and statistical mechanics. This will help to establish a sustained research activity in the area of statistical mechanics of lattice polymers in the UK, in applied as well as in mathematical directions.

The collaborations within this proposal are designed to achieve the ambitious primary goals of the project and the associated direct impact in statistical mechanics and polymer physics (see the Academic Beneficiaries section). Broader and non-academic impact activities will be carried out by the Principal Investigator in connection with his active departmental role.

It may be that outputs with impact are identified (e.g., through MSc projects or in discussion with other interdisciplinary or industrial contacts), even though no commercial applications are yet known. Resulting commercialisation opportunities will be actively explored using Queen Mary resources. Queen Mary has an experienced professional technology transfer office with the skills, expertise and resources to support the development of sustainable partnerships with business.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>261796</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Saskatoon summerschool</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>37591918-FC5C-4A69-9DC7-3C9A71D12FCA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The applied combinatorics graduate summer school is a two week program for Canadian and international students.

Using this new programme package, we have managed to shed light on several structural issues related to the study of polymer collapse:

- By studying the winding of two-dimensional polymers around a center, we have both confirmed existing theoretical predictions in the standard lattice model of polymer collapse as well as uncovered intriguing and hitherto theoretically not understood behaviour in a competing model.

- By defining a novel lattice model of self-avoiding paths which for which we propose the name &amp;quot;self-avoiding grooves&amp;quot;, we were able to study in detail the competition of three different interaction types and found an intriguingly complex phasediagram with three different low-temperature phases.

- By studying an extension of an exactly solvable lattice model, we elucidate the role many-body interactions play in the physics of polymer collapse.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The immediate scientific impact of the research described in this proposal will be on our ability to investigate dense polymer systems via efficient simulations.
