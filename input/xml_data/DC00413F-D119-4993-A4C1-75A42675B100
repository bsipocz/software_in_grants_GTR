With few exceptions, it is the prestige of 'canonical status' that has ensured the survival of some texts, while lack of it has occasioned the disappearance of others. Yet over the past 120 years significant fragments of this lost literature have been recovered, and much of the newly available material has close links with the familiar canonical texts. First articulated only in the late second century, the fourfold canonical gospel can no longer be seen as the inevitable outcome of a single linear process. This project will investigate ideological and political factors operative both in the construction of the canonical collection and in the various resistances that it provoked.\n\nIt will be argued that the early theorizers of the fourfold collection were motivated by the need for ecumenical consensus between major centres of Christian activity such as Rome, Alexandria, and Antioch, viewing it as a via media between acceptance of too many gospels (notably in the East) and too few (the West, where John, the 'fourth gospel', faced significant opposition). In spite of its apparent success, however, perceived weaknesses in the canonical construction rapidly generated a range of alternatives. The aim of the present project is not simply to describe the historical phenomena but also to recover the underlying logic of the various competing proposals.\n\nThe four selected gospels retell the same story in different and often incompatible ways. For some, this plural narration needed to be reduced to singularity. This could take the minimalistic form advocated by followers of Marcion, who used only an abridged version of the Gospel of Luke. The same concern for singularity is also evident in Tatian's influential Diatessaron, an ambitious attempt to incorporate material from all four gospels into a unified narrative which established a precedent for all later 'gospel harmonies'. For others, the aim was not to reduce plurality to but rather to supplement it with still more gospel literature. Texts such as the Protevangelium of James fill in the perceived gaps in the canonical accounts, supplying new narratives where none existed and adding vivid details to enliven the more restrained narration of its Matthean and Lukan sources. Others still valued gospels whose aim is not to supplement but rather to subvert the familiar canonical narratives - an intention embodied in the title of one recently rediscovered text, the Gospel according to Judas. Some centuries later, a still more drastic displacement of the canonical story takes shape in Qur'anic passages in which Jesus is assigned the role of precursor to the definitive Prophet. From its own perspective, the Qur'an purports to restore the image of the authentic Jesus, falsely deified and otherwise misrepresented in mainstream Christian gospel literature. Yet affinities with selected canonical or apocryphal traditions can still be traced, making it possible to view Islamic images of Jesus within the same frame as Christian ones.\n\nBy such means as these - conflation, supplementation, subversion, or displacement - individuals and communities signal their tacit or explicit rejection of the claim that Jesus' story must be told in precisely four different versions, neither more nor less. Recognition of this fact can serve to defamiliarize the canonical collection and raises questions about how its pluralism-within-limits is to be understood. Since neither the individual evangelists nor their first readers had any notion of a fourfold gospel, it must be seen as a genuinely new creation, more than the sum of its parts and an object of interpretation in its own right.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Details of the proposed impact-related activities are provided in the 'Pathway to Impact' document. In brief, they consist of a web-site on 'Early Christian Gospels'; preparation of materials for the Lindisfarne Gospel exhibition scheduled for summer 2013; and the writing of a nonspecialist book in the general area of the specialist monograph that is the project's primary output.\n\nIn very general terms, the non-academic beneficiaries of this project will be the wider (national and international) public who make use of the website or book; the 20-30,000 projected visitors to the exhibition; and the exhibition organizers (primarily Durham Cathedral, but with the involvement of Durham County Council, Durham City Vision, and Tyne and Wear Museums). The planned activities in relation to the exhibition enable a slightly more detailed breakdown of beneficiaries into (1) primary and secondary school parties and their teachers; (2) adult visitors in general, including many tourists; (3) participants in the day conference that will precede the exhibition, consisting mainly of relatively well-informed non-specialists.\n\nThrough these different communicative media, the project will deliver the following benefits:\n\n1. Certain widespread misconceptions will be addressed and, hopefully, dispelled. Making allowance for differences of age, religious affiliation, and educational attainment, these misconceptions include the following: only four gospels exist, and they were all written by reliable eyewitnesses shortly after the events they record; so-called 'gospels' outside the New Testament are simply ancient forgeries; or, conversely: the New Testament gospels corrupt the simple teaching of Jesus, preserved only in marginalized, non-hierarchical texts like the Gospels of Thomas, Judas, or Mary, in a form that can be straightforwardly appropriated in a post-Christian age. At every level, the project will foster a more informed engagement with texts that do not easily fit these ideologically driven specifications.\n\n2. The project will demonstrate the possibility of an intelligent public discourse about the gospels that does not immediately divide over the issue of belief or non-belief. What might loosely be described as 'religious heritage' is not just the concern of a religious minority but a subset of 'cultural heritage', which is of concern to all. Communicating this point at a variety of educational levels will be the main objective of the interpretative material prepared for the exhibition, but it is also integral to the project as a whole.\n\n3. The project will create a greater awareness of the diversity of beliefs and commitments that existed from the earliest stages of the Christian movement - a diversity that evades the conventional black-and-white categories of 'orthodoxy' and 'heresy'. In displaying a broad range of ancient expressions of faith and practice, it addresses the ongoing problem of religious absolutism or fundamentalism not by confronting it directly but by showing that religious traditions too are not immune from contingency. The point is taken for granted by scholars in the theology/religion field, but it is still widely overlooked or misunderstood in non-academic contexts.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>345900</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>1.
