The concept of disassembling polymers is new and can be described as macromolecular systems able todisintegrate into their building blocks through a domino-like reaction triggered by a single stimulus, such as a specificchemical reaction. The creation of a cross-linking network within the polymeric matrix would provide three dimensionalcavities where specific interactions with the drug molecule could be favoured. The choice of nanogels, as polymer format,is dictated by the great advantages derived, in terms of applications, by having such materials able to form colloidalsolutions.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project focusses on the development of a novel polymeric system, based on the self-disassembling approach, for the delivery of target molecules. Although the system is currently being developed for applications in the drug-delivery field, wider applications are envisaged in different areas, for example in agriculture, for the delivery of pesticides. This is a technology that has great potential and where patenting outcomes can be easily envisaged. This would in turn result in the development of potential start up companies, for its exploitation. Queen Mary has a dedicated unit, QM Innovation that provides extensive support and help on this regard. The impact of the project will clearly depend on the degree of success that will be achieved within the 18 months time frame and subsequently on the success in attracting more funding and disseminating the acquired knowledge. Initially the main impact will be on the knowledge, with the development of new techniques for synthesis and preparation of domino-disassembled cross-linked nanogels, with increased understanding of the key factors influencing drug uptake and release and also of the toxicity issues. If successful, there will also be considerable impact on people, as more skills are provided in this field, new researchers are trained and also additional groups may decide to approach this research field leading to new collaborative projects being initiated. If successful, the ultimate impact will be on society, with the main beneficiary being the people, gaining a better quality of life as a result of the new drug delivery systems. This would of course also improve their health, as less side effects are experienced and issues of toxicity are minimized. The data accrued over such long period of time would also influence policy makers and could lead to 'old' drug delivery platforms being banned or at least limited in their use.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>173862</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The work carried out in this project has allowed to achieve the synthesis of novel organic polymer based nanoparticles with sizes around 100nm with the potential to be used for drug delivery, as they can self-disassemble following a triggering event. These particles are prepared using a methodology called step-growth polymerisation, that allows to control the size and that is terminated by the addition of specific capping reagents.

The nanoparticles are cross-linked, that means that a three-dimensional network is generated.

The research has allowed us to demonstrate that we can prepare these nanoparticles in the form of nanogels, that can be isolated and then solubilised to give rise to stable colloidal solutions. The nanogels, under specific experimental conditions can have the capping group removed and this gives rise to a self-disassembling chain reaction that leads to the formation of only one type of small molecules.

This finding is particularly relevant in terms of drug delivery, because this system would potentially allow the risks associated with long term accumulation of the nanoparticles in the body and in the environment, therefore considerably minimising the risks of toxicity.

The velocity of the disassembling reaction is very important and can be controlled by the composition of the nanoparticles, in particular the amount of cross-linker used and the type of capping group utilised in the system.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The result of this research will have potential interest to the pharmaceutical industry, as there is currently a strong interest in developing novel drug delivery systems that can maximise the use of existing drugs, minimise side effects, open new routes to drug delivery. These nanoparticles will need to undergo accurate and detailed toxicology studies, where the impact on cell viability and cellular uptake need to be carefully evaluated in vitro. The development of novel drug delivery systems is an important target and the use of nanoparticles provides significant advantages, in particular the higher loading capacity and the ability to permeate cells and tissues to a major extent.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>752B33C5-4F60-4484-9B95-77BA743C3604</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-9612462278.09457477719a1e</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://resminilab.sbcs.qmul.ac.uk/research8.html</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/I014578/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>60EBB420-734E-4DB5-B0F2-65A1115A27F8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical synthesis</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E847DD9B-2053-4BC7-97A9-4213B185C968</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>0B9701E7-D17F-4963-82DA-B3926A65B50A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biological &amp; Medicinal Chem.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>063026C5-CD0B-48AB-82F3-6359499A95D4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials Synthesis &amp; Growth</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
