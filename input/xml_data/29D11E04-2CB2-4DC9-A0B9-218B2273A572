Yet, despite great progress in getting more children into school over the past decade, children from disadvantaged backgrounds are likely to experience poor quality of education limiting chances of fulfilling their learning potential. Children who face multiple disadvantages related to disability, poverty, gender, caste, religion or where they live, are amongst those least likely to be learning.

The project aims to identify strategies to raise learning outcomes for all children, regardless of their background. It is widely recognized that teachers are central to a child's educational experience. Yet, in low income countries, disadvantaged learners often face poor quality teaching: many teachers are recruited without having a basic subject knowledge themselves, receive inadequate training with limited attention to strategies to support children from diverse backgrounds, and weak incentives and poor teacher governance can lead to low motivation and high levels of teacher absenteeism. The research will, therefore identify which aspects of teaching are most important for improving all children's learning, and so inform governments on the strategies needed to support children who face multiple disadvantages. 

The research will be conducted in India and Pakistan, countries characteristic of other poor countries in terms of wide learning inequalities. India shows some advances in identifying strategies to tackle disadvantage, while Pakistan is similar to many other low income countries in not yet having such strategies.

Recognising that limited information is available on learning levels of children facing different forms of disadvantages who are not in school, the research will assess children both in the household and in schools. The focus of these tests will be on achievement of foundation skills of reading, writing, reasoning and numeracy that children are expected to acquire in primary school. This will be followed up with a test a year later in order to identify what learning gains have been made, and the extent to which these gains can be attributed to particular teacher characteristics, or other factors such as family background. The research will further provide an in-depth understanding of the problems that teachers face in supporting students from diverse backgrounds within the classroom, the teaching practices they adopt, and the kinds of support they need in order to make sure they are able to help all children fulfill their learning potential. 

The research will aim to make an important contribution to how measures of learning need to be enriched to include children with disabilities. In addition to adapting existing learning assessments for use in braille or using sign language, for example, it will also trial tests that measure other aspects of learning, such as self-esteem and peer relationships, taking into consideration how these could be adopted on a larger scale. 

This research will contribute to debates about the future of global goals on education after 2015 which are focusing on raising learning outcomes in ways that make sure no one is left behind. Achieving these goals will require better identification of the characteristics of children not learning, and the implementation of strategies within countries to strengthen the effectiveness of teaching in ways that address diversity in the classroom.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research will aim to have policy impact at two levels:
- Nationally, on the development of education policies and strategies to strengthen the effectiveness of teaching to support children facing multiple disadvantages (in particular related to disability, poverty and gender) within India and Pakistan.
- Internationally, on informing the setting of global development goals in education, and the development of appropriate assessment tools to measure progress towards these goals through measuring learning to ensure no one is left behind. 

As a result of this, the project is ultimately expected to have an impact for societies in low income countries by contributing to the improvement of learning outcomes for all children, regardless of their background, and particularly children with disabilities. 

The project will inform the development of national strategies by raising awareness of the problems, and identifying approaches to teaching that are most effective to make sure teachers are able to support children with diverse learning needs in the classroom. To achieve this, in India and Pakistan, developing country partners (CORD and IDEAS) will need to engage at sub-levels of the education system and also with selected politicians, government officials and researchers to discuss the importance of our research questions, create awareness of our research methods, discuss results of the research as they become available and have discussions on policy changes needed to address recommendations coming from the research. These discussions will need to occur throughout the period of the project, formally and informally, to not only keep the stakeholders informed, to build awareness of the importance for reform, and also to keep the issues on the agenda. Both country teams already have strong links with government officials and other key stakeholders, and substantial experience of such engagement from other research projects. 

In order to achieve the impact at the international level, an adivsory group, comprising representatives from international and national NGOs, multilateral agencies, teacher unions and academics will be established. This group will provide feedback at critical points during the research process, including during the inception and design phase, on draft outputs. They will also support the dissemination of the policy findings. Their role be vital to ensure the relevance and quality of the research.

The research will seek to inform the setting and implementation of global development goals in education, which are replacing the millennium development goals after 2015. DFID is actively engaged in helping to frame these goals, and so the research will be of direct relevance to their work. 

The research will be disseminated via academic conferences in education and development studies, policy workshops in India and Pakistan as well as the UK. At least two academic articles will be prepared from the research, and plans will also be in place to prepare a special issue of an education and development journal. In order to reach wider audiences in a timely fashion, policy briefs will be developed and posted on the project website. The intention is also to prepare a reader friendly booklet for teachers and teacher trainers on the findings of the research.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>457731</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Save the Children</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Save the Children: Research Training for Teacher Professional Development</gtr:description><gtr:id>D4E3D568-C644-4D36-AF4F-2BD29BC2D7BD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The collaboration resulted in the publication of a Guide on on Teacher Effectiveness Evaluation and Research Methods, prepared by the Research for Equitable Access and Learning (REAL) Centre for Save the Children.

The consultation involved around 50 policymakers, NGOs and grantees from the five ESRC-DFID Raising Learning Outcomes projects focusing on India. Those attending included the National University for Education Planning and Administration (NUEPA), USAID, DFID South Asia research hub, ASER India, and colleagues involved in the design and implementation of India's SSA education for all plan. In addition to members of our India country research team (Anuradha De and Meera Samson), Professor Pauline Rose (PI) and Dr Rabea Malik (Pakistan country partner) travelled to India for the event.

The event discussed ways to strengthen learning and teaching for the most disadvantaged in India's primary schools. It is widely accepted that teachers in these schools face a challenging task given the wide diversity of students in their classrooms. With achievements made in increasing enrolment and the Right to Education Act in India, children with disabilities are now being admitted into mainstream schools, making the task even more complex. The consultation addressed three related questions: 
? To what extent can teachers support children from disadvantaged backgrounds, with a particular focus on children with disabilities? 
? How can teachers effectively engage / teach all children in their classroom including those with multiple disadvantages? Does their own background and / or training prepare them for this in any way? 
? How can evidence on these issues be best communicated to stakeholders?

The consultation was particularly timely as India was in the process of gathering feedback on the draft Education Policy, which outcomes of the consultation fed into.

Issues raised at the consultation included the need for administrators and teachers to re-think what they mean by 'success' within education to ensure the system is inclusive. Research presented highlighted the importance of changing attitudes and beliefs of teachers towards children who are not learning, such as ones that assume that a child from a poor household or who has a disability is incapable of learning, reinforcing children's low self-esteem and lack of confidence in their abilities. At the same time, a shift in the mindset of how teachers are perceived in society, and the prejudices they often face, is also needed.

The consultation was both an opportunity for members of our TEACh research team to present initial findings on the project to policymakers and others, as well as to learn from them in ways that have helped to shape the design of the research in going forward. 

As a result of the consultation, an India-based advisory group for our research was established, including:
Dr Renu Singh, Country Director, Young Lives India
Poonam Batra, University of Delhi
Radhika Alkazi, Astha India (disability NGO).

Three blogs were written by members of the research team following the consultation (entered separately).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bc04d1a808b7.52706035</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.theimpactinitiative.net/blog/blog-teaching-learning-and-disadvantage-%E2%80%93-policy-practice</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>British Academy: Education Commission</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>08302948-DB81-45D5-A7FA-747D4B8C02B7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Pauline Rose (PI) and Monazza Aslam (research partner) were invited to a British Academy International Forum with the secretariat of the International Commission on Financing Global Education Opportunity led by Liesbet Steer on Tuesday 26 January, 2016.

The event was organized by Leadership for Learning: the Cambridge network (LfL) in partnership with Open Society Foundations (OSF), Education International (EI), and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and brought together practitioners, researchers and policy-makers committed to enhancing the development of the teaching profession. Working with invited delegates from around the world, the seminars aimed to strengthen the discourse on the future of teaching and teachers. 

In the context of the development of indicators for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the event provided the opportunity for open and frank debates drawing on diverse perspectives on what should be measured with respect to teaching and learning. Drawing on TEACh research, Professor Rose presented evidence to show the importance of measuring basic literacy and numeracy and also showed the difficulty of tracking progress on some of the proposed measures for teachers in the SDG framework. Other colleagues raised concerns about narrowing the focus in education to literacy and numeracy.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bc3451f2ea66.26122828</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.educ.cam.ac.uk/centres/lfl/projects/seminarseries/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Oslo Education Week: Leaving no one behind in education</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6A3DA080-1EC2-4C5F-9BCF-39B694ED4B43</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Professor Pauline Rose (PI) was invited to participate in the Oslo Education Week event on 'Leaving Noone Behind' which took place on 17 June 2016. The event was attended by a wide range of senior policymakers, NGOs and practitioners including the Global Partnership for Education, UNESCO Institute for Statistics, Education International (confederation of teacher unions), UNICEF, aid donors, amongst others.

Professor Rose participated in a plenary panel on: From the Perspective of Equity: What are key elements that can improve teaching and learning? 

She was also discussant on a side panel on 'how to reach the most vulnerable children with a focus on disability', with a focus on the potential for including identification of children with disabilities in Education Management Information Systems, drawing on lessons from the Washington Group questions on disability. This provided the opportunity for Professor Rose to share experience of using these questions in our ESRC-DFID TEACh survey. Participants were keen to hear about this experience, and to know that it was possible for questions on disability to be included in such surveys in a systematic way.

The event resulted in a report (that Professor Rose was asked to help to draft together with the organisers of the event - Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Norway; NORAD and Education International) of key messages that was sent to the Education Commission whose Learning Generation Report was under preparation at the time. Three key messages were put for the Education Commission:
- Counting the invisible: the need for better data for inclusion

Commissioner of the International Commission on Financing Global Education Opportunity, Dr Amel Karboul, presented key highlights from the Education Commission Learning Generation Report, with Alice Albright (CEO, Global Partnership for Education) identifying implications for the Global Partnership for Education. Based on research by the REAL Centre, Pauline Rose highlighted the importance of the Report's message on 'progressive universalism', presenting evidence to show the importance of redistributive spending towards the early years of education to achieve this. Participants at the event showed a particular interest in approaches being undertaken with the ESRC-DFID project to assess learning beyond literacy and numeracy, in ways that are intended to include children from diverse backgrounds, including those with disabilities.

The event was closed by Tanya Barron, CEO of Plan International UK, representing the Global Campaign for Education UK. The event was attended by around 60 people, including MPs, NGOs and academics. 

Stephen Twigg, Chair of the International Development Committee which was undertaking an inquiry into DFID's work on leaving noone behind in education attended the event, and highlighted the importance of the work presented by Professor Rose for the inquiry.

In the article, Dr Bari reports that 'The Punjab Examination Commission (PEC) results for Grade 5 and 8 illustrate the poor levels of learning in most children. ASER surveys also show that Grade 5 children have difficulty doing Grade 2-level work'. He notes that the problem is particularly acute for girls. Given that many children are not learning in school, he suggest that parents would have a valid reason to ask 'Why should children then come to school?'

The article asks: 'What should a 15-year-old who dropped out of Grade 4 a few years back do now? Should he or she try to enrol in a regular school and interact with students who are 10 years old? Most schools will not allow that. But even if they did, this would not be the solution to the problem. It will create disruptions in regular classes and will not be good for the child either. More importantly, if the child could come to a regular school, he or she might not have dropped out in the first place.' Dr Bari suggests: 'Instead of spending money distributing laptops or setting up expensive Daanish schools or even giving five chickens to each female student in school (to teach kitchen skills), a support programme that allows second chances to youth could have significant benefits for the millions looking for such opportunities. These opportunities could consist of pathways that allow the youth to complete their education and/or acquire vocational training after attaining some minimum level of education.'

The blog was an outcome of the Policy Dialogue organised by IDEAS country partner in November 2016, and was shared by participants at the event. 

The blog highlights some key points from the Policy Dialogue including that 'policy makers today see the benefits of having information available to them for planning and policy design - a preference reiterated during a policy dialogue held recently in Lahore. They're keen to - and in some ways they have already - put in place mechanisms that make available data on enrollment, teacher attendance, student attendance, school expenditures, etc. Digital dashboards highlighting key indicators and road maps tracking progress across regions are examples of such mechanisms.' It further highlights the importance of learning assessment data being used 'in a way that empowers teachers and school leaders, and enables them to change their practice willingly rather than being utilized for high-stakes accountability'.

These key issues have been important in informing the analysis of our data on the TEACh project, and in our on-going dialogue with the DFID Pakistan office.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bc141bc8e528.95840935</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://devpakistan.com/2016/12/11/understanding-and-responding-to-disadvantage-in-education/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Blog: post2015.org - stepping stones</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7E18E9AA-7872-49FA-9D9B-280F095C5C3C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Blog by Pauline Rose and Ben Alcott on Overseas Development Institute post-2015 website: 'A stepping-stones approach to leaving no one behind in learning'.

Each of the panels included a mix of researchers, policymakers and NGOs and engaged an evidence-based debate on the design of learning assessments for inclusion. Panels directly drew on TEACh research including participation by project members Dr Monazza Aslam, Professor Pauline Rose, Dr Nidhi Singal and Professor Anna Vignoles. The event was attended by around 100 participants.

Kevin Watkins (CEO of Save the Children) opened the event by reminding the audience that leaving no one behind will not be straightforward. To achieve the sustainable development goals will require concerted action, better data to hold policymakers to account, and avoidance of policy fads. This set the scene for insightful presentations and discussions on different approaches to measuring learning to inform policy, and warnings about what different types of assessment data can and cannot be used for. 

A special focus was given to including children with disabilities in assessments of learning, and the potential of innovations in types of learning to assess - notably taking account of measuring how schooling influences self-esteem, self-confidence and attitudes to learning which should be seen as outcomes of education in their own right; as well as new approaches to collecting data on reasoning ability via open education resources.

These discussions have helped to shape the design of our TEACh project, while also informing other key stakeholders of how to ensure learning assessments are inclusive.

The article draws on discussions from the consultation on India's draft education policy with academics and policymakers in Delhi organised by our India country partners. The article highlights three actions 'to ensure all children get to school, remain in school and learn while in school are not receiving enough attention: making education inclusive for children from marginalised backgrounds; making school assessments focus more on systems than test scores and; including teachers in the policy design process.' It further refers to the open consultation on India's draft education policy which was available for comment to the public, and suggests that this would be a valuable approach for consultation on Pakistan's policy.

In the article, Dr Bari notes that school heads were previously appointed on the basis of seniority, and now on the basis of level of education. However, he notes the need to go beyond this: 'There is no real effort on the part of the respective departments of staff development to identify potential leaders; there are no effective trainings on leadership development/management and there is no effective recognition for being a leader as well.'

The article followed a visit to schools as part of our ESRC-DFID TEACh project and a Policy Dialogue held in Lahore in November 2016 (see separate entry).

In the article, Dr Bari highlights the dire conditions of some of the schools, and notes: 'Even in these trying circumstances the four teachers were doing their best to educate these children. The system could help them more and the results could get even better.' He focuses in particular on the importance of supporting teachers in managing diversity in the classroom: 'Any group of children would have a certain diversity of abilities among them: some would be quick learners, others would take longer, some would be more coordinated than others, some would have a better memory, some would be good at physical activities, and so on. Teachers have to be not only aware of this, they have to make sure all children learn despite the diversity and, more importantly, they have to ensure that the diversity works to the advantage of the class they teach.'

Specifically, it sought to identify how: a) our evidence can respond to knowledge gaps needed to inform the challenges facing Pakistan's education system, b) our findings can be best communicated to policy stakeholders to influence change; c) our research tools can benefit the work of governments and other development actors. The activities also aimed to pave the way for deeper engagement once the results are finalised at the end of the project life-cycle. The event took place in November 2016 in Lahore, Pakistan, organised by our research partner, the Institute of Development and Economic Alternatives (IDEAS), with Dr Faisal Bari and Dr Rabea Malik. Professor Pauline Rose (PI) travelled to Pakistan for the event.

The event was attended by 31 invited participants, including senior government officials from the Punjab Department of School Education and Department for Special Education, DFID Pakistan, World Bank as well as other key policy stakeholders and NGOs involved in evidence-based service delivery and advocacy. A headteacher from one of the schools included in our survey also attended the event. Key points raised at the event included:
Key points with respect to the link between evidence and policy impact included: 
? The need to support government to develop its capacity for using data to inform policy interventions and design. 
? The potential for an adaptation of our TEACh instruments to be used by government to inform effective teacher practices.
? The importance of the research to recognise the strategies that teachers are already trying to adopt to support disadvantaged learners, and build recommendations on this.
? The benefits of identifying feasible, concrete entry points through which the evidence from the project can have an impact - for example, linking of Special Education department and the School Education Department for policy discussions; and draw on the experience of TEACh tools to include identifiers of disability in data collected through Education Management Information Systems.

Participants reported that they particularly appreciated the detailed discussion on the research methods used in the TEACh project, the discussion of language as a marker of exclusion in the classroom, the 'range of voices' at the dialogue i.e. representation from a variety of organisations (including teachers), and that the dialogue was being conducted during the study for interim feedback and not at the end of the study as is normally done. 

The Special Secretary of the Punjab noted that the: 'TEACh team is doing valuable work in Punjab and it's much appreciated'. In a blog after the event, Baela Jamil (head of ASER Pakistan, and Commissioner for The International Commission on Financing Global Education Opportunity) wrote: 'the research program on Teaching Effectively All Children (TEACh) is a timely initiative providing evidence on effective teaching strategies to raise learning for those at risk of being left behind. Last month, at a roundtable on &amp;quot;Teaching Learning and Disadvantage&amp;quot; hosted by the Institute of Development and Economic Alternatives (IDEAS)and the Research for Equitable Access and Learning (REAL) Centre at the University of Cambridge, some 20 participants discussed emerging findings from the TEACh research. The senior representative from the Government of Punjab's School Education Department confessed there is little understanding of the learning needs of children with disabilities within the mainstream schools, let alone counting such children who are in school or planning for them in the teaching and learning processes.' (http://educationcommission.org/voices/learns-not-examining-choices-including-excluded/)

A number of follow up engagements and meetings were organised following the policy dialogue to continue work with stakeholders on inclusive education in Punjab. These include:
- Members of the TEACh team have been invited to play an advisory role with Adam Smith International which is leading on technical support to the Punjab Government (funded by DFID); and with the Special Education Department on strategies for inclusive education
- Members of the TEACh team have been invited to participate on a Committee in the Punjab Province to inform their design of a teacher perception survey 
- Members of the team were invited to present findings and insights from TEACh on a panel on Priority Actions for the SDGs and Leave No One Behind Agenda in South Asia at a conference organised by Sustainable Development Policy Institute in December, 2017
- Meetings have been arranged with the Deputy Secretary Education Reform in Punjab, Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund, UNICEF (Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys), and the Punjab Board of Statistics and the Education Initiative. 

In addition, an Advisory Group was set up as an outcome of the policy dialogue. The purpose of this Advisory Group is to continue to guide the link between our evidence and policy, with the aim of facilitating impact from the project's findings. The Group comprises participants who were particularly engaged and active in the policy dialogue, with a mix of different types of stakeholders. Membership includes:
? Ed Davies, Senior Education Adviser, DFID Pakistan Education Policy Team 
? Imran Sikandar Baloch, Special Secretary, School Education Department, Punjab), Pakistan
? Farooq Naseer, Associate Professor, Department of Economics, Lahore University of Management Sciences
? Riaz Kamlani, Vice President, The Citizens Foundation

In response to questions from MPs present at the inquiry, she further highlighted the importance of DFID focusing on this area in its work, in particular to ensure all children, regardless of their background, could achieve basic literacy and numeracy. Drawing on the research, she highlighted in particular the need to focus attention on children from the poorest households, especially girls and children with disabilities who are often the most disadvantaged in education. The event was livestreamed, and a transcript of the oral evidence was produced.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58baae5931cfd9.10970650</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/international-development-committee/dfids-work-on-education-leaving-no-one-behind/oral/47513.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Inclusion of disability questions in survey instruments</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Asia</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D93BB05E-9015-4415-AB22-F6F1172E071B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Nidhi Singal (co-I), Monazza Aslam (research partner) and Pauline Rose (PI) have worked with ASER Pakistan - a citizen-led large scale survey collecting data on basic literacy and numeracy - to include identifiers on disability. As a result of this, evidence is now available on the extent to which children with disabilities have a chance to learn compared with those without disabilities.

Similarly, Nidhi Singal and Pauline Rose have also worked with a large NGO working on girls' education in Africa - Camfed - to include identifiers of disability. As a result data have been collected in Tanzania and Zimbabwe for a similar purpose.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d5d6214104b2.22879614</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Influence of International Commission on Financing Global Education Opportunity - progressive universalism</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0F7B4911-8790-4123-9920-35E83EBF878A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Building on the team's secondary data analysis within our project, members prepared a background paper for the Education Commission's report on 'Overcoming Inequalities Within Countries to Achieve Global Convergence in Learning'. This paper was heavily cited in the Education Commission's report (chaired by Gordon Brown, with high profile commissioners including politicians and business people). Our work notably influenced the message on 'progressive universalism' which identifies the importance of prioritising investment in the early years to achieve inclusive education. Professor Rose (PI) was an advisor to the Education Commission report. She has led the organisation of three events at the British Academy with academics and policymakers working together to identify solutions to progressive universalism. In addition, members of the project organised an event in Cambridge to discuss the Report's findings with a focus on 'putting evidence to work' with panellists including the Report's director (Dr Liesbet Steer), and representatives of DFID, Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the World Bank. Overall, this engagement has significantly resulted in conceptual impact related to orientating a focus amongst international policymakers towards focusing on prioritising investment to the early years of education to overcome inequalities in education.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58a09923b96581.01579765</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://educationcommission.org/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Citation in 2016 UNICEF State of the World's Children</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4AAF9591-4BAF-4B93-84BF-A687B6FF7312</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Kevin Watkins (CEO, Save the Children), lead author of the 2016 UNICEF State of the World's Children Report commented in relation to our contribution:
'As lead author of the UNICEF State of the World's Children Report (SOWC 2016), I drew extensively on REAL research into age and grade inequalities in learning outcomes in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. The research combined path-breaking data analysis with practical policy insights. The education section of SOWC drew almost entirely on REAL analysis.'

This contribution drew on secondary data analysis undertaken in relation to our TEACh research project, highlighting that learning inequalities start early on and so need to tackled within the early years of education.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ba8ca2e59a00.83164858</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.unicef.org/sowc2016/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>The research team has designed a number of new research tools aimed at investigating the effectiveness of teaching and learning, with a focus on addressing diversity. Survey instruments include:
- household survey, with a focus on attitudes towards education of children from different backgrounds (including girls and children with disabilities)
- teacher survey, with a particular focus on addressing inclusion of children from poor households, girls and children with disabilities (quantitative and qualitative instruments)
- classroom observation schedule for observing interactions between teachers and students from different backgrounds (with a focus on children with disabilities)
- assessment of literacy and numeracy (drawing on existing ASER and Young Lives instruments)
- assessment of self- and peer-relations, using pictures for inclusion of children who are not literate
- tactile version of non-verbal reasoning tool to include all children, including those with visual impairments

Innovations in the design of these tools include:
- identifying children with disabilities in learning assessments
