This diversity offers a challenge which can be satisfactorily met only by mounting a full - scale re-examination of the Minstrelsy and its context. 
The editor, Sigrid Rieuwerts, and her associates, will aim to bring the results of recent ballad scholarship and current insights on literacy, morality and cultural memory to bear on the contents of the work, and also to illuminate the cultural milieu in which the &amp;quot;ballads in print&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;ballads as sung&amp;quot; had their life. 
This edition will therefore include ballad tunes wherever possible and evaluate both parts of a double tradition - the literary and antiquarian ferment that surrounded Scott's creative genius and the cultural memory that transmitted the ballads from generation to generation. Special consideration will be given to the impact of the Minstrelsy in Germany through the study of its reception and translation during Scott's lifetime. 
We also aim to create a user-friendly website, containing visual images, audio files of ballad performances, contextual discussion and commentary. 
Our 21st-century approach to Scott's Minstrelsy will not only secure the first historical critical edition of one of the key texts in Scottish literature but will also lay the foundation for future use in media and education.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>181617</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation to Mark Llewellyn, AHRC - Katherine Campbell and Sigrid Rieuwerts, University of Edinburgh</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8035DBB7-9B3C-4446-BC73-E1CDA16EDF01</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The talk sparked questions and discussion, particularly concerning how the project was being operated in a practical sense on this joint-funded programme (AHRC/DFG).

The Minstrelsy is a complex work of nearly a hundred poems and songs, many of them containing fascinating narratives of death, murder and abductions. In his extended essays on history and the supernatural, Scott gives the background to the ballad narratives - opening up a window into the life of the Scottish Borders around 1800. The edition presents Scott's original text in a new critical way, and also tells the stories behind the stories, naming the sources and singers, identifying places and bringing alive the cultural background. For the first time, the vitality of the Scottish culture and narratives of the Borders are brought to light through the research undertaken on this iconic text in Scotland's cultural memory.
The extraordinary range of Scott's interests have been a challenge and the work on this will contribute to the wide range of the appeal of the finished edition. 
The edition fills a gap in three key areas of Scottish literature and culture.
(1) Although most of Scott's work has been given full literary attention, this work, which laid the foundation of his literary career, has not been allowed to contribute to our overall understanding.
(2) Although ballads and songs have been a central element in Scottish culture, Scott's Minstrelsy has lain outside the fold as a result of no critical edition being available.
(3) The inclusion of the music in the edition broadens its reach, and we have been very fortunate in being able to use the tunes from the Sophia Scott manuscript, as sung in the drawing room at Abbotsford. This has previously been unavailable to scholarship. 
Close attention to the Minstrelsy reveals the roots of Scott's massive impact on Romantic perceptions and on the creation of an imagined Scotland. 
The edition highlights the dynamic of Scott's development between his earliest attempts at poetry and the appearance of his novels.
An important feature of the edition is that it settles the question of authenticity in the case of each ballad by showing the relationship of Scott's published versions to the sources and parallels available to him.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The educational website is already been used by schools and in university teaching. We plan to broaden its audience and its reach through an online forum and blog which will be hosted on the University of Edinburgh website commencing in November 2014, managed by Katherine Campbell and run by Kaye McAlpine and Lucy MacRae. We also hope to interest Education Scotland in the site. These initiatives, we believe, are helping to foster an interest in Scott's life and work, particularly amongst young people. 
 
The critical edition we hope will form the foundation of much future debate and scholarship on Scott's Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border, and on Scott's role more widely. Until now, the lack of such an edition has prohibited this kind of discussion from taking place.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>68EFD27F-D627-4705-9559-022BB3EE5CED</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5460cab622d2c0.28091613</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.walterscott.eu/education</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>EEF2013C-78F2-48A4-9B86-247D6448B89B</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Edinburgh Edition of Walter Scott's 'Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border', 3 volume set</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/17308e0964f8a0284e6ce700225331cc"><gtr:id>17308e0964f8a0284e6ce700225331cc</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rieuwerts, S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>545f841dc8d595.22316424</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E23BD9F0-7EFA-4BDB-917A-0B2EDBBFBBAB</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Medieval and the Modern in the Fairy Verse-Narratives published in Scott's Minstrelsy</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d32b84cc87ba849a0453fed8d26491ff"><gtr:id>d32b84cc87ba849a0453fed8d26491ff</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lyle, E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>5460cfa4a8d858.69305052</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AC157D48-1B64-4154-B5D1-D13BBD28E4C9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Thomas the Rhymer and the Gift of Poetry</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Proceedings of Moscow Lermontov Society</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d32b84cc87ba849a0453fed8d26491ff"><gtr:id>d32b84cc87ba849a0453fed8d26491ff</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lyle, E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>m_417006968213ba3e1c</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8D4EA1C2-AF0E-4411-A071-50168A3E27B4</gtr:id><gtr:title>Walter Scott's Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border and the dynamics of cultural memory</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/0589b0a6261c7d2bb9f6dda7b627f4e4"><gtr:id>0589b0a6261c7d2bb9f6dda7b627f4e4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>MacRae Lucy Alison</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545f86cd793ab7.21473625</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BDB00093-99FE-4F86-821C-AAA0E7EC4F32</gtr:id><gtr:title>Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border Education Website</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/fc24ed4a15485edb7e311c0b448b762f"><gtr:id>fc24ed4a15485edb7e311c0b448b762f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>McAlpine, K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545f835d547e68.51477425</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I500596/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
