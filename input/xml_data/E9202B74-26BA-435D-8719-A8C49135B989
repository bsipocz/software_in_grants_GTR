Home Technology</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/K002457/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Thermal efficiency retrofit options, appliance upgrades and on-site renewables represent a significant opportunity to deliver energy demand reductions to UK homes. The potential to reduce thermal heat losses through insulation and airtightness (in particular in pre-1980s housing), upgrade the household appliance stock (using the latest energy saving models) and integrated on-site renewables and microgeneration (developing a 'prosumer' culture and reducing energy bills) still remains largely unrealised. There are a number of challenges in providing advice for retrofit solutions to consumers which will promote behaviour change and influence purchasing decisions. Currently consumer information is based on standardised methodologies for nominal house types and the resulting predictions of energy savings have minimal resemblance to reality where the thermal efficiency of the dwelling, efficiency of heating system and appliances, occupancy, user behaviour and preferences will have a significant impact on the effectiveness and uptake of retrofit measures. One solution is to provide consumers with personalised, accurate and trustworthy predictions of energy saving measures which are calibrated and tailored to their dwelling and living patterns, presented in a format to engage and promote action. 

This proposal will facilitate a widespread uptake of retrofit measures in UK homes by implementing a holistic approach to providing consumers with personalised, tailored retrofit advice delivered using methods to maximise consumer engagement. Smart Home technology provides a unique opportunity to use real-time measurements, advanced data analytics, digital signal processing and communications techniques, novel visualisation, semantic web and cloud computing technologies to generate advice at different levels of abstraction for informed and justified decision making. The Smart Home concept is currently gaining significant momentum and new developments in open systems, simple use and installation features (ie plug and play), mobile access (ie Smart Phones) and connectivity have brought the concept to the attention of energy companies, ICT companies and appliance manufacturers. The IBM vision of a Smart(er) Home gives three characteristics: 1) Instrumented (sensors and automation of household activities); 2) Interconnected (communication between devices and wider networks - allowing remote access and control of devices); and 3) Intelligent ('the ability to make decisions based on data, leading to better outcomes'). Smart Homes provide consumers with more control over their homes and energy systems and, importantly, how their energy demand and costs can be reduced through interventions. 

This proposal brings together a multi-disciplinary team of building, ICT, energy, design and user experts to develop a personalised decision support platform for building envelope retrofits, heating system and appliance replacement purchases, and on-site renewables integration. This will deliver a step-change in the provision and accuracy of retrofit advice to UK householders leading to a low-energy and low-carbon future housing stock. The outcomes will be of benefit to: energy, ICT, embedded systems and telecommunication companies developing technology and business models for Smart Home services; consumers to lower their energy bills and improve the safety, security and comfort of their homes; building component, boiler and appliance manufacturers developing the next generation of low-energy products; and policy makers for new insights into innovative approaches to meeting the security, affordability and carbon reduction aspirations of the UK energy system.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The large-scale retrofitting of the UK building stock has the potential to impact on the three aspects of the nation's 'energy trilemma': 1) a reduction in carbon emissions arising from energy supply, as the building stock energy demand is reduced; 2) improved security of supply, as reduced energy demand results in less imports of energy supplies required; 3) improved affordability for consumers, as less energy is needed to fulfil comfort and user requirements. The work and findings of the REFIT project, by advancing the purchase and take-up of retrofit options across the stock, will therefore have substantial benefits for many stakeholders within UK society and the UK economy. Societal benefits occur once retrofit measures have been purchased and installed, through mitigation of climate change effects and improved energy security due to the energy demand reductions. Economic benefits arise at the installation stage through job creation for skilled installers for retrofit measures. The increased purchasing of retrofit materials and technologies will have economic benefits for manufacturers and retailers, with a steep demand anticipated for products including insulation, boilers, heating controls, low-energy appliances and on-site microgeneration. Large-scale retrofitting of the building stock will also provide tangible benefits to householders and consumers. Energy bills will be reduced with potential to decrease the number of households in fuel poverty in the UK. In addition, by improving building fabric and heat loss characteristics, homes will become warmer in winter improving thermal comfort levels, in particular for the more vulnerable households in society.

The initial beneficiaries of the research will be the REFIT project partners. REFIT has engaged the support of ICT companies (IBM, Thales), Smart Technology providers (Sentec, Green Energy Options, RWE Power), equipment manufacturers (National instruments), building research and consultancy organisations (BSRIA, Adapt, the National Refurbishment Centre) and industry network organisations (COMIT, FIATECH). Impacts with external stakeholders will be maximised through the COMIT and FIATECH members (including UK and US construction companies, ICT companies and leading universities) and through REFIT project conferences. In particular a high profile REFIT Colloquium will be held in London in the third year of the project to disseminate the immediate findings and identify new routes to achieving academic, commercial and policy impacts. 

The REFIT project will develop and trial a new approach to the generation and provision of retrofit advice to householders, specifically by using Smart Home technology both as the enabler to generate personalised, tailored retrofit information and as the means to disseminate this information to householders. Dissemination will be integrated across the project activities and will actively promote impact across several sectors. The beneficiaries include: academic and research organisations developing and evaluating Smart Homes and Smart Technology applications; energy companies seeking novel energy services and customer retention; appliance manufacturers through new performance diagnostic services to promote appliance upgrades; ICT companies developing novel business opportunities through software and hardware applications for new services; policy makers through the evaluation of Smart Homes as an energy demand reduction mechanism to achieve legislative targets; and consumers through access to better information on which to base purchasing decisions and operational strategies for making substantial saving to energy bills.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>740727</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Teddinet</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>TEDDINET</gtr:description><gtr:id>E97066A5-EF8D-41BF-B690-587FB78ECA83</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentations and networking opportunities.

The relevance of the work will continue to grow as more Smart Meters are installed and as Smart Meter data streams - via the DCC - become available. The number of market-ready Smart Home products and manufacturers has been steadily increasing since the project's inception, with many well-known brands now marketing their own Smart Home brands. As Smart Home market penetration grows, the relevance and potential impact routes of the project increases. 

Smart Meter datasets tend to deliver long, thin streams of data, with relatively little metadata on the dwelling or household they are associated with. Such datasets are becoming more commonplace through the installation of Smart Meters by the energy providers, and through recent OFGEM and other Smart Meter trials. The REFIT project studied the next step in this trend, by considering multiple data streams from Smart Home sensors (over 60 per home), as well as Smart Meter data, and future highly detailed metadata, including 3D geometry of homes and room-by-room surveying. One of the first impacts of this has been the development of a new data model (expressed as an XML schema), capable of holding survey data of this complexity and allowing to changes over time to be recorded. The data model, along with the data itself, has been made available to several companies, academics, data scientists and presented at Smart Meter workshops. The approach is gradually gaining traction as a new paradigm for mapping and storing Smart Home survey data. A second impact development is the use of the data to answer policy questions. The impact of advanced heating systems on occupant heating practices and energy demand is being explored through on going publications. The potential of using Smart Meter data to infer building thermal performance characteristics has been investigated in a PhD study and presented at a specially organised BEIS workshop. These, as well as other, applications of the REFIT dataset to develop new methods and techniques for utilising Smart Home data for economic and social benefits will be exploited further over the coming years and new impact routes actively sought.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>806119F8-73E2-412C-A546-F146D6516386</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56de75f9ec0125.72287489</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Energy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The REFIT project was a 3.5-year research project funded by Research Councils UK. It was one of the 22 research projects in the Transforming Energy Demand through Digital Innovation (TEDDI) research programme, funded by a joint initiative of the Research Councils UK Energy Programme and Digital Economy Programme. The project ran from May 2012 to October 2015 and employed five full-time university researchers and eight academic staff. The work was a collaboration between Loughborough University, the University of Strathclyde and the University of East Anglia, together with a number of stakeholder partners. The REFIT project explored the Smart Home concept in the UK context to determine the potential for Smart Home technologies to help with energy saving and energy management for UK homes. We focussed in particular on retrofit technologies and supporting households with new retrofit advice. We installed existing off-the-shelf Smart Home products into 20 homes in this study. This included the Smart Home product range manufactured by RWE and imported from Germany, the VERA product range, the CurrentCost product range and the British Gas HIVE heating system. Our work focussed on a small and detailed study of 20 households. This choice was made so that we could observe how Smart Home technologies would integrate into a real world setting of family lives and existing buildings. The small sample allowed us to carry out very detailed measurements and interviews that provide unique insights into Smart Home technologies. We calculated metrics relating to how heating controls are used on a daily basis, identifying how they change over time and assessing how the changes link to external weather conditions. We found that timer settings changed most days, suggesting that occupants override their timer settings according to their daily routines. Regression analysis showed that some of the variation in heating duration was related to the weather. This work was a significant step forward in understanding how homes are heated during transition periods between summer, when little or no heating is used, and winter, when heating is used every day. Much less variation was observed in room thermostat settings, boiler supply temperature and radiator thermostat settings. Recent advances in smart heating controls provided an opportunity to assess how closely room temperatures follow the temperatures set by occupants. Sensor data was used to identify periods when energy savings were possible, and to develop methods to achieve these energy savings by incorporating this learning into advanced heating controls in the future. This highlighted three ways that improved controls could save energy: i) adjusting for heating system characteristics to minimise times when temperatures do not follow occupant settings (overshooting the set point, or lagging behind heating controls); ii) identifying times of excessive heat loss - such as leaving a window open in a room; and iii) identifying times of unoccupied heating - when the heating is in use but the room is unoccupied. A data-driven lumped parameter model of domestic buildings was developed to explore the potential for energy modelling which matched the real world measured data. Results for a case study building showed that an improved fit to the measured data can be achieved by varying the initial model parameter values of capacitance (up to 78%), resistance (-46%) and effective window area (-59%). This highlighted the importance of having a reference set of parameters based on the known physical characteristics of the building and informs the choice of future building survey design. The installation of the smart home technology in the homes raised a number of issues from the perspective of the homeowner. The initial expectations of the homeowners were that the smart home technologies would increase comfort, convenience and security, and reduce energy costs. In particular, they expected the smart home technologies to enable them to make energy-related cost savings by controlling their heating more accurately and identifying energy cost savings. The reality after they had lived with the smart home kit for about a year was somewhat different. They were initially concerned about the aesthetics, but quickly got used to having the kit in the home. They did manage to control their heating successfully, but stressed how ease of use was really important. There were some installation issues, for example radiator control valves not fitting all of the radiators. The motorised radiator valves themselves were found to be noisy and intrusive. At an overall level it was found that although there were expected and realised benefits, these were in part counteracted by the challenges involved in using the technology and integrating it with lifestyle in the home. The project carried out an iterative design and evaluation process to investigate how smart home data (including smart metering) can be presented to households to help them make energy-related retrofit decisions. There was initially little understanding of consumption, the relative costs of electricity and gas, or the units (KWh) involved. Householders were interested in the individual running costs of appliances, and the baseline electricity load. The patterns of use of energy over time were only meaningful to households when they could be put into context. Additional information was needed such as occupancy and outdoor temperatures. Trends over time were interesting to householders, particularly if they could be related to key changes that had taken place. Comparisons of a households energy use with other similar households were useful, but these had to include both type of house and nature of the household, to ensure they were similar. Despite increased interest and more informed decisions, there was only limited impact on what householders intended to do and actually did, in relation to retrofit. Simply providing more information to householders (even in a highly engaging manner) did not necessarily result in increased energy-related retrofit - there are a range of barriers which limit the options which would be considered. These include: upfront cost and cost/payback times, disruption (eg. underfloor heating and insulation), lack of understanding (eg. with microheat generation and ground source heat pumps), and measures which would be difficult to apply to their particular house. Outlines for ten potential energy related services were developed, that are based on smart home data. These are: 1 Appliance Performance Monitoring - Using disaggregated electricity consumption to identify when individual appliances are failing or becoming less efficient; 2 Safety and Security Alerting - Using various sensors in and around the home to monitor and alert when safety and/or security is being breached; 3 Optimising Design of Heating Systems - Using temperature and energy sensors to analyse heating performance and recommend design changes to heating systems; 4 Optimising Control of Heating Systems - This service would use sensors such as room temperature, occupancy, and activity levels, to identify how well heating system control is set up, and how it can be optimised to balance comfort and cost; 5 Understanding Appliance Consumption - Detailed monitoring of consumption by appliances, and comparing this to similar households, to highlight where consumption is 'normal', and where easy cost savings should be possible; 6 Community-based Services - Sharing information on energy consumption within a local community, in order to help members of the community (eg. vulnerable isolated individuals) to learn from collective experience, and promote bulk energy buying or generation in a community; 7 Utility Cost Comparison - Detailed monitoring of energy usage and direct comparison of actual costs of various energy suppliers, leading to recommendations or automatic and dynamic switching of energy supplier; 8 Training and Awareness Raising - To target three key groups to change attitudes: older households who may have time and motivation to consider energy usage and their lifestyles, younger adults who are just starting to live independently, and school children to instil early messages. Capitalise on windows of opportunity to bring about changes in energy related behaviour; 9 Energy supply and demand management - This would help householders manage their energy supply and demand by taking into account the times of day, or days of the week where energy is cheap or free (eg. through micro-generation) and helping to schedule appliance use accordingly; 10 Green Deal 'Plus' - To build on the advice that was given through the Green Deal, by incorporating an energy audit aspect - with a householder-consultation process - to provide more contextually relevant advice to the householder. The project used a range of co-design methods to help householders understand their personal energy data. It was possible to identify a number of successful methodological factors: (1) Using priming materials to help people think about and convey what their homes mean to them, how they aspire to live and what they would like to improve; (2) Continually and actively involving the households in the design process and keeping them immersed in the complex and intangible problem space so they were regularly thinking about key issues and possible solutions; (3) Viewing the householders as 'experts of their own lived experiences' - experiences that we must tap into if we are to design better retrofit advice and future services; (4) Using a range of creative visual prompts and activities to help people grasp and understand intangible or complex concepts; (5) Bringing different householders with different experiences together with technology specialists, to help us design and develop service concepts.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings are of interest to organisations which promote energy savings in the home and who run energy saving initiatives.
