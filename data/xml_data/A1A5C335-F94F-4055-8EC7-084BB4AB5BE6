This is normally because the abstract was not required at the time of proposal submission, but may be because it included sensitive information such as personal details.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>A significant cause of renal allograft failure is ?chronic rejection? (CR), the pathophysiology of which is incompletely understood. Some patients (20-30%) develop anti-HLA antibodies before CR and it has been assumed that these antibodies cause the rejection. However, this assumption may not be correct. This project will clarify the relevance of anti-HLA antibodies after kidney transplantation, determine their relationship with CR, and undertake a pilot study of anti-CD20 therapy in these patients. Hypotheses: a) In CR, development of anti-HLA antibodies may indicate two types of damage, both linked by a role for B cells in pathophysiology; the antibody may be causing chronic humoral rejection or it may be a marker for a T cell-mediated process, with B cells playing a critical role in the presentation of graft antigens. b) However, anti-HLA antibodies may also be associated with transplant ?accommodation? - this, rather than CR, is expected if patients develop low-titre anti-HLA antibodies and maintain effective mechanisms to regulate indirect T cell alloresponses. b) Targeting B cells using anti-CD20 therapy in patients with CR but not accommodation may help prevent graft loss. Aims and Methods: a) I will define, using FlowPRA , a subgroup of renal transplant patients who have anti-HLA atibodies and deteriorating graft function. Blood will be analysed to determine antibody specificity, and to assess whether B lymphocytes play a role as antigen presenting cells in indirect T cell alloresponses. A renal biopsy will be analysed for features of CR, C4d staining, B cell/plasma cell infiltration and T cell mediated rejection. b) A small number of patients with anti-HLA antibodies are expected to have stable graft function. Differences between these patients and those in group a) will be examined. In particular, the titres of antibodies and strength of indirect T cell responses will be analysed. A long-term follow-up study in these patients will be initiated. c) with anti-HLA antibodies and deteriorating graft function will be offered anti-CD20 therapy. They will be followed up for 2 years, assessing for evidence of side-effects, changes in anti-HLA antibodies, stabilisation of transplant function and changes in strength of alloreactive T and B cell function. This study should lead to a greater understanding of the role of antibodies and B cells in CR and accommodation. This work is expected to eventually improve the prognosis of patients with failing grafts, thus having a significant impact on the lives of all renal transplant recipients.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-02-11</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>319038</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Roche Organ Transplantation Research Foundation (ROTRF)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Switzerland, Swiss Confederation</gtr:country><gtr:description>Roche Global/ Organ Transplant Research Fund</gtr:description><gtr:id>1DC668A4-253C-47A1-81E2-746A1B8C933C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Prior to an introduction of a clinically funded anti-HLA testing programme in post-transplant patients at the Hammersmith Hospital, this support has allowed us to begin testing patients from an early stage in the research project.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>37FBC85E6FE-2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Roche are providing the Rituximab for the trial patients.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>This funding is supporting the costs of additional laboratory science which were not covered by the consumables allowance provided by the MRC: it will support the costs of serial testing of anti-HLA testing in stable patients and those with de-novo antibodies who are not entered into the RituxiCAN-C4 trial, serial testing for non-HLA antibodies, and additional costs incurred in analysis of the role played by B cells and T reg cells in the in vitro T cell responses.
