Acoustic analysis is a sonically based architectural analysis that can reveal detail about these practices. Because 'time is collapsed for the archaeological observer', even a partial or fractured understanding of the use of music, acoustics and sound in a space can act to animate the information we have from these architectural fragments. Sound brings the world to life, it can appear to fill spaces, create atmospheres, and have an intense emotive power. It exists in the time domain and can add a third dimension to an otherwise flattened interpretation. Whilst architecture demarcates space, sound demarcates time.\n\nAn archaeological study of a physical space is lifeless without an accompanying understanding of the narratives that developed within it. Understanding what Giddens might call time-geographies of space, developing narratives and rites of passage, is important so that we can understand how the users of a space felt about it. In prehistory sound was a primary focus for accumulating knowledge, culture and information, as transmission largely happened using language (the acoustic), rather than writing (the visual). As Marshall Mcluhan has said, 'Among peoples at an 'oral-aural' level of culture to whom writing was unknown, the ear exercised an overwhelming tyranny over the eye.' We can therefore expect to find as much out about the reasons for the layout of a site by investigating its acoustics as by investigating its visual and physical layout, especially in a site that does not seem to be designed for strictly functional purposes such as accommodation or defence. James Gibson has told us that sound gives 'information about the temporal structure of the event that caused it and the vibratory frequency of this event . . . with great precision'. The acoustic environment, as a key focus in prehistory of communication and development within an oral and aural culture, merits as much investigation as the context of the use of bone, stone, metal, wood or ceramics. \n\nAs it exists in the time domain acoustics can give us invaluable information about so-called non-material or intangible elements of culture such as music, ritual and religion. 'When it comes to affairs of the soul, of emotion and feeling, or of the 'inwardness' of life, hearing surpasses seeing as understanding goes beyond knowledge, and as faith transcends reason. . . Vision in this conception, defines the self individually in opposition to others; hearing defines the self socially in relation to others.' (Ingold). Both Gibson and Ingold discuss how vision and hearing are not so much disparate as interchangeable, are an active single task of perception, as looking and listening. If we accept 'looking and listening' is together a fused irreducible act of perception then any archaeological analysis of architecture must include analysis of sound. 'Vision, since it is untrained by the subjective experience of light, yields knowledge of the outside world that is rational, detached, analytical and atomistic. Hearing, on the other hand, since it rests on the immediate experience of sound, is said to draw the world into the perceiver, yielding a kind of knowledge that is intuitive, engaged, synthetic and holistic.'\n\nA series of study days will create an interdisciplinary reasearch cluster that will explore the sonic architecture of prehistory. It will involve specialists including those from the fields of archaeology, acoustics, music technology, acoustic modelling, digital modelling, CAVE and RAVE multimedia visual environments, ethnomusicology, archaeoacoustics, music archaeology and anthropology. It will aim to develop research teams and proposals that will develop focused research projects based on particular sites.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>24486</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Lazio Region</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Italy, Italian Republic</gtr:country><gtr:department>Council for Culture, Sport, Youth Policy and Tourism</gtr:department><gtr:description>European Music Archaeology Project</gtr:description><gtr:id>FECF3B87-B6D0-4DDD-A576-C60CBBB18835</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Edge of Time: Palaeolithic Bone Flutes from France and Germany.

Annie Goh. Featuring Rupert Till, Anna Friederike Potengowski and Iegor Reznikoff. June 2015. Archaeoacoustics researchers Rupert Till and Igor Reznikoff travelled to Isturitz and Arcy-sur-Cure caves to carry out sound archaeology research accompanied by a recording crew from DRK. They explored sound and acoustics in the caves. Isturitz Cave was the site of a find of numerous prehistoric musical instruments, such as vulture bone flutes. A reconstruction of this flute was played and recorded in the cave, and acoustical tests were carried out using scientific instruments to explore Reznikoff's voice led approach to studying sound in such sites.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dda63f4d0aa8.19019469</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.deutschlandradiokultur.de/ursendung-klingende-fruehgeschichte-archaeoakustik.1022.de.html?dram:article_id=317222</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>'Volume Without Sparks', Interview on Stonehenge research, Australian Broadcasting Corporation Radio National</gtr:description><gtr:form>A broadcast e.g. TV/radio/film/podcast (other than news/press)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>38C7F758-BB79-45AC-81D5-C7053F357399</gtr:id><gtr:impact>'Volume Without Sparks', Interview on Stonehenge research, Australian Broadcasting Corporation Radio National, 17.4.15.
