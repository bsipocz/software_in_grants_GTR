The changing climate and the competing demand for plants as biofuels further exacerbates this situation. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants use the energy from the sun to convert carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into carbohydrates and other chemical compounds, which are used for growth. Over the last decade numerous experiments of plants grown in elevated CO2 have shown unambiguously that increased rates of photosynthetic carbon assimilation can lead to increased biomass. Furthermore transgenic experiments conducted during the 1990's in which activities of individual enzymes were up- or down- regulated provided information showing that manipulation of the Calvin cycle could influence plant composition and increase plant productivity. These studies clearly identified photosynthetic carbon assimilation as an untapped opportunity to increase yield. In this project we will produce transgenic Arabidopsis plants with altered photosynthetic characteristics based on a combination of empirical data, metabolic and network modeling. A detailed physiological and molecular analysis of the resulting lines will carried out to obtain detailed measurements of photosynthetic parameters and growth in greenhouse grown plants. The transgenic plants generated in this programme with altered photosynthetic carbon metabolism will be used to explore the relationships between CO2 assimilation, carbon storage and plant growth. These analyses will provide data for further interrogation and improvement of these models. This research will also provide a proof of concept and will form the basis to enable informed manipulation of crop plants.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Increasing demands of the growing world population for food and fuel are putting ever greater pressure on the need to develop higher yielding crop varieties. This goal must be achieved in a sustainable manner and in the face of elevated levels of CO2 and more extreme conditions of water availability and temperature. There is compelling evidence, from both transgenic studies and in silico kinetic modelling, that there is an opportunity to improve photosynthetic performance and that this can lead to significant increases in yield.
The overall aim of this project is to take an integrated approach using the knowledge gained from empirical analyses of transgenic plants and in silico studies from both metabolic and transcriptional network modelling, to produce plants with enhanced photosynthetic performance and increased yield. 

1. Produce and verify transgenic plants with altered combinations of enzymes and proteins identified as targets from modelling and empirical studies. 
2. Undertake physiological and molecular analysis of selected transgenic plants to obtain detailed measurements of leaf biochemistry, photosynthetic parameters and growth data in plants grown in well watered and water limiting conditions.
3. Refine the transcriptional and kinetic models based on analysis of transgenic plants. Use
the 'improved' models to identify further manipulations of photosynthetic carbon metabolism.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM THIS RESEARCH?
The work is directly relevant to agriculture and for this reason the main non-academic beneficiaries of this research will be the agri-biotech commercial sector. In particular, the big four agri-businesses that have programmes to increase yield or alter composition of crop plants (Monsanto, Syngenta, Bayer AG, BASF Plant Science).

HOW WILL THEY BENEFIT FROM THIS RESEARCH?
One of the main challenges for such crop improvement programmes is identifying genetic targets that have a predictable impact on the metabolic output of interest. Often, metabolic manipulations in crop plants are hampered by metabolic compensation or unexpected and unwanted perturbations in linked areas of the metabolic network. This research may provide a data that can be used to improve and develop models to address these issues. This research will lead to a greater understanding of the factors limiting photosynthetic carbon metabolism. Effectively, one would be able to make major reconfigurations of metabolism and possible metabolic routes and this is likely to generate more predictable outcomes. 
Ultimately, translation of this research into effective strategies for improving yield and composition of crops will benefit the UK economy (Sygenta, at least maintains a significant presence in the UK). Improved crop varieties will also be of benefit to UK agriculture and will help secure the security of food supply in the UK, thereby bringing substantial societal benefit.

WHAT WILL BE DONE TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BENEFIT FROM THIS RESEARCH?
We will endeavour to ensure that the companies mentioned above are aware of the research and its potential with respect to their yield programmes. We will open direct lines of communications with the relevant research directors in these companies at an early stage of the project and will provide them with regular updates of significant developments. This will be done by sending them 'executive summaries' of research progress and copies of any publications that result from the work. In addition, the PIs will visit the companies and give research seminars about the project.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>352167</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have shown that multigene manipulation of photosynthetic carbon metabolism can result in increased photosynthesis and biomass yield in model species.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings are now being translated into crop spaces e.g. SBPase has been shown in greenhouse grown wheat to increase grain yield and a field trial has been approved for the summer of 2017.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>29DDFC7A-4A6A-4F86-B797-4DBE2A5B934D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dd86e2cb7966.77968193</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>06E45446-4B8E-4C16-98AC-0C757EFB7415</gtr:id><gtr:title>Mesophyll photosynthesis and guard cell metabolism impacts on stomatal behaviour.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The New phytologist</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/34c31ee333e97735a913a35640827a32"><gtr:id>34c31ee333e97735a913a35640827a32</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lawson T</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0028-646X</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5675db5edc1b8</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>38DB7292-742C-44F0-B350-A7CE2B797D84</gtr:id><gtr:title>Multigene manipulation of photosynthetic carbon assimilation increases CO2 fixation and biomass yield in tobacco.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of experimental botany</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e59305af9b395b2dce367238855c6299"><gtr:id>e59305af9b395b2dce367238855c6299</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Simkin AJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0022-0957</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5675e41e91a13</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>31F898AD-31D9-4583-894F-6FF1CC473BE5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Simultaneous stimulation of sedoheptulose 1,7-bisphosphatase, fructose 1,6-bisphophate aldolase and the photorespiratory glycine decarboxylase-H protein increases COassimilation, vegetative biomass and seed yield in Arabidopsis.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Plant biotechnology journal</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e59305af9b395b2dce367238855c6299"><gtr:id>e59305af9b395b2dce367238855c6299</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Simkin AJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1467-7644</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58bfcf465b6351.12844469</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5A9AAC72-BFD3-4738-B9E4-BEFF81A91979</gtr:id><gtr:title>Overexpression of the RieskeFeS Protein Increases Electron Transport Rates and Biomass Yield.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Plant physiology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e59305af9b395b2dce367238855c6299"><gtr:id>e59305af9b395b2dce367238855c6299</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Simkin AJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0032-0889</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fcc3611aa86.30450166</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/J004138/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F442B6BE-8B89-4C01-8D3B-E8A4D320B672</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biomolecules &amp;
