The key challenge is to work on scales small compared to the wavelength of propagation in free space, seemingly in contradiction with fundamental bounds on optical apparatus. Remarkable progress has been made in recent years, particularly in the field of nanoplasmonics, where the unique optical properties of metals at visible frequencies are exploited to guide, confine and enhance electromagnetic energy. The field is ripe for applied mathematics to contribute to fundamental modelling and we propose a novel framework that for the first time exploits and elucidates the singularities underpinning plasmonic phenomena. Our goal is to reform fundamental understanding of plasmonic resonance and develop new tools for interpretation of experiments, preliminary design and optimisation. In turn, the new mathematical techniques we will develop for plasmonics will have wider applicability and increase synergy between applied mathematicians and physicists. 

Plasmonic phenomena occur when surface plasmons, namely collective electron-charge and electric-field oscillations, are excited at an interface between a metal and a dielectric. Metallic nanoparticles and nanostructures allow localising such oscillations to nanoscale volumes. Close to certain &amp;quot;natural frequencies&amp;quot;, external radiation is able to optimally transfer energy into the localised plasmons, resulting in a resonant response where absorption, scattering and the electric field around the structure are enhanced. These enhancements can be made particularly significant by using near-singular nanometallic geometries, e.g. closely spaced particles and elongated nanorods. Extensive experimental and theoretical research over the last two decades has demonstrated that the phenomenon of localised-surface-plasmon resonance (LSPR) is extremely rich. Accordingly, ad hoc numerical simulations of nanometallic structures, which assume specific geometries, materials, frequencies and external sources of radiation, often lack insight and are inefficient when exploring a large parameter space. Alternatively, LSPR can be elucidated and efficiently studied in terms of the natural surface-plasmon modes supported by the nanostructure, akin to analysing the sound of a stretched string in terms of its standing-wave harmonics. Unlike in the string analogy, however, surface-plasmon frequencies are nearly independent of size; in fact, surface-plasmon modes are governed by a scale- and material-invariant &amp;quot;plasmonic-eigenvalue problem&amp;quot;, involving just the structure's shape.

The plasmonic eigenvalue problem is therefore key to modelling and interpretation of plasmonic phenomena. Nevertheless, analytical solutions are rare and typically cumbersome, while it is difficult to computationally infer the infinity of modes, especially for the near-singular and multiple-scale geometries ubiquitous in applications. This project offers a completely new theoretical approach; we propose to innovate &amp;quot;singular-perturbation&amp;quot; techniques from applied mathematics to resolve exactly those extreme situations where conventional methods struggle, or mask the dominant physics behind details. Specifically, we will obtain &amp;quot;asymptotic&amp;quot; approximations becoming more accurate and simple in form as the geometry becomes multi-scale or as the spectrum becomes dense. In particular, in the former limit we will derive fundamental scalings and asymptotic formulae (e.g. power laws) characterising the extreme plasmonic response of closely spaced particles and elongated particles; in the latter limit we will develop a method akin to ray-optics - a new geometric interpretation of localised plasmons - yielding surface-plasmon quantisation rules analogous to those arising in quantum mechanics.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Societal impact. Nanoplasmonics is an immensely active area of research with huge promise to enable and revolutionise technologies spanning the health, energy and information sectors. Applications in bio-sensing are particularly advanced and some are already being commercialised (e.g. Causeway Sensors, QinetiQ and Oxonica in the UK, Renishaw group, LamdaGen); advancements are also being made towards heat-assisted magnetic recording, light-trapping for photovoltaics, point-of-care diagnostics and the use of metallic nanoparticles in medicine and cancer treatment. The present proposal is unique in its mathematical nature, offering a new approach to modelling plasmonic nanostructures based on the extreme limits underpinning their functionality. The societal and national impact of this project will be significant, but not immediate, in light of its fundamental nature. We envisage that our new theoretical framework, which has distinct advantages supplementing current modelling tools, will influence preliminary design of plasmonic structures and help interpret experimental testings.

Exploitation. More immediately, we expect our approach to have significant influence on nanoplasmonics research; we envisage it being used in preliminary design, back-of-the envelope calculations, e.g. of field enhancements and optical cross-sections, and in interpretation of experimental results. To this end, we will demonstrate in physics journals and conferences how pronounced plasmonic phenomena can be captured via scalings and singular asymptotic formulae, for nontrivial geometries and circumventing the need to obtain and digest &amp;quot;exact&amp;quot; solutions. This will emphasise the distinct advantages of an asymptotic approach and how it supplements other modelling approaches such as numerical simulations and transformation optics. We will actively participate in this process by collaborating with physicists in the field; the PI has active links, joint publications and a PhD student together with the plasmonics group at Imperial. Every effort will be made to form additional collaborations, particularly with experimentalists. To this end, and in addition to standard routes such as papers, conferences and workshops, we shall fully exploit links with programme grants EP/L024926/1 &amp;amp; EP/M013812/1 on metamaterials and plasmonics with which the PI's collaborators in mathematics and physics are involved with. Moreover, we will organise a joint math-physics mini-workshop on nanophotonics modelling in order to generate further opportunities for exploitation of our asymptotic approach and lure UK applied mathematicians into this field (helping to close a noticeable gap with EU and US applied-math communities). 

Personal development and training. This project will serve as a stepping stone for the PI to grow his research group, strengthen connections with physicists and applied mathematicians and build up towards larger funding applications. The PI will gain experience in managing funds, supervising a PDRA simultaneously and organising the joint maths-physics mini-workshop; the workshop will help elevate his standing in both communities leading to new collaborations and joint funding applications. The host institution is supporting this proposal by offering 3 months of PDRA funding and by sponsoring the workshop; they will assign the PI a mentor, Prof. R. V. Craster, with vast experience in managing research grants and workshops. Moreover, the PI and PDRA will enjoy access to an internal platform funding scheme (to top up workshop and traveling funds) and the PI has been awarded start-up funds, a Roth Phd studentship and is completing a teaching-training programme. In turn, the hired PDRA and students working on the project will receive training at the interface of applied mathematics, physics and engineering, and will interact with leading researchers from all three sectors; they would therefore gain tools to uniquely contribute in either academia or industry.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>195100</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R041458/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E847DD9B-2053-4BC7-97A9-4213B185C968</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>80</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>561091A1-9FC9-4508-B1B2-2F3623E1FC9D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials Characterisation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>04D8FF87-2CFC-44E7-A7DF-47E10C813E05</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>80</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical Analysis</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
