Roughly speaking, this means that the trajectory of a particle will be changed completely by just a small change of the initial conditions. Chaos plays a particularly important role for systems consisting of many particles, such as condensed-matter systems or gases of cold atoms. It can come about in several different ways: Some systems already show chaotic behaviour if only one particle is present. For other systems strong interactions between the particles (in particular the Coulomb interaction of electric charges) give rise to chaos. Yet another form of chaos is possible in cold atom gases. At low temperatures these gases display Bose-Einstein condensation, i.e., all atoms are in the same quantum-mechanical state. This state can be described by a so-called macroscopic wavefunction whose dynamics is given by a nonlinear differential equation (the nonlinear Schroedinger equation). Due to the nonlinearity the behaviour of this wavefunction can depend sensitively on the initial conditions just like the trajectory of a particle in a chaotic system. Paradigmatic examples for chaos are the Bose-Hubbard model (one of the most important models in many-body and cold atom theory) as well as recent experiments with cold atoms in chaotic potentials.Developing mathematical methods to deal with chaos in many-particle systems is an urgent priority. Experiments with cold atoms are now reaching a stage where chaotic dynamics and strong interactions play a crucial role. Moreover there is an interesting prediction that important quantum-mechanical properties such as the conductance of strongly interacting many-particle systems should in fact be universal and not depend on the details of the system.Universal behaviour is also expected for the statistics of the energy levels (the discrete values the energy is allowed to assume in a quantum system). Understanding the precise conditions under which many-particle systems behave in a universal way is important both from a fundamental and from a technological point of view: Universal features can be modelled in an efficient way, whereas non-universal features can be tuned to generate desirable behaviour in technological applications.Recent breakthroughs in quantum chaos (that I was involved in myself) now make it possible to tackle these questions. This will be the aim of the proposed project. An important step will be to systematically study how the full theory of quantum many-particle systems is connected to two approximate descriptions: classical many-particle theory, and an effective quantum mechanical description based on the macroscopic wavefunction. To elucidate this connection I will generalize a central result from quantum chaos (the Gutzwiller trace formula) to express properties of the quantum many-particle system as sums over solutions for the macroscopic wavefunction. With these tools in place it will be possible to clarify in which regimes many-particle systems display universal behaviour, and in which regimes important system specific effects are to be expected.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>To facilitate the transfer of knowledge it is vital that the research results reach both the mathematical physics community and researchers in many-particle systems, condensed matter theory and cold atoms. This will be ensured by keeping contact with leading researchers in these fields during conferences, visits as well as electronically. In particular I am planning to invite a researcher in these areas to Bristol for two weeks, as well as host a few shorter visits combined with talks in the Mathematical Physics seminar which I am co-organizing. In addition the project will involve several conference participations and visits by the postdoc and myself. Condensed-matter systems such as mesoscopic conductors or quantum dots have important applications. For instance quantum dots are used in diodes, biological analysis and solar cells. Hence the effects of nonintegrability and interactions on the conductance of such systems studied in this project may have important technological consequences. This technological impact is a long term perspective and will most likely be achieved through transfer of knowledge from mathematics to theoretical and experimental physics and then further to engineering. It will thus be maximised by fostering interdisciplinary exchange. The Bristol Mathematical Physics group also has a long-standing tradition of collaborations with industry, allowing to explore any more direct technological connections. Finally the work in this project will raise my independent research profile as well as add to my leadership experience; the postdoc will broaden their research experience; and my postgraduate student will profit from cross-fertilization between the proposed work and his PhD project.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>96644</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The vast majority of systems found in nature are fully or partly chaotic. Roughly speaking, this means that the trajectory of
the particle will be changed completely by just a small change of the initial conditions. Chaos plays a particularly important

It can come about in several different ways: Some systems already show chaotic behaviour if only one particle is present. For other systems strong interactions between the particles (in particular the attraction or repulsion of electric charges) give rise to chaos.

Developing mathematical methods to deal with chaos in many-particle systems is an urgent priority. Experiments with cold atoms are now reaching a stage where chaotic dynamics and strong interactions play a crucial role. Moreover there is an interesting prediction that important quantum-mechanical properties of strongly interacting many-particle systems should in fact be universal and not depend on the details of the system. Universal behaviour is also expected for the statistics of the energy levels (the discrete values the energy is allowed to assume in a quantum system). Understanding the precise conditions under which many-particle systems behave in a universal way is important both from a fundamental and from a technological point of view: Universal features can be modelled in an efficient way, whereas non-universal
features can be tuned to generate desirable behaviour in technological applications.

An important step is to systematically study how the full theory of quantum many-particle systems is connected to two
approximate descriptions: classical many-particle theory, and an effective quantum mechanical description based on the
macroscopic wavefunction. To elucidate this connection we have generalised a central result from quantum chaos (the
Gutzwiller trace formula) to express properties of quantum many-particle system as a sums over solutions for the
macroscopic wavefunction.

In this project we have derived a generalization of the Gutzwiller model to a large class of many-particle systems including the Bose-Hubbard model. This formula holds in the semiclassical limit as well as the limit where the number of particles becomes large. We have then used this formula to investigate the statistical properties of spectra of these systems, and we have found universal spectral statistics under rather general conditions. Our results are supported by numerical simulations concerning the classical and quantum mechanical properties of Bose-Hubbard models. A paper containing the key results has been published in New Journal of Physics.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Promising applications are:
- To study properties of chaotic many-body systems outside the conditions identified in our research. We expect that in some regimes not covered by the conditions we established the statistics will be faithful to predictions based on so-called embedded random matrix ensembles. I am also interested in this direction myself; it ties in very well with work I did with a current PhD student who was funded as departmental support 
for this grant. So far two papers have been published from this line of research. A new PhD student is investigating the impact of Ruelle-Pollicot resonances on spectral statistics, with a view of applying these results to chaotic many-body systems.
- Applications of the developed techniques to many other phenomena in quantum many-particle physics. Here our work connects nicely to recent research undertaking by other groups identifying further applications for semiclassics in condensed matter physics (e.g. the boson sampling problem).
In general the application of methods developed in quantum chaos to many-body systems is currently one of the hot topics in the area. Our work has been featured prominently at recent conferences, along with complementary work by several leading research groups.
- Applications to research on quantum dots (used in diodes, biological analysis and solar cells;promising candidates for building quantum computers)
- Translation of the advances regarding nonlinear equations to nonlinear optics relevant for high-intensity lasers. 
- Our research contributed to clarifying of the applicability of random matrix techniques in complex settings. Developments in this direction are likely to have applications in other areas these techniques are used in, including areas with important economic/technological relevance in their own right, e.g. mathematical finance and complex networks.
- There has been very helpful cross-fertilization between this work and an ongoing research project about solar cells.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>65D253AA-6A08-4951-A64E-2A64E6A82DDE</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54649a694b15f1.96276204</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Electronics,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/18/3/033009</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B24577B4-64E1-4F6F-AA09-F245609E3C30</gtr:id><gtr:title>Spectral statistics of chaotic many-body systems</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>New Journal of Physics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/3c0dbe5e1d532c8ab8390ee3479b0db1"><gtr:id>3c0dbe5e1d532c8ab8390ee3479b0db1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dubertrand R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5464a5c8d030e1.95644905</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/I014233/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>9C124926-5968-486F-9B51-CCEB6C4E9650</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Particle physics - theory</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ABA2EC9F-6524-443A-BB92-7DF199FE4B25</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical Physics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
