Multiple ignition sources can lead to extreme stresses on many UK Fire and Rescue Services (FRS). With fire management events, payback from optimal deployment of resources is greatly magnified when one considers that we may be preventing a small fire from getting out of control and becoming a major event. This project will combine a research level understanding of the spatial controls on ?fire danger? and fire behaviour, a probabilistic approach to classifying risk and an understanding of the propagation of uncertainty to build significant enhancements in the current Fire Severity Index information and 5-day forecasts produced by the Met Office. This will allow the Met Office to provide new services to new clients, namely UK Fire and Rescue Services, UK landowners in relation to prescribed burns and the relevant authorities controlling public land access.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-05-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-11-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>25057</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Meteorological Office UK</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Enhancing Calculation and Communication of UK Wildfire Danger Forecasts in Support of UK Fire &amp;amp; Rescue Service Wildfire Response, Landowner Prescribed Burn Planning, and UK Land Access Management</gtr:description><gtr:id>F28007D9-1DEF-45CB-B9AD-9754CFB7C878</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Research paper describing the research findings: doi:10.5194/nhess-16-1217-2016</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56deb454ea1e05.48183739-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Provision of meteorological and fire weather data, expertise in working with these data, computer code (and training in the use of it) for processing these data.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Leading the analysis of meteorological/fire weather data, writing the final project report/paper, presenting the final project outputs, results dissemination at stakeholder meetings.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Wildfire Conference 2014 (Sill National Landscape Discovery Centre, Northumberland)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>27B78BEE-DAC1-4DAD-B924-CF02221EC401</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation of my work on wildfires and fire danger rating in the UK (resulting from my PhD work and NERC PURE Associateship (PA13-017) ) to fire and rescue professionals, students and third sector organisations from across the Northumberland region, national and international attendees.

The key findings of this project were:

? A percentile-based fire danger rating system (FDRS) may prove more effective for highlighting periods of fire danger than the existing MOFSI approach does. Under the existing MOFSI approach, fire danger bandings are assigned based on spatially fixed numerical thresholds of the FWI component of the FWI System. Defining fire danger bandings using locally (2km x 2km) calculated percentiles of historic FWI conditions was found to improve forecasting skill. This method also avoids a geographical bias identified in the current MOFSI system, in which higher levels of fire danger are less likely to be forecast in the north-west vs. the south-east of the UK, despite considerable fire activity occurring across the entire country. 
? The majority of wild fire activity in Great Britain between 2010-12 occurred during periods when FWI components were high relative to historic conditions. At least one FWI system component exceeded its 75th percentile during 85 % of historic wildfire events, with the 90th and 99th percentiles exceeded during 61 % and 18 % of events respectively.
? There are also likely benefits of utilising multiple FWI system components in a UK FDRS, rather than just the FWI component. While the FWI component of the FWI system was identified as being the most skilful predictor of wildfire activity in summer, the FWI, ISI and FFMC components were identified as being similarly skilful predictors in spring, when most UK fire activity occurs.
? A strong relationship between the raw (non-percentile) FFMC component of the FWI system and fire activity was found at a national level, suggesting that this maybe a useful indicator of risk of sustained ignition in a revised forecasting system.

While it is clear that a statistically driven FDRS is no replacement for an empirically-derived FDRS based upon a comprehensive campaign of controlled burning studies, the findings of this work suggest that in the short term, fire danger rating in the UK could be considerably improved relatively quickly and without extensive field studies if (a) a percentile based thresholding approach is taken, and (b) additional components of the FWI system are utilised.

This project also highlighted the benefits of having a nationally centralised database of wildfires, in the form of the incident recording system (IRS) for fire and rescue authorities (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/incident-recording-system-for-fire-and-rescue-authorities). Despite being a relatively new resource, it proved to be invaluable for this research and without it the findings of this study could not have been made. The continuation and improvement of this dataset will undoubtedly considerably benefit future research on UK wildland fire.

More generally, this study constitutes one of most comprehensive studies of fire activity and how it relates to fire weather in the UK. As such, the relationships identified here at a country/land cover level can be further investigated - potentially in local/regional scale studies - both for academic research or by non-academic groups to aid in decision making processes related to fire planning, preparedness and response.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>9E3928AE-03B2-418D-8C31-5960F256F71F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c8089c854516.75073913</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.nat-hazards-earth-syst-sci.net/16/1217/2016/nhess-16-1217-2016.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>299F629A-2142-4A69-BFEE-61444212FEB9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Calibration and evaluation of the Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) System for improved wildland fire danger rating in&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;United Kingdom</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/06c58c1464039e025e92e9e43cf5142e"><gtr:id>06c58c1464039e025e92e9e43cf5142e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>de Jong M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>589b4f7deabeb4.99171327</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">PURE13017</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
