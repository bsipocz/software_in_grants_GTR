cells for use in regenerative medicine</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>BB/M003221/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide and is characterised by the dysfunction of the endothelium, which is the thin layer of cells that lines the interior surface of blood vessels. The cells that form the endothelium are named endothelial cells (ECs). Therefore, replacing damaged ECs has been recognised as a potential therapeutic option for cardiovascular disease but identification and availability of appropriate cell types has been a major limitation. Based on the remarkable recent discovery, human fibroblasts or other somatic cells have the potential to initiate a reprogramming process and become pluripotent. This is a method based on the forced-expression of four reprogramming transcription factors, which are able to transform any differentiate cell back to the pluripotent stage. These cells are named induced pluripotent stem cells and hold a great potential for regenerative medicine. As these cells are pluripotent, they are also able to differentiate towards any cell type within the body and be used for cell therapy. Indeed induced pluripotent stem cells are able to differentiate to ECs and in theory could be a great cell source to treat cardiovascular disease. Although, the use of induced pluripotent stem cells to derive ECs may preserve a great potential for personalised medicine and vascular cell therapy, the main restriction is the risk of these cells to develop tumors as they are in a pluripotent stage. 
To overcome this limitation, recently, a new paradigm of direct conversion of one differentiated cells to another has been proposed. In this regard, we have asked the question whether it would be possible to bring a differentiated cell type to a transient state where it could be easily directed to another desired cell type like ECs, without reaching pluripotency. To this end, we adapted a method to generate partially-induced pluripotent stem cells by overexpressing the 4 reprogramming factors to human fibroblasts for short periods of time. Importantly, these cells did not form tumours and clearly displayed the potential to differentiate into ECs when they were stimulated with specific growth factors and cultured in appropriate conditions. This new approach is named direct reprogramming and holds an enormous potential for regenerative medicine. However, the efficiency of direct reprogramming is very low because the underlying mechanisms remain totally unclear. Studying the mechanisms underpinning this process should permit for improvements in reprogramming methods and generate fast and efficient direct reprogramming strategies, which could be used in future clinical applications to benefit specific-patients' groups. 
In this study I will elucidate the mechanisms behind direct reprogramming of ECs in order to establish homogeneous populations of differentiated cells to be used in regenerative medicine to treat vascular disease. In particular, we hypothesise that the direct reprogramming towards ECs is a two-step approach. Initially, the four reprogramming factors activate specific gene regulatory networks related to ECs, which will respond to specific stimuli such as Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor and will allow the induction of EC specific markers (second step). This study will elucidate for the first time the mechanisms of direct reprogramming towards ECs providing novel data which will support that direct reprogramming is a two-step process. This study holds the promise to uncover the underlying mechanisms of direct reprogramming which could be expanded to other cell lineages beyond EC reprogramming. Importantly, this work will also establish the potential of reprogrammed ECs to restore EC function and promote perfusion of ischemic tissue in appropriate research animal models. Together, these findings may establish the therapeutic reality of reprogrammed ECs which would have transforming consequences for regenerative and personalised medicine.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide and is characterised by endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction. Replacing damaged ECs has been recognised as a potential therapeutic option but identification and availability of appropriate cell types has been a major limitation. Recently, a new paradigm of direct reprogramming strategy; &amp;quot;conversion of one somatic cell type to another through reprogramming&amp;quot; has been devised. We reasoned that, at earlier time points during reprogramming, we could direct the epigenetically activated cells which are induced by the iPS cell factors into lineage specific cell types such as ECs under defined conditions without traversing pluripotency. To this end, we adapted a method to generate partially reprogrammed cells, which did not form tumours in vivo and clearly displayed the potential to differentiate into ECs. However, the efficiency of direct reprogramming is very low and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Studying the mechanisms underpinning this process should permit for improvements in reprogramming methods and generate fast and efficient strategies. In this study I will elucidate the mechanisms underpinning direct reprogramming of ECs. In particular, it is hypothesised that the direct reprogramming towards ECs is a two-step approach. Initially, the four reprogramming factors activate EC-Regulatory-Networks, which will respond to specific stimuli such as Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor and Fibroblasts Growth Factor and will allow the induction of EC specific markers. This knowledge will allow us to realise fundamental principles of cell reprogramming and establish homogeneous populations of differentiated cells. Importantly, this work will also establish the potential of reprogrammed ECs to enhance angiogenesis and neovascularisation. Together, these findings may establish the therapeutic potential of reprogrammed ECs which would have transforming consequences for regenerative and personalised medicine.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Academic: The results of this proposed study will be presented at scientific meetings and they will be engaged with academics through publication in the leading high-impact journals in the field. The data will also be presented at annual international and national scientific meetings such as the International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR), American Heart Association and the British Society for Cardiovascular Research, as the applicant is a regular attendee at these scientific conferences. 
Public: Direct reprogramming is a very interesting and novel approach, which it has an enormous potential for regenerative medicine. We have recently reported for the first time in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA our success to directly reprogram fibroblasts into endothelial cells. This work has been highlighted in a press release and in the university webpage as cutting-edge research in the field of regenerative medicine. Importantly, this article has been selected by the British Heart Foundation (BHF) for use in an open competition for PhD students to produce an essay based on the significance of this work in cardiovascular disease. A Commentary on Cutting Edge Science entitled as &amp;quot;Therapeutic transdifferentiation: a novel approach for vascular disease&amp;quot; has also been published in Circulation Research based on our work. Therefore, it is anticipated that the proposed study will have a high public profile since it can demonstrate the potential to provide benefits to patients in the long-term so it is expected to generate substantial interest. An outline of this work will be posted on the Queen's University Belfast (QUB) web pages. Information will also be provided to local charities or patient groups detailing its contribution to improve understanding and treatment of vascular disease. For example, the Centre for Centre for Experimental Medicine stem cell group recently participated in the Eurostem cell initiative, whereby debates are brought to school groups across Europe, including Northern Ireland and the UK (http://www.eurostemcell.org/story/who-what-where-when-why-stem-cells-w5-belfast). All of these engagements will be preserved in line with the public relations guidelines of QUB communications office and acknowledgement of BBSRC funding. 

EXPLOITATION AND DISSEMINATION. 
The impact of this research has the potential to contribute to the broader community by serving to prevent a major cause of morbidity and reduced quality of life. The applicant is actively engaged in presenting her work to the non-scientific community on a number of occasions including to patient groups and charity bodies. Since cardiovascular disease maintains a high profile and our project has the potential to provide benefits for these patients in the long-term, the process of direct reprogramming is a very attractive and novel approach. Thus, it would be expected to generate considerable interest consistent with the clear therapeutic promise of regenerative medicine. We will attempt to target and engage a wide range of stakeholders, including research scientists, clinicians, and cardiovascular support groups. Our previous success in this area is evidenced by selection of our recent publication in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA by the BHF for a PhD student competition, as detailed above. We will also work closely with the institutional communications office at QUB to stimulate similar events and increase the amount and quality of research-related information available to the public. 
Schools, young People and other related events: Importantly, a number of opportunities will be created for young people in order to promote their engagement in science, technology, biology and mathematics. A number of summer laboratory projects, sponsored by appropriate organisations, will also be provided, including stem cell forums and debates about stem cells and cell reprogramming and their potential in clinical application.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-06</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-12-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>383386</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Strathclyde</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Prof John McCarron</gtr:description><gtr:id>5EBA227D-6443-465C-B719-5777AD31CF80</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A grant application based on our pivotal and novel strategy of Mitochondrial reprogramming has been recently submitted to BBSRC.

I was awarded a First Contact Initiative Grant from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) in 2013 to visit and establish collaboration with the laboratory of Professor Deepak Srivastava in Gladstone Institute of Cardiovascular Research in University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Professor Srivastava's group is internationally recognised for their studies in cell reprogramming. This ESC grant has provided me with an unparalleled opportunity to expand my own area of research and establish collaborations with leading laboratories in the world.

During my visit to the Gladstone Institute I had the opportunity to interact with and learn from Professor Deepak Srivastava's group which focuses on the fundamental events involved in cell fate determination and differentiation and organogenesis. I benefited from their impressive reprogramming strategies to directly reprogram fibroblasts into cardiomyocyte-like cells for regenerative purposes and learnt a number of in vitro and in vivo reprogramming models. I also gained skills in new methods for efficiently reprogramming induced pluripotent stem cells from blood cells using novel approaches. 
I had also the privilege to meet and discuss with 
Dr Kathy Ivey, the Director of the Gladstone Stem Cell Core, who has offered me expert suggestions and advice based on these novel techniques including provision of detailed protocols for continuous support of my research.

I was delighted to have the chance to visit the Gladstone Institute and establish collaborations with outstanding group leaders such as:

 Professor Bruce R. Conklin, which will enhance my knowledge in genome engineering

 of reprogramming cells and benefit to address the question of my research using these 

 high standard technologies.

 Professor Yamanaka's group to learn and discuss about new approaches of induced

 pluripotent stem cell generation, about switch of cell fate and how to improve the efficiency 

 of cell reprogramming.

Its importance and high profitability potential is highlighted in BCC Research market research reports (2014) according to which: &amp;quot;The global market for induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) was estimated to total $853 million in 2012, and close to $1.2 billion in 2013, averaging 40% growth. 
Our novel technology currently fills in a gap in the market and offers a greatly profitable marketing opportunity in this rapidly-expanding and extremely popular science field. So far, the iPS cells generation process is often long and laborious including many steps. It is also inconvenient to the donor of somatic cells. The cells produced may also contain viral-driven mutations. In contrast, our kit and protocol offers a reduction in the steps needed in the generation. It is also safer, faster and more reproducible. It will make &amp;quot;disease-in-a-dish&amp;quot; a faster and highly efficient approach in any lab around the world using an extremely small volume of blood. 
The market of iPS cells is expected to reach $2.9 billion in 2018, an estimated compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.7% for the five-year period 2013 to 2018.&amp;quot; This trend is bound to continue increasing and expanding and our novel technology is predicted to have an enormous impact on this. 
In summary, our novel protocol and novel kit concept has the following advantages over other similar products in the market.
1. Protocol novelty: Very small volume of sample, very short time iPS cell generation time with high efficiency, safer cell reprogramming, more cost-effective, and suitable for both healthy donors and diabetic patients.
2. Kit novelty: Simplified gene delivery transfection method using a specific kit component never before used in the market for the generation of iPS cells (or cell reprogramming in general). 
We are in Initial stages of developing and optimising our method, our next step is to seek support for further developing this product and bringing to the market in the foreseeable future.</gtr:description><gtr:id>AFC41546-306B-4B93-B3BD-C1D31844F9A6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The patient-specific cells which could be generated based on our novel method have the potential to differentiate towards any cell type in the body (such as vascular cells, cardiac cells, kidney cells, neurons, b-cells etc..).

In the ten years since Yamanaka and Takahashi first developed iPS cells more is understood about the mechanisms and potential uses. Trials in animal models, including non-human primates, are promising for many diseases and clinical trials are being suggested with an ongoing trial for a patient's macular degeneration. Clinical-grade iPS cells for the application in regenerative medicine are being developed. This is a huge step in the move toward humanised trials and it will be very exciting to see how the use of iPS cells in human personalised and regenerative medicine progresses over the next few years. However, the iPS cells generation is still a long term process with extremely low efficiency which holds significantly the potential of these cells to be used widely in the clinic. In our lab, we are proposing for the first time, a novel, fast and highly efficient approach of generating iPS cells from only few drops of blood from health volunteers and diabetic patients.</gtr:description><gtr:id>DB968F0A-F386-4FE6-B6B9-6A8B53F1577C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>All our cell lines, DNA constructs and data from the RNA-seq and samples from our in vivo studies, after publication, will be fully available to research community to be use for Regenerative Medicine and also in order to facilitate the highest 3Rs impact in our research. Importantly, our research is contributing to develop tools to replace the use of animals to screen drugs and test cell based therapies. We have now established robust methods of generating patient specific stem cells in a peri-dish within only 1 week. These cells have the potential to differentiate towards any cell type and can be used as a powerful models to screen drugs and develop cell based therapies for diabetes and cardiovascular diseases in a petri-dish. We can screen drugs based on a personalised approach since the patient specific cells in the lab &amp;quot;mimic&amp;quot; the disease phenotype. Therefore, personalised therapies could be developed replacing and reducing the need of animal use as models to screen drugs and assess cell function. We have established strong collaborations in Europe and USA to share these models, which could also involve gene editing of the patient specific cell lines to correct mutations, epigenetic memories, and dysfunctional pathways. We communicate our findings will our collaborators and in the conferences with other researchers, but also we maintain a strong engagement with the general public. Dr Margariti is giving talks to the charities supporting diabetes and cardiovascular disease and patient specific focus-groups, discussing our research and the potential to develop novel therapies to treat diabetes complications. In addition, we are informing the public about our novel models which are proposing to develop personalised drug screening and therapies, and highlighting that we make every effort to reduce the use of animals in our research and introduce a high 3Rs impact in our research. Dr Margariti has already established these connections with diabetic and cardiovascular disease patients, who regularly visit the Centre and her lab and receive information and updates. The lead applicant is also organising the &amp;quot;stem cells&amp;quot; stand in the NI Science Festival, which is taking place every February in CEM, QUB. More than 400 public members are visiting the Centre that day and Dr Margariti's group is performing &amp;quot;real time experiments&amp;quot; based on stem cells, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and regenerative medicine and informing the members of the public about their research and discussing the potential of developing novel therapies to treat diabetes and cardiovascular disease. In addition, a number of families who have relatives with diabetes and cardiovascular disease visit Dr Margariti's lab every year, discussing about her research and observing patient specific cells under the microscope. Therefore, we will continue to engage a wide range of stakeholders, including research scientists, clinicians, and diabetic support groups. Finally, Dr Margariti is offering a number of Nuffield student placement programmes, and QUB has a Clinical Academic Training Programme (CATP) in order to provide opportunities for engaging with young scientists. Dr Margariti's lab is fully engaging with these programmes by offering up to 10 projects per Academic year providing training on cutting-edge technologies.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ca832f44e2f4.68089433</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Novel reprogramming methods of generating functional patients vascular cells to be used for Regenerative and Personilised Medicine.</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>We have developed novel strategies to generate patient specific stem cells and fully differentiated cells derived from an extremely low amount of starting materials such as blood cells or skin cells.</gtr:description><gtr:id>305058A9-D33E-4E26-8C98-ED50B68BAC77</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This has an enormous potential as for the first time provides us with the patient-specific cells in a petri dish which represents the pathological picture of a patient in vitro.
