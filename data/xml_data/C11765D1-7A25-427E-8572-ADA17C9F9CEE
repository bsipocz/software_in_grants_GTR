How can we best increase incomes from collection of non-timber forest products? Can education and information provision lead to real changes in behavior that better protects ecosystem services? After decades of attempts to better protect Amazonian forests and the ecosystem services that they provide, we still have no idea what the answers are to these questions. Further, notwithstanding the importance of ecosystem services, we have little evidence about which policy interventions can best ensure service provision and alleviate poverty. A fundamental need is thus for the development of 'program evaluation' methods in order to test policy or intervention effectiveness. In mid-altitude Bolivia, as in many parts of the developing world, agricultural decisions generate negative environmental externalities, reducing the quality and quantity of environmental service provision. Forest degradation, often associated with extensive cattle grazing, diminishes water quality and quantity and increases risks associated with landslides and flooding. There is a global and local interest in maintaining these upper Amazonian watershed forests both for their role in mitigating climate change, but also because their conservation will help local communities adapt to climate change through the maintenance of dry season water supplies. Despite the importance of these ecosystems for local poverty alleviation, local communities continue to graze more cattle than the carrying capacity of the forests, thus creating a tragedy of the commons in which deforestation, water pollution and flooding increase, and human welfare suffers. Our proposed research will explore alternative mechanisms for behavior change to mitigate the negative externalities that result from forest degradation. Our first hypothesis is that by providing targeted local information, or otherwise building local institutional capacity, we can lower collective action barriers at the community level, which will allow for locally imposed incentives through sanctions or positive compensation. As an alternative hypothesis, external donors, through direct payments, may better provide such incentives for improved grazing practices (i.e. a form of payments for environmental services). A rigorous experimental design will allows us to identify generalisable relationships between the provision of targeted information and financial incentives and resulting behavioral and biophysical outcome measures. By phasing in payments in the second year of the project, we will also observe the interaction between collective action and externally provided incentives. Although the list of activities sounds relatively esoteric, the implications of this research will be profound. We will develop and refine the program evaluation tools that are most appropriate for evaluations of ecosystem service provision, and then provide the first robust experimental analysis of what works for environmental service delivery and poverty alleviation and why. Our research will show that if a donor has, e.g. &amp;pound;500,000 to spend on climate change adaptation, whether it will it be most efficient for them, in terms of CO2 sequestered, water supplies protected, or livelihoods enhanced, to invest in local capacity building, information provision or direct payments schemes.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>240861</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Rare Conservation</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Knowledge Exchange Partnerships</gtr:description><gtr:id>787A1B2B-AEC1-4F4A-A312-071BE3D54341</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Green, K., A.

After trying various different training methodologies, in 2014 and 2015 we held three iterations of what we now call the &amp;quot;School for Reciprocal Watershed Agreements (RWA)&amp;quot;, training more than 60 representatives of NGOs and local governments from Bolivia, Belize, Costa Rica, Peru, Mexico, Colombia, Argentina and Ecuador. The teaching is organized into an introductory background and then five didactic modules:

? Step 1: Verify the presence of the basic conditions for Watershed Agreements (i.e. bottom-up PES)
? Step 2: Create the local institutional structure: a three way fund between the program promoter (usually an NGO) the municipal government and the local water provider
? Step 3: Ensure financial and institutional sustainability
? Step 4: Present and sign contracts with upstream water service providers
? Step 5: Monitor and evaluate results

The course is organized into a six-day program that combines classroom and practical field work, culminating with each student presenting how they will take the lessons they have learned during the week back to their own communities to initiate setting up their own RWA.

We have taken the results of the student's projects and have started testing three modalities of post-school support: (1) &amp;quot;Light&amp;quot; (i.e. very inexpensive) follow up: In Pasorapa, Omereque and Aiquille municipalities we have undertaken two personal individual follow up visits by Natura staff (2) &amp;quot;Medium&amp;quot; follow-up: In Tarija, we organized one joint meeting between representatives from six different municipalities, alumnae and Natura, and 3) &amp;quot;Intensive&amp;quot; (i.e. more expensive) follow up: in Robore and San Jose municipalities we have held a series of municipal/Natura meetings.

The municipalities assigned to each modality (Light, medium and intensive) are advancing at different rates in their attempts to implement RWA. Perhaps to be expected, we have advanced most rapidly in one of the &amp;quot;intensively&amp;quot; treated municipalities, San Jose. An alumna of the school prepared the ground for Natura to present to the Mayor and municipal council, leading to a Municipal Water Fund being created after less than five meetings and within 30 days. A process that has traditionally been a six-month investment by Natura staff, was thus accomplished in less than a month thanks to the RWA School. 

Unexpectedly though, the alumna's role was not to complete the entire process herself, but rather to simply do the groundwork and to validate to local authorities that Natura, and the RWA concept are &amp;quot;for real&amp;quot;. This initial success of a &amp;quot;paving-the-way&amp;quot; modality will help Natura improve the RWA School processes in the coming months. As we continue to further refine the modalities, it is already clear that the training program has the potential to exponentially increase the number of municipalities, beneficiaries and hectares conserved through the RWA model.

This model is being used in other municipalities both in Bolivia (by Fundacion Natura), and also in Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. 

Our research has thus led to more effective public policy and decision making in the Andes. Based on our results, 30 municipal governments, one state government (Santa Cruz) and the Bolivian national government have developed new forest conservation and climate change adaptation and mitigation legislation. The behaviour and practices of more than 70,000 people have been changed: 2000 upstream farmers are conserving 230,000 acres of forested &amp;quot;Water Factories&amp;quot;, and 68,000 people are paying them more then &amp;pound;200,000 a year to do so. Quality of life has improved: Bolivia's mid-altitude forests are better conserved, water quality has improved and thousands of families now have alternative livelihoods to destructive slash and burn agriculture. Similar changes are appearing in Colombia Ecuador and Peru.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2010</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>57A04C44-D384-4940-A6A6-89B198DB8767</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>m-6384813018.501562de278438</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>In-kind payments for environmental services were initiated in 65 randomly selected communities in late 2011. Initial take-up was low, as only &amp;quot;early adopters&amp;quot; joined in the first stage. However, by the end of 2012, 474 families in 57 communities had enrolled in the program, putting a total of 17,105 hectares under contract. The first wave of contracts was signed in 2011, and a year later, forest conservation compliance was 100%, while cattle removal compliance was c. 75%.

Although the compliance data is preliminary, and it is still too early to evaluate program impacts, the experiment is already providing interesting information about who joins PES schemes. Landowners who have joined the scheme are better off, are more involved in their community and are more likely to think that the environment provides them with benefits, than the general population. While these results are perhaps to be expected, this evidence may be useful as practitioners try to implement similar schemes around the world.

We have also learned important lessons in terms of field logistics. Eight people implemented the 2011 campaign, while the 2012 team had only five members. The value of the compensation paid increased by 70% between 2011 and 2012, while the cost of providing this compensation fell by 41%. Within each community, the compensation is offered on day 1, land parcels are measured before pre-contracts are then signed on days 2 and 3. Final contacts are then signed and compensations are delivered on days 6 and 7. It thus now takes less than a week from first offering the compensation package to a particular farmer, to actually delivering it.

Our research colleagues at Harvard, Tufts and the National University of Colombia are currently analyzing the data we collected during the project, while Natura's field technicians are preparing to enter the field in March 2013 to initiate the next wave of compensation deals. They will be expecting to build on cases such as in the community of Huantas, where 8 families joined the program in 2012, signing contracts to conserve 160 ha. In return for their conservation commitments, the families (5 led by women, 3 led by men) received compensation packages of apple and plum tree seedlings and barbed wire worth a total of &amp;pound;645, with an average value of &amp;pound;80 per family.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>To improve the design and implementation of conservation initiatives, especially those using incentives or markets</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>BD6210C2-28C1-4ED1-A5EF-AFD0D794EBA1</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-9133069551.6737827758f0a4</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.naturabolivia.org</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Development of national/regional/international development policies or investments</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A4973D78-40D7-4355-B210-CCA3C31B3B44</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The results of the research immediately refined government policy in the five intervention municipalities, and fed into the development of a statewide PES law in Santa Cruz Department, an area 50% larger than the United Kingdom.
