Open I-sections are the most common and efficient horizontal members to support the flooring system. The vertical members can either be open H-sections or tubular (structural hollow) sections. The latter has shown an increasing popularity due to its structural efficiency including high strength to weight ratio, high torisonal stiffness and pleasant appearance. In particular, circular and elliptical hollow sections possess inherent curvatures which allow architects to express the steel-framed buildings in a creative and exciting architecture in the built-environment. However, these advantages are often under-exploited due to the perceived difficulties on cost effective connections between I-beams and tubular columns. There is also a relative lack of design guidance in particular the reliability of semi-rigid connections under cyclic loading which will provide essential scientific information including energy dissipative behaviour for seismic design. New test and numerical results from this research for both monotonic and cyclic loadings will be used to prepare design rules for steel structures with sustainable credentials to be executed anywhere in the world. It will also help the UK to meet its strategy for sustainable construction.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Advances in construction research and innovation are driving forces that impact the UK economy by enhancing competitiveness and effectiveness. The following sections give key points to the impact plan for the proposed research. Beneficiaries It comprises Academic Sector (to be addressed in 'Academic Beneficiaries'), Intermediary Sector (IS), Construction Sector (CS), Standardisation Sector (SS) and Workforce Sector (WS). IS includes Steel Construction Institute (SCI) and International Committee for Research and Technical Support for Hollow Section Structures (CIDECT). CS consists of steel manufacturers, structural engineering consultants, contractors, architects and clients; SS involves BSI British Standards and European Committee for Standardisation, CEN; WS refers to the workforce involved in the activities associated with the aforesaid sectors, such as local workers in the steel mills. Benefits IS: The proposed research will provide further opportunities for IS to link academia and industry in steel tubular construction. It will enhance their leading role in construction industry through facilitating knowledge transfer programme between the proposed research and the use by the UK construction sector. This research will also supply highly trained researchers for recruitment. CS: Corus Tubes are the main supplier of structural tubes in the UK. The research findings will promote the use of tubular columns in steel-framed buildings and hence increase sales of steel sections. It also strengthens hollow section competitiveness and market shares in Europe and world-wide. For the structural engineering consultants, the research findings will also facilitate the use of semi-rigid through-diaphragm connection and tubular columns in their statement projects worldwide. Contractors can also reduce cost and time of fabrication without the need of fabricating complicated fully-rigid joints. Architects and Clients will benefit because the structural forms enhance the aesthetics and eliminate the need of bracing systems. In general, the proposed research will provide accessibility for the CS to latest research findings, contact with international networks of academics and cutting-edge technology. It will supply highly skilled researchers for recruitment and provide continuing professional development for staff and management. SS: The proposed design rules validated by structural performance data will facilitate the incorporation in the NCCI and Eurocode 3 for steel structures which will promote harmonization and trade in sustainable steel framed structures among European countries and world-wide. WS: The impact involves training of technicians at the host organisation and job creation in IS and CS which will promote the regional economy and in turn increase the tax revenue for the government. Benefits transfer activities To maximise the impact, the following measures will be undertaken: (i) Exposing research findings in public domain - the PI, PDRA and PGRS will present research findings at two major conferences and submit a technical note and two journal papers; (ii) Networking with beneficiaries - the PI and his research team will hold regular meetings with Arup, Corus Tubes and SCI to highlight latest research findings. The PI will also seek to establish research network with European and International research community; (iii) Transferring research findings into code of practice - the PI will facilitate the publication of design guidance through Corus Tubes, SCI and CIDECT. The PI will also aim to submit the research findings to national standardisation committee for incorporation as NCCI to support European Standards. The ultimate aim is to incorporate the research findings in Eurocode 3 through European Committee for Standardisation via CEN/TC250/SC3.

This new joint includes two diaphragm plates welded to the circumference of the column and bolted to the I-beam flanges with two tapered cover plates. A web stub is welded to the column face and bolted to the I-beam web. Numerical simulations were first conducted to characterize the physical attributes of the joint components. Full-scale laboratory experiments were then conducted to investigate the hysteretic response and energy dissipative performance of the proposed connection under cyclic loading. It is important to note that the tapered cover plates integrated in the connection act as replaceable sacrificial components that dissipate most of the energy whilst the rest of the joint components remain elastic to minimise the post-seismic repair. The key examined parameters of the tapered cover plates were the steel grade, size of the bolt-holes, use of stiffeners and the bolts preloading force. It was observed that the use of higher steel grades for the tapered cover plates and stiffening them imposed higher stress demands on the beam and diaphragm plates and dissipated less energy than the connections with lower grades and unstiffened tapered cover plates respectively. The results confirmed that the main energy dissipation fuse in these connections was yielding in the tapered cover plates while the other components remained elastic. It was also observed that connection slip created a second fuse of energy dissipation when bolts preloading force was properly controlled, and the proposed connection's rotation exceeded the minimum threshold of 25mrad for medium ductility class structures.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Academic:
The generated fundamental experimental and numerical data can be used by other researchers to develop their research programme on semi-rigid connections between steel I-beam and tubular column for the use in steel-framed buildings. The key parameters examined in this research can pave the way for further research on how to optimize the design. Currently, based on the research outcomes, the PI is collaborating with a research team in China to further optimize the design configurations. 

Non-academic:
Through technical seminars, it can raise the non-academic's awareness on the use of semi-rigid connections, particularly in the construction sector. Colleagues in this sector can build up their understanding on the current commonly used tubular connections and the proposed connection configurations.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8EEA254A-6AE6-44E1-AA4B-BF53A54BA198</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dcda2ff392d9.71834937</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Construction</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A0AB042E-8209-4BA4-886E-4B87492AEC43</gtr:id><gtr:title>Structural behavior of external diaphragm connection between steel I-section beam and circular hollow section columns under cyclic loading</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/85b2387f5f5eed2041f50f3ade3b80c3"><gtr:id>85b2387f5f5eed2041f50f3ade3b80c3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Khador, M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56d010f146ad12.10014987</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>606097E9-D533-4D68-92F5-3675C273F998</gtr:id><gtr:title>Detailing of I-beam-to-CHS column joints with external diaphragm plates for seismic actions</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Constructional Steel Research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/516075c9dbeb89f0bf0369a294f75401"><gtr:id>516075c9dbeb89f0bf0369a294f75401</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bagheri Sabbagh A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cff9ff9627c9cd</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>782116D9-D89B-42AF-9AC7-666529AAA4F7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Cyclic behaviour of external diaphragm joint to CHS column with built-in replaceable links</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Steel Construction</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d3ea637f147d419b62140fe63ab6add1"><gtr:id>d3ea637f147d419b62140fe63ab6add1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Khador M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58bb72d8ef9bf0.12246868</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6F232EB2-5070-4F48-85AC-4D27F2CA3910</gtr:id><gtr:title>Structural behavior of external diaphragm connection between steel I-section beam and circular hollow section column under cyclic loading</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/04ac786a2bbfad1d71244bd375f30f54"><gtr:id>04ac786a2bbfad1d71244bd375f30f54</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Khador, M.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56d0118b3189f2.81382255</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E3B40925-1101-4C12-8128-FB93E25A4F19</gtr:id><gtr:title>Test and analysis on the seismic performance of a steel truss-to-circular CFT column sub-assembly</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Constructional Steel Research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5a4e3979f177e6ad9e72d3a5c818988a"><gtr:id>5a4e3979f177e6ad9e72d3a5c818988a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Li Z</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545dd6910bb997.29637235</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>93927114-8726-4559-A189-218FA60602C6</gtr:id><gtr:title>Tubular Structures XV - Proceedings of the 15th International Symposium on Tubular Structures, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 27-29 May 2015</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d3ea637f147d419b62140fe63ab6add1"><gtr:id>d3ea637f147d419b62140fe63ab6add1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Khador M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56d01010301840.01154972</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/I020489/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C087E953-30F3-4968-B0F3-D48A5998A2B4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Civil eng. &amp; built environment</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3DA0C45A-BB41-4C35-A977-05FCC6966C8C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials testing &amp; eng.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>153EEBDB-0E76-4210-9687-2E4C43AE8DFF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Structural Engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
