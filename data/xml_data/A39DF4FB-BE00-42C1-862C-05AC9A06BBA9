A flagship, award winning, initiative, the UK in a Changing Europe (UKICE), has established a unique position as a forum and platform for communicating expert analysis with diverse public audiences, work with various media outlets and specialist support for government and civil society organisations. 25 ESRC Brexit Priority Grants are conducting urgent, applied research relevant to the Brexit negotiations in support of UKICE. Well-developed post-Priority Grant plans are in place for research to analyse, think-though and lay longer-term social, economic, spatial, legal and political foundations for 'Governance after Brexit'.
The Leadership Coordination Fellow has the core purpose of maximising the overall value added by the Priority Grants (with UKICE) and Governance after Brexit. Beyond project-specific contributions, their full potential is collective and requires collaboration, cooperation and co-ordination. The Fellow needs experience and skill as an academic leader. 
At least for the Priority Grants, the Fellow will work hand-in-glove with UKICE, particularly its Director Prof Anand Menon, Communications Officer, Ben Miller and Office Manager, Pheobe Couzens. UKICE has developed a unique position as an expert and impartial platform for expert input to an often febrile and disputatious debate around Brexit and as a forum for balanced contributions from protagonists. Prof Menon has a distinctively calm, engaging and expert voice on Brexit. 
Working with UKICE, the Fellow's role is to facilitate Priority Grant engagement particularly with governments but also with parliaments, the judiciary, civil society organisations and the wider public. As well as operating across the three main branches of government and beyond them to civil society, it needs to function across and connect the UK's nations, regions and localities. Subsequently, the Fellow will play a similar, but more independent role in the Governance after Brexit programme. There will be some scope, at least initially, to continue the partnership with UKICE. 
To reach its potential, the Brexit portfolio must draw on diverse academic disciplines and integrate their work effectively. UKICE and the Priority Grants have successfully engendered several inter- and trans-disciplinary research teams. For Governance after Brexit, the range should expand to include stronger elements that draw from such disciplines as geography, sociology, social policy, anthropology, law and/or history. 
To maximise the impact of its Brexit-related work, this research portfolio should be connected to other ESRC investments, notably a project 'Between two Unions' on the UK as a and major on-going investments on the economy and public attitudes. A range of centres and investments dealing with such issues as population, migration, civil society, housing and productivity are also making relevant contributions. In addition, connections with research supported by other funders would be valuable.
As well as existing investments, this issues raised by Brexit are reshaping the social science research agenda. The Fellow has a horizon-scanning and scoping role to play in relation to future research priorities, including programmes already being planned in the UK and across Europe. Moreover, if Brexit is a UK process, it can also be thought of as a local instance of a wider set of phenomena, which have had an impact in a number of other societies across the world. New research should address these wider phenomena in their comparative and global contexts.
Finally, Brexit and related developments pose challenges to the social sciences. Some have questioned the credibility of polling research that failed to predict Brexit (just as the economic crash weakened the credibility of economics). Reflection on fundamental social science approaches, concepts and methods will be one element of the Fellow's scoping work.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Making an impact with academic research is central to the Fellow's role. Its impact aspect will alter as the role's balance changes over time. Initially, coordinating the Brexit Priority Grants to maximising their collective value and link them to research users through UK in a Changing Europe is a priority. That initiative has built a superb, awarding winning communication and engagement platform. I have an established, effective working relationship with its Director (we co-edited a 2016 Brexit 'Political Quarterly' edition). I served as Chair of the UKICE Advisory Group at an earlier period. As Fellow, I would participate actively in the full range of engagement and impact work of the Changing Europe initiative and Priority Grantholders. At least for its initial period, 'Governance after Brexit' could also make use of the 'Changing Europe' platform, but I would also play a more prominent engagement role as its Coordinator. 

Governments across the UK are key impact partners in this work, with civil servants in Whitehall, Belfast, Cardiff and Edinburgh especially important partners. Across the portfolio, maintaining both independence and relationships of mutual trust with a range of policy actors from across the UK is a key requirement for the success of this post. The Fellow may have some scope to mediate among governments and with other interested actors.
The withdrawal legislation and post-Brexit developments will pose significant challenges to Westminster and to the devolved legislatures. New ways of Parliamentary working are likely to develop, probably ad hoc. I would aim to help set those changes in a broader conceptual and constitutional framework, to bolster UK representative democratic practice. The judiciary and legal professions are also priorities for engagement. In practice, post-Brexit, the constitution will change through the interplay of the three branches of government. 
Civil society organisations - business, unions and third sector organisations (TSOs) are also important partners. I am well placed to enhance the hitherto somewhat underplayed involvement of TSOs in this ESRC portfolio, with a particular focus on TSOs working on issues of gender and of equalities.
The UK in a Changing Europe has a strong media presence and good record of engagement with wider publics. As well as strengthening work in London, I would deploy the Priority Grants and wider ESRC investments to ensure a good spread of activity across the UK. Engaging audiences and partners outside the UK is an important element of some Priority Grants, to inform the Article 50 negotiations, and may grow in the next phases of 'Changing Europe' activity. It will also be an important element of the Fellow's wider scoping work. 

The Fellow will facilitate impact partners' access to outstanding applied research on Brexit, and then to a growing body of new longer term and conceptual work on the wider issues it raises. By sustaining trust relationships with the range of key impact partners, the Fellow will develop capacity to feed their priorities and perspectives into the shaping and framing of new research programmes. This role will emulate, but go beyond the established good practice of involving non-academic partners as co-designers of individual projects. As Brexit, and similar events elsewhere in the world, have also challenged some aspects of social science, these perspectives would also contribute to the Coordinator Fellow's work in scoping fundamental research with potential to reshape key aspects of social science. The nodal and networked coordination position also allows the Fellow potentially to serve as an intermediary between various actors and institutions. There may be potential for the Coordinator to use this portfolio to create private spaces for governments and intergovernmental groups to work through ideas and possibilities for and after Brexit. Other impact partners could be offered similar opportunities.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>333740</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/R007500/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4511FB20-8392-418E-809D-7701FACC03C9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Law &amp; legal studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9A4CA3E5-9CDA-4B38-9C9E-5F8023D4603E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>EU Law</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>754F2ED0-AD87-4B89-BE75-A37A5A5BF77D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>European/EU Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A7A7771C-0BD1-472E-BDD3-CB8A79BDF410</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Internat.
