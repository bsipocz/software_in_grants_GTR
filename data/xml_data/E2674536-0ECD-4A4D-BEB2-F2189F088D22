In the past, the region has suffered several decades of severe droughts, whilst more recently major flood events have struck a number of the region's rapidly expanding cities. The consequences of these climatic extremes for the population have been particularly pronounced due to widespread and severe poverty. Global climate change, coming on top of such a variable and unpredictable regional climate, poses a major threat to the populations and economies of West Africa. Although the pathway from climate change to human suffering in West Africa is very short, there are some key bottlenecks to using climate projections to mitigate against risks to the population. Critical gaps exist in knowledge of how West African climate will change over the course of the 21st century, and the uncertainties make it almost impossible for agencies to deliver well-informed plans for the coming decades in critical areas such as food security, urban development and water. Even with the best climate information, it remains a significant challenge to integrate the scientific knowledge into planning and management structures. This collaborative project between scientists and policy makers in West Africa and Europe will, on the one hand, increase understanding of the regional climate and how it will change, and on the other, apply that knowledge to practical development questions.

One of the key challenges for climate science is to understand how the changing composition of the atmosphere (notably CO2) will impact on the frequency and intensity of extreme events such as floods and droughts. In West Africa, these events are tied to the behaviour of convective rain storms; when storms are particularly intense or occur in rapid succession, devastating floods may result, whilst a week or two without storms during the wet season can trigger crop failure. Climate scientists rely on computer simulations of the global atmosphere, oceans and continents, yet these models have a very crude description of convective storms. For the first time, a new generation of regional climate models is emerging which realistically depict storms, and critically, how storms respond to factors such as land and ocean conditions, and increases in CO2. AMMA-2050 will use these new computer simulations alongside conventional climate models and historical observations, to understand why the statistics of key climate extremes are changing, and what this tells us about climate and its extremes in future decades. 

The outputs from the models will be used to examine impacts on key sectors in West African society, notably water and agriculture. Adaptation options will be explored, for example through the use of alternative crops, taking account of the inherent uncertainties in climate information, and the ways in which it is interpreted by decision-makers. We will focus on two questions. Firstly, in Senegal we will identify sustainable agricultural adaptation strategies and the policy frameworks to support those options. Secondly, we will examine how climate changes are likely to affect flooding in the rapidly growing city of Ouagadougou in Burkina Faso. The research and capacity building work of AMMA-2050 will help develop a new generation of African researchers and decision-makers, well-placed to respond to the requirements of West African nations. Within AMMA-2050, end-users have an important role, and their needs are embedded in project design and delivery, such that outputs will be responsive to their needs, and delivered in a format that is easily used. Enhanced resilience is an important aim of the project: it starts with improving our understanding of the climate signal over West Africa and leads through to decisions being made in specific pilot studies that showcase the importance of using improved and impact-sensitive science outputs.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The primary impacts of AMMA-2050 will be: the enhanced uptake of the products of climate science in medium term decision-making in West Africa; and the growth of regional expertise in climate science, its impacts and the science-decision making interface.

The AMMA-2050 project combines novel scientific excellence along with fully integrated participation of stakeholders. We are building on the community of researchers and operational partners established in AMMA since 2003, which already has a strong track record of collaborative, multidisciplinary and impact-focused science. Within AMMA-2050 we aim to use this community to derive practical impact from our research, and to demonstrate specific applications of robust climate projections to planning in the agricultural and urban flood-risk sectors. 

In order to deliver impact in the use of reliable climate information in these sectors, it is necessary to address the fundamental weaknesses in current climate science and the information it delivers. This physical science research in Pillar 1 of the project will be conducted in very close cooperation with a programme of applied research (Pillar 2) and practical demonstration projects (Pillar 3). Sustained communication among these groups is essential to the delivery of practical outputs that are relevant to users. For example, key measures of high-impact climatic quantities (drought, flooding etc) will be defined within the whole consortium and coordinated at the top level, so that such measures are both useful to users within the demonstration projects, and scientifically rigorous in the climate models. Furthermore, the credibility of climate information relies on the transparent evaluation of the information in terms of its accuracy and reliability. The legitimacy of the climate information will be ensured by the co-production of knowledge by institutions in Africa and Europe and by stakeholders and scientists working together on the project. Since excellent science is a major driver of the work of AMMA-2050, we aim to publish our results in the top peer-reviewed journals, and present the research at national and international meetings. 

Existing partnerships and networks are the foundation upon which our communications are built. Within AMMA-2050, stakeholders have a defined role in ensuring the work is demand-led. Our knowledge exchange activities will draw on the networks our partners have in West Africa as well as involving boundary organisations such as the CCKE-Unit. Ongoing engagement of these organisations will ensure outputs of AMMA-2050 are communicated beyond our original list of stakeholders to a wider audience of interest groups. In this, we will work with regional and international agencies such as the Volta Basin Authority (VBA), the Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) programme, the African Centre of Meteorological Application for Development (ACMAD), the Economic Community Of West African States (ECOWAS), and government departments such as the Direction de la Gestion et de la Planification des Ressources en Eau (DGPRE) in Dakar.

The capacity building activities of AMMA-2050 will involve a balance of staff time visiting African and European research centres and policy placements totalling more than 60 months. Alongside attendance at international conferences and annual consortium meetings, plus significant leadership roles, the project will help to develop a skilled workforce and a new generation of leaders in African research. The ultimate beneficiaries of AMMA-2050 will be the populations of West Africa, who will benefit from more effective use of climate information in planning for an uncertain future. This is particularly so in the key areas of food security, via informed adaptive cropping and agricultural policies, and cities which are resilient to future flood risk.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>251372</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Emerging economic and societal impact arising from AMMA2050:

Participatory impact pathway analysis (PIPA) is a practical planning and evaluation approach developed for use with complex research for-development
activities. PIPA is initiated with the conduct of a participatory workshop where stakeholders make explicit their project's impact pathways (that is, the assumptions and hypotheses
about how their project will achieve an impact, also known as &amp;quot;theory of change&amp;quot;). Here we apply this to approach to the two pilot studies in the AMMA2050 project. 

PIPA has a number of stages including the Construction of problem trees; Visioning; Developing a network perspective and Defining the outcomes logic
model . In the 'Construction of problem trees participants begin by clarifying the cause-and effect logic of their projects by drawing a problem tree that begins with the identification of problems the project could potentially address and ends with problems that the project will directly address. When working with several projects from the same program, presentations of problem trees help participants better understand each other's aims, a prerequisite for successful program integration.

Following this a 'Visioning' session is undertaken. Here participants describe a vision of project success 5 or more years in the future in terms of who is doing what differently, how project outputs will scale out and who will benefit. This is followed by a 'Developing a network perspective' session. PIPA balances the cause-and-effect logic of the
problem tree with a network perspective, in which impact results from interactions between actors are drawn within what is referred to as on 'innovation
system'. These interactions are modeled by drawing network maps that show important relationships between actors. Participants draw a 'now' network map showing current key relationships between stakeholders and a 'future' network map showing how stakeholders need to link together to achieve the project's vision. Participants then devise strategies to bring these changes about. The influence and attitude of actors are explicitly considered. 

In the Defining the outcomes logic model session the two descriptions of a project's impact pathways are integrated in the outcomes logic model. This
model describes in table format how stakeholders (i.e., next users, end users, politically important actors and project implementers) should
act differently if the project is to achieve its vision. Each row describes changes in a particular actor's knowledge, attitude, skills (KAS) and practice, and strategies to bring these changes about. The strategies include research to develop project outputs with next users and end users who
subsequently employ them.</gtr:description><gtr:id>C80C9DE6-AAC6-4862-A0C1-ADE79A35BCF1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Development of impact logic models for Work packages 5 and 6 of AMMA2050.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b412d12bf7d1.73955379</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Participatory Impacts Pathways Analysis (PIPA) for building the resilience of agriculture in Senegal to climate change/planning for flood risk in Burkina Faso</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2017</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>1. Theoretical approach to understanding different discourses on climate knowledge and uncertainty
Foucault described discourse as 'the general domain of all statements, sometimes as an individualised group of statements, and sometimes as a regulated practice that account for a number of statements' (Foucault 1972:80). One can, therefore, visualise discourses as collective spaces in which people communicate and act according to a common understanding of the collective norm. In turn, according to Foucault, the function of power within this space is to regulate people who accidentally or intentionally step outside of the norm. Associated with power and discourse, Foucault saw knowledge as working as a reminder of the norm as well as a disciplining element on how to think and behave. Relating this to the realm of climate change it can be seen that people will try to adapt to climate related hazards based on their discursive knowledge. This knowledge also determines what they consider as unsafe and uncertain. Sometimes, the knowledge flowing through a discourse, ends up trapping people in vulnerabilities by limiting their behaviour or freedom to make decisions. To give an example again from Bangladesh, people dealing with cyclone strikes may consider evacuation to a cyclone shelter upon receiving a warning message as one logical way to find safety and certainty. It is an adaptive pathway to deal with the environmental stress. However, a young unmarried woman in Bangladesh may decide not to evacuate to a public shelter as in some areas this is seen as an 'inappropriate behaviour'. In some areas of southern Bangladesh, 'a woman's place is seen at home, she is safe at home, and she should not leave the house'; not even when a cyclone is approaching. For an unmarried woman she may place a higher importance of the knowledge that suggests if she gets raped in the shelter or on the way to the shelter or even is thought by others to have been assaulted, she may never marry and would become an economic 'burden' to her family. To her she is, therefore, safer trying to survive the cyclone at home, than by putting her 'social status' at risk in the shelter or outside the house. This is an example of how discursive 'knowledge' within a place can constrain or trap someone into a seemingly (from another perspective) vulnerable position.
In terms of responding to climate change Eriksen et al. (2015) used Foucault's theoretical framework of discourse, power and knowledge to show how identity, space and the social world (in terms of subjectivities ) are produced and in turn enable or constrain people's ability to act. In other words, they illustrated how people's behaviour, including their responses to climatic stress such as adaptation strategies, are determined by their discourses, power and knowledge. In this conception adaptation strategies are viewed as socio-political processes that reveal how individuals and collectives interrelate with one and another as well as environmental and social changes or disruptions (Eriksen et al. 2015). In line with Eriksen et al. (2015) we argue that there is a need to reframe adaptation policy, practices and analysis to involve multiple adaptation knowledges that better question subjectivities trapped within discursive problems, understandings and vulnerabilities. In particular, we argue that ideas of knowledge and uncertainty are bound up with the dynamic outcomes and situations in which uncertainty is expressed. We especially posit the idea that related to different discourses of knowledge and uncertainty is the idea of positioning 'oneself' (or the object of a decision or situation) along a continuum of whether the use of this knowledge and uncertainty allows us to be safe, unsafe or a position in between. Thus rather than confusing certainty with safety we use a conceptualisation of a decision/behaviour space that is contained within the orthogonal axes from certainty to uncertainty and unsafety to safety (see Figure 1 from Mason 1993:195) where the spectrum of certainty to uncertainty pertains to knowledge of climate risks and that of unsafe to safe is associated with how one sees one's livelihood or outcome of a decision.

 
The concept of 'safe uncertainty' is used widely in the discipline of family therapy to manage risk and change within therapy (Mason 1993). Here the space of 'safe uncertainty' is seen as 'always in a state of flow, and is consistent with the notion of a respectful, collaborative, evolving narrative, one which allows a context to emerge whereby new explanations can be placed alongside rather than instead of, in competition with, the explanations that clients and therapists bring' (Mason 1993). Likewise, in a climate changed world we characterise the 'safe uncertainty' space as one which promotes dialogue and learning through the contribution of different stakeholder's views with varying understandings of knowledge and purpose to form different adaptive pathways which are flexible, robust and low-regrets (Ranger et al. 2013). Relating back to the work of Foucault we posit that movement within the larger space of certainty to uncertainty and unsafe to safety requires a recognition of the role of power, knowledge and discourse. Here the issue is that uncertainty does not preclude safety and that understanding one's position in this space benefits from different perspectives/knowledges through dialogue. In many respects the need for pluralism and dialogue repeats the arguments for the adaptive co-management of complex socio-ecological systems (Armitage et al. 2009). Clearly, key to this conception is the recognition of the subjectivity of what is considered certain and uncertain, or safe and unsafe. For example, one person living in the urban capital of Bangladesh, Dhaka, may define someone-else's living condition in the rural and cyclone affected coast of Bangladesh as highly unsafe or uncertain. However, that very same person may point out that it is much safer to live in the rural coast than within the urban dangers of Dhaka.
The developed approach (Fox et al, in review) uses the above conceptual framework to understand different climate change adaptive pathways, illustrated with a case study from the Peanut basin in Senegal. In doing so it highlights the concepts of 'safe uncertainty' (an acceptance of uncertainty as not limiting) and 'unsafe certainty' (a misplaced concept of safety). While power, knowledge and discourse are clearly important in defining the positionality of someone/institution/community in this space it in turn also helps illuminate how to move within this space and thus reveal pathways to adaptation. Expanding adaptation to include transformation, defined as non-linear or dramatic changes, the approach lays the basis for opening up space for questions about preferences and power that have received relatively little focus within the scientific debate on adaptation theory (Pelling et al. 2015; O'Brien 2012).</gtr:description><gtr:id>A9BA9F2D-BAC2-44F0-84FC-3D3E44426C34</gtr:id><gtr:impact>4. Climate uncertainty discourses and adaptive pathways in Senegal
Rainfall variability in West Africa over recent decades is considered to be among the most extreme in the world. For example, the drought that started at the end of the 1960s is now recognized as one of the strongest climatic signals since meteorological measurements began (Hulme et al. 2001). The high vulnerability of many in the region has meant that past climate extremes have led to high losses in lives and livelihoods resulting in the impoverishment and displacement of many. Since the droughts of the 1970s and 80s while there has been a partial recovery of the rains, many urban areas now suffer from an increase in severe flooding. 
Scientifically, there is a solid physical understanding of the causes of historical climate variability in the region. Yet, currently there is no consensus on how changes in greenhouse gases, land cover and aerosols will impact future rainfall, in terms of the seasonal total and its distribution within the wet season. Importantly, in terms of societal impact, there is sparse information on how high impact weather (HIW) events may change in the future. This uncertainty, coupled with a weak capability to plan investments on timescales of decades, results in a paucity of climate change knowledge being used as a guide to development decision-making.
In this context, the multi-institutional African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis, AMMA-2050 project aims: (1) to provide expert judgement on future projections of HIW; (2) to create tools and methodologies for using these projections for planning within the agricultural and hydrological sectors; and, (3) to demonstrate the potential for effective application of reliable 5-40 year climate projections and associated uncertainties in regional to local scale decision-making. One of the focuses of AMMA-2050 is building the resilience of agriculture to climate change. Based in Senegal, the relevant pilot study in the project aims to establish a planning and policy framework which bridges the knowledge gap between climate scientists and the agricultural planning processes. Involving key actors (farmers, scientists, policymakers, extension agents, NGOs), the project has documenting and is trialling existing and new resilient agricultural practices, including collaborative cultivar breeding strategies, with the potential to increase adaptive capacity in the study area that might be up-scaled to other parts of West Africa. As part of this process a number of focus groups discussions have been held to understand the different perspectives on climate knowledge, uncertainty and adaptive pathways. The following results come from two such focus group discussions held with stakeholders from the Fatick district of the Peanut Basin in Senegal. The Fatick district experiences a Sudano-Sahelian climate, characterised by high temperatures (28.1&amp;deg;C for 1980-2013) and low rainfall (474 mm for 980-2013), with wet season occurring between mid-June and, mid-September (Salack et al. 2011). The area is characterised by a high level of naturally saline soils and salinized soils due to land degradation (17% of total land; Diome and Tine 2015). To adapt to high inter-annual variability of rainfall, farmers in this area had developed low risks strategies (low inputs and low but stable yields) that has placed them in a position of 'safe uncertainty'. However, in the context of climate change with fears of increasing variability and extreme weather combined with a desire for improved food security and livelihoods, farmers of the Peanut Basin are back in the 'unsafe uncertainty' place. 
Stakeholders in the focus group discussions included members of Fatick Regional Committee for Climate Change (COMMREC), government officials and community representatives. To initiate discussion within the groups the conceptual basis shown in Figure 1 was drawn and the participants asked to locate climate risks to rural livelihoods (group 1) and future climate change impacts on rural livelihoods (group 2). The participants were asked to consider all of their climate knowledge including from scientific, experiential, local indigenous and traditional sources. To help illustrate the task, examples of households in the four spaces in Figure 1 were given. For instance a household on a hill by the sea was given as someone who considered them certain and safe with regard to flood risk; of a household at sea level which is inundated by storm surges but who does not know when they will occur as uncertain and unsafe; of a household who presently had never been affected by storm surges but with sea level rise and an intensification of cyclones with global warming would be considered as unsafe and certain; and, that of a uncertain but safe household as one which existed at sea level but received and acted upon early warnings of approaching storm surges. The participants were also asked what changes could they envisage that could help reposition themselves in a positions of safety, either 'safe certainty' or 'safe uncertainty'. Figures 2 and 3 give the details of these focus group discussions. According to Group 1 salinization of soils and extreme events were seen as placing people in an 'unsafe certainty' space as extreme events always happen and salinization existed. To move household suffering from these issues to a 'safe certain' space the participants highlighted the use of seasonal forecasts and the local development plan that restricts use of the salinized land. Later discussions then focused on whether the seasonal forecasts were certain and accurate and that the use of salinity affected land was a result of local population pressure, a land grab and impoverished households. In terms of 'unsafe uncertainty' the issues of a lack of knowledge of the wet season onset and end dates, the post wet season rain spells, the occurrence of long dry spells, strong wind events and the rainfall distribution during the wet season were all seen as increasing agricultural livelihood vulnerability. Pathways to move to a 'safe uncertainty' space included better climate information, the establishment of windbreaks (including the planting of trees and the development of agroforestry), the adoption of water retention technology such as Zai pits and encouraging plant diversity. Interestingly it was also suggested that to move from a situation of 'unsafe uncertainty' to one of 'safe certainty' households or members of households could migrate. The following discussion included whether such migration might however in certain situations lead to 'unsafe certainty' as households relocated to slum areas that were prone to urban flash flooding or whilst reducing climate vulnerability might increase economic vulnerability.
Group 2 participants identified that their knowledge of change of the rainfall profile, an increase of temperatures, having not enough seed varieties adapted for different conditions, limited access to fields (e.g. because of ownership, degradation and salinization), poor investment and access to finance and irrigation meant that rural livelihoods were in a position of 'unsafe certainty'. Whereas the lack of knowledge of wet season onset dates, the lack of use of climate change information and the lack of harmonisation of the agricultural production chain and access to markets placed them in a position of 'unsafe uncertainty'. Discussions on moving towards safer areas including developing early warnings of onset dates, a change in culture to planning based on early warnings and local access to different varieties of cultivars. 
The approach outlined above provides a fertile landscape to start the process of identifying pathways of adaptation to climate risks and change as envisaged by local stakeholders in Senegal. In this conception the two dimensional conceptual space of 'safety and certainty' is influenced by a third dimension, power. Power plays a significant role in shaping the direction of adaptive pathways which is often ignored in more quantitative approaches. In focus group discussions participants gave a host of reasons why most of their peers occupied an uncomfortable space of 'unsafe uncertainty' and 'unsafe certainty'. Interestingly, the certainties that they identified were issues that they saw beyond their control such as increased temperatures and changes in rainfall. For example, a farmer's inability to move towards 'safe certainty' was explained by most importantly not having direct access to technological climate information/knowledge. They even stated that knowledge or 'precise information' is more important than economic means. One may have money, but if (s)he spends it wrongly, due to the lack of information, (s)he will end up losing it. For example, if one ends up planting the wrong seeds at the wrong time, (s)he will lose his crops. 
The focus groups also introduced another interesting element in the description between knowledges. In the space of 'safe certainty', or what is required to reach 'safe certainty', participants explained that one will need precise information or tools to measure precise information to be able to make such a move. There is also an element of knowing how to use the climate information and a financial element to being able to use the information. At the same time, the respondents described how traditional knowledge is what constraints, keep or maintain people within the space of 'unsafe uncertainty'. In this case traditional knowledge was not valued as highly as the technological knowledge.
