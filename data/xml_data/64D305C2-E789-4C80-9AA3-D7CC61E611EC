The French State, Artists and Academy, 1830-1852</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/H008071/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Over the last forty years the extensive reappraisal of the history of French art of the nineteenth century, of which the creation of the Mus&amp;eacute;e d'Orsay, inaugurated in 1986, is the most visible public embodiment, has not to date been accompanied by a corresponding reappraisal of the role of the French institutions for which this art was created and through which it reached its public and patrons. The most important of these institutions was the annual or biennial exhibition of contemporary art held in Paris during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and known as the Salon, yet despite its importance, there exists no serious history of this exhibition. This project aims i) to lay the groundwork for this history by establishing its framework and methodology and ii) to produce the first significant critical mass of research on this history by targeting one of its decisive phases, that of the period 1830-1852, comprising the July Monarchy (1830-1848) and Second Republic (1848-1852) and marked by the regime changes resulting from the revolutions of 1830 and 1848 and Louis-Napoleon's coup d'&amp;eacute;tat of December 1851.\n\nAs the French art historian G.-G. Lemaire stated in 1988 in Esquisses en vue d'une histoire du Salon, the Paris Fine Art Salon was unique among European art institutions in being tied so closely and for such a long period to the institutions of the State. Artists worked for the Salon, which provided essential access to state commissions, purchases and honours, as well as to private buyers. It was a key site in which the major contemporary artistic and cultural debates and confrontations were played out and was a major event in the Parisian nineteenth-century annual or biennial social and cultural calendar, attracting huge crowds over a period of three months or more. It was central to the development of art journalism from 1836. For these reasons Lemaire argued that in the nineteenth century French art and the Salon formed a single history, the one insepable from the other. \n\nThis 'single history' view of the Paris Fine Art Salon has, however, been largely prejudicial to our understanding of its wider role in the history of French art for it has reinforced the reductive view of the history of the Salon as that of the individual works, artists, artistic styles, movements or genres shown there. Aligned in this way with the story of modern art and its construction of the avant-garde, the Salon's role has been reduced to that of a conservative institution hostile to the work of innovative art or artists. This project aims to replace this limited representation of the Salon's role with the first study of the Salon as a network of relationships bringing together government policy, administrative structures and artistic and cultural practices in an institution for which art was produced, through which it was circulated and in which it was analysed or ignored, sold or returned unsold. \n \nThe project will build on work already in progress in the two research groups with which the Principal Investigator has been engaged since 2003, as co-editor of the critical edition of the Salon reviews published by Th&amp;eacute;ophile Gautier, France's most important art journalist of the period 1830-1872, and of a collection of essays on the history of the Salon, 1791-1890, to be published in the autumn of 2009. It will generate a critical mass of new published research (one co-authored book, one co-edited volume of conference proceedings, one co-authored dual-language English/French exhibition catalogue and one PhD thesis) designed to embed the institutional dimension in future art historical research, and an exhibition whose aim will be to educate the public and the wider academic community into the significance of the institutional dimension in cultural and art history. \n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Not required</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>271842</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>'Peindre pour le Salon?

The funding of this project enabled my team and me to carry out the first detailed study of the exhibition during the period of the July Monarchy (1830-1848) and Second Republic (1848-1851). We brought new information and insights on a whole range of issues: the exhibition's role in Paris's reputation as the world's capital of the fine arts, its legislative and management framework, its relationship to domestic political change, its place in changing forms of art patronage, and many others. In association with the managers of the Louvre's archives, we created a database of over 80,000 works submitted to the Salon by more than 9,000 artists during the 1830-51 period, thereby enabling a far wider public to interrogate the Salon's catalogues according to a range of criteria (the artist's age, sex, choice of genre, subject, etc). In September 2013 we presented our findings at an international conference in the context of the exhibition's wider 1791-1881 phase and in September - November 2013 we mounted a two-month public exhibition on the history of the Salon.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The database is available to all for future research.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>2EEF5FFD-B1C9-4DEA-A16B-0EEFCB519158</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56ec5518184451.88939641</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.salonartists.org</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Database of Salon Artists, 1827-1850: A Record of Salon Entries from 1827 to 1850, developed in collaboration with the Archives des Mus&amp;eacute;es nationaux, Louvre Museum.
