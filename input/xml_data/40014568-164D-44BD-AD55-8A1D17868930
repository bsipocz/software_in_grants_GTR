The city of Rome is central to most broad reconstructions of European history, and the period between the sixth and the tenth centuries is accepted as having been crucial in its development. But while historians of Rome have noted numerous inconsistencies in their evidence and in the messages drawn from it, the city's position in wider history has remained relatively simple: ceasing to be the capital of an empire, in those centuries Rome became instead the city of the popes. Recent work on individual aspects of Rome's history in the early middle ages, and the evidence for it, underlines the necessity for a revised synthesis that incorporates this work into a new overarching account that based on a critical appraisal of the sources.\n\nThe traditional story of rising papal domination relegates to more minor roles two sets of people whose influence on the city's history, I will argue, was decisive: the rulers of the Frankish and Byzantine empires and their followers, and the vast majority of the population of the city itself, lay and clerical. It is the self-identification of the latter, in particular, that indicates Rome's true political and ideological position in these centuries. We have to be quite careful to discern their voices in sources written either outside the city - and often in association with Franks and Byzantines - or by papal writers. The latter emphasize the association of Rome's citizens with St Peter, the city's first bishop. But Romans themselves patronized the cults of other martyrs, built and staffed their own churches, and included a cadre of officials that developed a unique profile in this period. Rome's changing identity was therefore not simply a question of the city of Romulus becoming the city of St Peter, however weighty the transformation that that change signifies. It was in fact, and uniquely in this period of European history, a forum for distinct and often competing identities and associations.\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Beneficiaries of this research will include:-\nresearchers into the history of Rome\nresearchers into the history of the early middle ages\nresearchers into the history of the papacy\nresearchers into the history of the Catholic Church\nresearchers into any aspect of the culture of Rome\nresearchers into any aspect of the culture of the Catholic Church\nthose responsible for museums and galleries in or about Rome or the papacy\nvisitors to museums and galleries in or about Rome or the papacy\nRoman Catholics interested in the ideology and history of their faith\n\nSince the research offers a new history of the city of Rome in a period crucial for the development of its bishopric, the papacy, it has the potential to impact on all those for whom the history of Rome and the papacy has resonance. This will certainly include Roman Catholics interested in and debating the current ideology of their faith. Ultimately it may also include many for whom Rome is an object of cultural interest, since the story of the city's early medieval development is incorporated in the wider narratives that they encounter.\n\nTwo steps will be taken to disseminate the ideas in the book to a wider audience. \n1. a public event on the book's theme: the British School at Rome is an appropriate and plausible location for this event. \n2. an article for submission to a mainstream history publication, summarizing the conclusions of the book.\n\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>66876</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>CE91B4B1-275F-40C1-8345-E0759D9E6979</gtr:id><gtr:title>Documentary Culture and the Laity in the Early Middle Ages</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c788655f1cf941617dffbf86aaf96319"><gtr:id>c788655f1cf941617dffbf86aaf96319</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Costambeys M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781139177993</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>545cdf3fcfbe40.65765444</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I002650/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3CE20DB9-873E-489F-BBC7-3F05BD0D900C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
