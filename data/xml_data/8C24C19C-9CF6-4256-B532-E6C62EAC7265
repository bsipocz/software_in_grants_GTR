The question of language and writing are approached at their intersection of literature, new cultural literacies and installation art. The project seeks to renew our ideas about writing and shared public space, the impact of technology on language use and speech communities, and the impact of new literacies on memory and thought formation. Print has always favoured notions of dissemination, of transportable knowledge, of critical matter in circulation, yet electronic storage and digital practices already favour other kinds of literacies that shift the supremacy of the printed letter towards a realm of mixed reading and viewing codes (visual, audio, kinetic, even perceptual). Language itself always gets transformed and altered by the writing media it travels through. Opening up the spatio-temporal dimensions of writing questions the material and social bounds of readerliness and intelligibility, and the performance of cultural access. The installed project brings a structured multiplicity of approaches to the material, thus engaging the audience in multiple sensory and cognitive relays. This favours a personalised relation to the cultural material presented. \n\nThe research involves creating a space-surround environment of textual projections and mixed sound. Illuminated text panels are constructed so as to make the reader-viewer-listener feel that they are entering the pages of a three-dimensional book or a circular pool of animated and audiophonic writings. The piece as a whole is composed as a multimodal choral play, a performative archive of verbal and textual material, a space where multiple narratives interweave across platforms. The main narrative trope I am working from is that of British multilinguality, cultural and linguistic belonging/displacement, verbal inventions: What do we hear when others speak? How are we heard when we speak? How do we share what we remember of a text? \n\nFormally and compositionally, the materials for the piece come from a mixture of methods. It uses established literary models (visual text, multilingual poetics, choral performance, found text), audio technologies (voice recording, sound mix, spatial composition) and electronic tools (3D visuality, visual projections, spatial display techniques). The specific language material of the piece is reliant on a range of contemporary speaking and spelling conventions: from our current Standard English to uses arising from the widespread impact of English as second language, the shorthand of electronic communication such as texting, twittering, other forms of contemporary textual creoles, such as the polemical spellings that have emerged through the music world (hiphop, ragga, reggaeton, eurotrash) and the inventions of bicultural language speakers. \n\nExploration of writing that goes beyond print-based technologies to include audio-visual and electronic technologies demands both applied practice and sustained critical exploration to develop the artistic and critical tools appropriate for it. \nThe new languages of media and communication have a wide-ranging and long-term impact on literacy and on literature and are affecting the ways in which reading and writing are approached and perceived. Different modes of reading manifest different kinds of performativity and multimedia uses of language create new forms of engagement with socio-cultural material and processes of memory. Formalised learning and informal social interaction are increasingly taking place through multi-media means. The project seeks to emphasise the role that an expanded method of writing can play in an audio-visually and electronically seeped culture.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Both the short-term and long-term impact of this project will be extensive and will span many different areas and disciplines. In addition to the specialist academic audience, a more far-reaching community will be accessed via the John Hansard Gallery's educational and outreach activity. \n\nThe John Hansard Gallery has an ongoing programme of educational and access work to run alongside our exhibition programme, bringing in numerous groups and individuals, who may not normally attend exhibitions of contemporary art. This continues to be a very high priority within our overall programme of events. Working with local schools, colleges, disability groups, varying cultural/social groups, and socially excluded groups of young people; this remains at the core of our activity. In addition to its strong academic value in terms of research, this project lends itself to working with younger age groups very well; linking into young peoples' increasing use of texting, email, networking sites, 'Twitter' and blogging etc. Young people form a key part in the evolution of communication and language, therefore such a programme of participatory workshops and projects will provide very rich potential for engagement.\n\nIn terms of the academic reach of this project, detailed information is given with the Academic Beneficiaries section of this application. However, in brief, due to its interdisciplinary nature, the project's impact will be extensive. Encompassing both the more immediate academic audiences involved in Visual Arts practice, Performance, Poetry, Literature, and Literacy (both written and visual), and other disciplines including: Linguistics, Philosophy, Cultural Studies, Social Sciences etc. It is a broad multi-disciplinary academic audience that we would wish to engage with. Two practice-led research seminars with students at the University of Southampton and at Birkbeck College are also planned. \n\nFurther manifestations of the project will be developed in the form of a catalogue and a web presence. Both of these will extend the research beyond the confines of the Gallery based work and will enable further engagement on a broad level. \n\nWho will benefit:\nGallery audience: comprising national and local visitors, both general and academic audience.\nEducation and Outreach Programme: schoolchildren, community groups, socially excluded young people, disability groups, culturally diverse groups.\nArts professionals, peer organisations, visual artists and literary practitioners.\nAcademic researchers spanning different disciplines, eg: Visual Arts, Literature, Linguistics, Philosophy, Cultural Studies, Social Sciences. \nUndergraduate students, post-graduate and research students.\n\nHow will they benefit:\nArtist Talks &amp;amp; Guided Tours\nArtist Filmed Interview \nSchools and Children's Workshops \nWorkshops for Special Groups \nProjects with young people and socially excluded groups \nSeminars with specific student groups\nDistribution of catalogue\nWeb presence\n\nWhat will be done to ensure they benefit:\n\nFree access to exhibition and associated events.\nBroad programme of events aimed at a range of audiences in order to bring both general and professional groups to the exhibition.\nProduction of high quality publicity material / publication and distribution to both specialist and general audiences.\nTargeted press mailings to professional audiences and arts press.\nExtensive advertising in national art journals and placement of previews and listings in national and local press.\nNew programme of monitoring visitor attendance developed through Audience Development South East (ADSE).\nProgramme of evaluation of both educational projects and of Gallery visitors through encouragement and close monitoring of feedback.\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>16030</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/H030646/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DE53E60A-FE46-433C-BA16-151F707B335F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Creative Writing</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FB301405-099D-44B9-ADA9-75B11FDED8C0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>English Language &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>2D2B04A8-2CC9-41D9-B5EF-78E0AF1A8B24</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Installation &amp; Sound Art HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
