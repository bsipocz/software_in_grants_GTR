Different techniques have their own strengths and weaknesses and each offers a window on brain function with a different perspective. Two of the most common methods for measuring the amount and location of brain activity associated with different sensations, thoughts and feelings are electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). EEG records from electrodes attached to the scalp the electrical signals from co-ordinated activity of large numbers of nerve cells. FMRI, however, records using an MRI scanner, the local changes in blood oxygenation associated with alterations in neural activity. EEG has the advantage of being able to detect rapid changes in neural activity (millisecond temporal resolution) but suffers from a poor ability to pinpoint the location of brain activity (spatial resolution). FMRI, however, has good spatial resolution (a few millimetres) but poor temporal resolution (a few seconds) because the signal relies on changes in blood flow: the plumbing of the brain. FMRI and EEG can therefore be regarded as complementary with EEG giving the 'when' and fMRI giving the 'where' of brain activity.However, while very useful in research, doctors and scientists want also to develop these neuroimaging techniques for practical uses which rely on reading the state of the brain or measuring the activity of the brain. These include, but are not limited to, brain-computer interfaces (BCI, disabled patients using brain signals to control a device), assessment of the effects of new medicines targeted at the brain and the diagnosis of epilepsy (the type and source of seizures from within the brain). EEG has been used, for many years in some cases, in these applications and has the considerable advantage of being portable and comparatively cheap and therefore appropriate for a routine lab or clinical setting. Why is the usefulness of EEG limited? As we have seen, its spatial resolution is comparatively poor but it can also be insensitive because of many signals from the brain being present and mixing together. FMRI is a more recent technique able to discriminate very well different patterns of brain activity but requires an MRI scanner: clearly not portable and comparatively expensive. In research labs such as ours at Cardiff University Brain Research Imaging Centre (CUBRIC), it has become possible to perform EEG and fMRI simultaneously. Our research proposal aims to improve the ability of EEG to discriminate different brain states or responses to specific types of stimulation, such as pain, drugs or for control of BCIs. To exploit the day-to-day practical advantages of EEG we wish to improve its stand alone capabilities. We will use fMRI in this project to help us do this. How can fMRI help us to improve EEG? We will use EEG and fMRI measurements acquired simultaneously on healthy volunteers. We will relate these two types of measurements together in what it known as a statistical model derived from the data. This procedure will discover associations or correlations between the EEG and fMRI data. Subtle features of the EEG signal, which are not normally easily identified but which are associated with the spatial location of the source of neural activity, will be highlighted by their association with the fMRI data, which is good at pinpointing locations in space. Having established and codified the relationship between the EEG and fMRI data in mathematical terms, EEG data alone will be used to simulate fMRI scans. These simulated fMRI scans will be used, applying what we know about the representation of brain activity by fMRI, to interpret the EEG signal effectively improving its spatial resolution. This will improve the ability of EEG on its own to tell the difference between brain states for the uses in BCI, development of medicines and clinical conditions.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>There is potential for developing new mobile imaging techniques and equipment for brain analysis based on EEG and joint FMRI/EEG models, which would bring some of the advantages of the FMRI technology closer to the patient without the need for FMRI equipment. There is potential for a spin-off company taking advantage of the developed techniques. Cardiff University has a dedicated Research and Commercial Division with all the necessary systems in place for IP exploitation and a strong history of doing this successfully. The project has the long term potential to benefit the commercial private sector, the public healthcare sector and also charities concerned with the severely disabled, for whom brain computer interfaces may have benefits. Any improvement in EEG signal inversion algorithms that would permit categorisation of more than simplest tasks/classes would be of huge benefit to the brain computer interface (BCI) industry. Improved BCIs may have a role in helping impaired patients communicate. Such improved algorithms would be disseminated through presentation at well targeted industry meetings and would also be protected for potential commercial exploitation. There are additional healthcare benefits of successful EEG algorithms. EEG assists in the clinical diagnosis of different forms of epilepsy. The development of improved EEG models for identifying subtypes of epilepsy and their spatial distribution within the brain by the use of FMRI may permit these improved EEG models to be applied in the clinic. So far the use of combined EEG-FMRI has been largely to pinpoint epileptic foci. However, the use of FMRI to train a greater discriminative EEG procedure may have benefit at a lower cost for a greater number of patients. A long term impact could be the improved diagnosis, localisation and assessment of drug treatment (and side effects) in epilepsy. This potential benefit would initially be realised through collaboration with our clinical colleagues in the NHS (Dr Hamandi and his group and the Welsh Epilepsy Research Network) and through charitable funding agencies with which CUBRIC has an ongoing relationship (e.g. Waterloo Foundation). The UK pharmaceutical industry, in common with that in the rest of the world is experiencing ever increasing costs of bringing new therapeutic compounds to market. This threatens their long term success. Effective measurement technologies are needed to quantify drug effects, especially in the brain for neurological and psychiatric indications. Wise has ongoing collaborations with the pharmaceutical industry e.g. Pfizer UK Ltd, and previously Merck and GSK, to develop EEG and FMRI for assessing the effects of novel drugs in the human brain. These technologies are therefore beginning to assist in drug discovery and development. While FMRI is proving useful in this regard, EEG has the advantage of being more practical and widely available and measures neuronal activity more directly. Within Wise's group EEG and FMRI is being used to assess drug action especially in the field of pain, analgesia and sedation where we have experience. Wise meets regularly with those concerned with assessing technology in the UK pharmaceutical industry and therefore has a route to disseminating this research. Clinical monitoring of awareness and depth of sedation: EEG-based monitoring systems exist for this (e.g. bi-spectral monitoring). However, the development of such EEG devices would benefit from a stronger neuroanatomical and systems-neuroscience foundation which could be provided by the proposed contribution to EEG analysis from FMRI data. CUBRIC works closely with anaesthetists in researching the brain in sedation using EEG-FMRI. We therefore have the opportunity to test algorithms directly and develop our approaches with clinical practitioners as well as in collaboration with a commercial partner with whom we have had early discussions on depth of anaesthetic monitoring (ANT, Berlin).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>106381</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University College London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Neurophysiology of pain</gtr:description><gtr:id>696C9D58-105E-4E6E-8866-9553AE35A169</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Grant applications in preparation.

EEG is a cheaper and more portable technique than fMRI, which requires a large MRI scanner. EEG, therefore has greater potential for use in hospitals and in research to evaluate the effects of new drugs on the brain.



Cardiff University Brain Research Imaging Centre (CUBRIC), has the ability to acquire EEG and FMRI data simultaneously which has allowed us to develop methods in this project for comparing the information in EEG with that from FMRI, helping us to identify the brain regions which are likely to have an influence on the EEG signal. We have developed an improved method for extracting features from the EEG data in an experiment examining the human brain's response to painful laser stimulation in healthy volunteers. Our method identifies a stronger relationship between the EEG data and the perceived level of pain and between the EEG data and the FMRI data, enabling an enhanced interpretation of the information in the EEG. We have been able to demonstrate the reduction of pain-related brain activity with the application of a powerful intravenous anaesthetic. We have also conducted a further experiment in which different types of stimulation were presented to volunteers in order to broaden our methods beyond studying pain. This included looking at visual, auditory and sensory (touch) function. These were further modulated by the application of a sedative drug. These new data and our examination of pharmacological analgesia (manuscripts in preparation) highlight the usefulness of joint EEG-FMRI analysis, and therefore enhanced EEG information. Our methods should therefore be useful in future in evaluating the effect of novel drugs in the brain.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>As well as being of use in the long term in the healthcare setting for disease evaluation the tools studied could improve the assessment of novel drugs under development in the pharmaceutical industry. This evaluation of neurovascular function could offer markers of brain penetration and early signals of efficacy which are needed to reduce the high cost of drug development by reducing the failure rate of compounds in clinical trials. The joint modeling of EEG-FMRI responses can be put to use in academic research aiming to study neurovascular coupling and joint modulation of electrophysiological and haemodynamic responses of the brain. This could be useful in neurological and psychiatric diseases.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>21B0A311-098E-40C9-AB18-66FB64498219</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-8073258780.0112167771c7aa</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.cubric.cf.ac.uk</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4DED77D1-6B36-42C9-94EA-D817D8444CF2</gtr:id><gtr:title>Taking into account latency, amplitude, and morphology: improved estimation of single-trial ERPs by wavelet filtering and multiple linear regression.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of neurophysiology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/0633dfa2d56ecf3c67ec8c238d9cdb36"><gtr:id>0633dfa2d56ecf3c67ec8c238d9cdb36</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hu L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0022-3077</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>sxLowBLZ81J</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/I01487X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6723A70B-A523-40AB-9740-B6AD2A0677B7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medical &amp; health interface</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FB535BD0-E265-4C0A-8532-32DCB83A3951</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>75</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tools, technologies &amp; methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EFFEC6B1-6BC8-4C9D-9D77-02CEF5E4E301</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biomedical neuroscience</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A759BB04-AFFE-4780-BD31-9A2707BC44BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>75</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medical Imaging</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
