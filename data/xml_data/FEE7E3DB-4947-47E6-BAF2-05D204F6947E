Agricultural soils in Great Britain are subject to a range of pressures which lead to changes in their properties over time that can (despite farmers' best efforts) exacerbate degradation threats such as erosion (loss of the soil resource), compaction and nutrient losses to freshwater. Agricultural soils must also have sufficient nutrients in available forms to ensure they can maintain large crop yields to feed an increasing population. It is therefore essential that we carefully monitor (over time) key properties of British soils to ensure they can continue to function effectively and also that these properties of the soil resource mean it is less likely to be degraded. These key properties include the organic matter content of the soil, the available quantity of two key nutrients for plant growth (phosphorus and potassium) and soil pH (its level of acidity - important in determining nutrient availability and plant growth in general). Government administrations across Great Britain (Defra, Welsh and Scottish Governments) have funded national-scale research to monitor the properties of agricultural topsoil since 1971 and various data have been analysed statistically to report on changes and trends of key soil indicators up to 2007. With declining research budgets, government departments are considering alternative, cost-effective ways to monitor these indicators and one approach is to utilise the soil measurements which farmers pay for, undertaken by commercial laboratories. Although there are many more of these farmer-initiated measurements in comparison to those undertaken using government research funds, the former are not collected to a statistical design and so need to be analysed in a different way to the latter. The farmer-initiated soil measurements may not be representative of soils more generally which could lead to different (biased) results in comparison with the measurements led by government-funded researchers. The aim of our project is to undertake comparisons between the data from farmer-initiated soil measurements and research led measurements to determine the size of any differences in the average values of the key indicators at regional and national scale. We will use statistical procedures which mean we can make consistent comparisons between the two types of data. If the differences we observe are small, it may be possible to use the farmer initiated surveys to monitor soil properties, thereby avoiding the costs of future national-scale, government funded surveys. Rather than approaching individual farmers, we have secured permission to use those data generated by the largest commercial agricultural soil laboratory in Great Britain. We will compare the values of key soil indicators from farmers' data and government-funded research data for the two main agricultural land use types (arable production and grassland) over the last ten years. We will work with, and present our findings to, those in government which have responsibility for soil policy at national scales.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>30348</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The Agricultural Industries Commission (AIC) have expressed a desire that their members contribute to the improved capture of these farmers' data through the use of the mYsoil app and this will be explored through discussions with the AIC.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2017</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>69AD2F33-F56D-4F7C-B493-F9AED58E15A4</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>58c6a14094a5d4.00030657</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>I showed that there are sufficient data available from soil analyses paid for by farmers to use these data to contribute to monitoring of soil indicators (such as pH and nutrient concentrations) across England and Wales (national scale). The benefit of this approach is that there are so many of these data they can also highlight problems related to soil properties at regional scale. For example, I showed that soil pH across large parts of north-west England and Wales have fallen below the value (5.5) at which yields on grassland may start to decline. The larger number of sites at which we have data means we can make maps of these properties at finer scales than have been possible with government funded surveys, and for very little extra cost. I showed that differences in the method of analyses for soil phosphorus account for the differences we observe between different surveys, including the farmers' data we used in our study. I also showed that the patterns in the soil indicator values of the farmers' data are similar to those from statistically designed surveys.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The Soils Policy team at Defra are currently considering the approaches they wish to deploy for soil monitoring across England and my research has contributed to the policy options under consideration. My study has been referred to in the Ministerial briefing note that outlines the various options available. Another NERC funded study under the Soil Security programme (in which I am involved) has been investigating ways to automate the capture of farmers' data by analytical laboratories and agronomists using the mYsoil app.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D64E5DA3-B25B-4BC4-9299-80CB6753C988</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c69fb6353083.44522085</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.bgs.ac.uk/research/climateChange/sustainableSoils/caasm.html</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Research used in ministerial briefing on soil monitoring</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>42A26B6A-1344-4516-84E2-5E518995B4A0</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5877b1058c51d4.12770296</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>I added georeferences (coordinates) to a farmers database so that the data could be analysed spatially for my own research and could be used in other research.</gtr:description><gtr:id>D70FDE34-E2B2-46DA-9981-8B35585D41BF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The database will be used in the NERC cross centre ASSIST project which examines relationships between crop yield and soil properties at national scale.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6a2d970e788.58256897</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Georeferenced soil indicator data for the British Isles (2004-2015)</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2017</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1CF55026-8C82-44EE-B112-59F7FBFBF28A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Are data collected to support farm management suitable for monitoring soil indicators at the national scale?</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>European Journal of Soil Science</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/744eec8957cd0060cf5640f9c1710da9"><gtr:id>744eec8957cd0060cf5640f9c1710da9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rawlins B</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58be83878f3831.26051231</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/N012380/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5B25B6A3-B218-4F11-8A9D-661236DF455C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>80</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agri-environmental science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>825466D8-66F3-4ABB-A62C-357225C4B154</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Terrest. &amp; freshwater environ.</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>794345CD-A1D5-4984-ADDD-088BCF41822F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agricultural systems</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>62DCC1BF-B512-4BDB-A0C3-02BC17E15F6B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biogeochemical Cycles</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4237918D-61A8-47E0-91EE-65E98661A88B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Earth &amp; environmental</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12C7A68B-3922-4925-9C0B-7FACEC921815</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ecosystem Scale Processes</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>96F70ACB-D35F-416F-9360-4EFD402DFA6B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Soil science</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
