&lt;p>With over 1000 academic studies on achieving resilience, few translate this learning into what to do in practice. RT, which has been co-innovated by academics, practitioners and parents of children with complex needs, is a way of working with disadvantaged children and young people that offers a framework for helping them bounce back. RT involves both developing the resilience research base and offering its lessons to practitioners, parents and young people. It is a scholarly, popular and user-friendly method of achieving good outcomes and is designed for all to use including parent carers.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Through the use of pilot activities such as individual consultations, training, workshops, drama and mentorship, RT can bring about organisational change.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p>

&lt;p>Building resilience will: spread knowledge, set up activities, ensure RT works in the real world; help community and university partners to swap their expertise and to recognise the value of each others' contributions, create an RT training programme and website. &lt;/p>

The 'Resilience House' exhibition showcased the various RCUK resilience related projects with which the University of Brighton and boingboing have been involved. Within the 'Resilience House' there were various areas that corresponded to the 5 key areas of the resilience framework and within these we displayed videos, posters, resilience guides and other artistic outputs. Young people with complex needs and mental health difficulties co-curated the event and they explained the outputs to the visitors and were also involved in interactive aspects of the house such as making a 'Resilient tablecloth' and making a 'Resilience cake'.</gtr:description><gtr:id>88CF1B94-F69D-4B56-826D-930F1F0AE310</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The festival ran for 2 days and on the second day, the 'Resilience House' was viewed by 135 people (accurate visitor statistics for day one are not available). Visitors to the stand asked questions about the projects that we have been working on and were keen to learn more about how we work with the various community partners. We have received requests to exhibit the 'Resilience House' at other conferences and events in the UK. The young people who co-curated and participated in the event have reported being more confident and they have experienced improvements in their mental health. Boingboing has appointed one of the young people as an artist in residence and they have a Visiting Fellowship at the University of Brighton.

The S2T advocates a balanced approach and draws on an eclectic mix of traditional pathogenic and salutogenic theories. It aims at re-authoring trauma narratives in a safe healing group context, where there is reflection on individual strengths and capacities borne from the struggle to cope with childhood trauma. Such strengths-based interventions should be advocated through community engagement and policy development. One delegate was from Australia. The presentation was followed by a Q&amp;amp;A.

[Seminar presentation] 40th College of Occupational Therapists Annual Conference, Harrogate 28th -30th June 2016.

This presentation reports on the design, implementation and evaluation of a co-created resilience building course for adults with mental health problems. This innovative service development is also one site of a wider multi-national UK research council funded project which aims to explore the potential for community university partnerships to make better and more resilient collective futures. The course comprised 8 weekly sessions developed by a partnership of peer trainers and occupational therapists (practitioners and an academic). Peer trainers are people with lived experience of mental health problems who have been recruited and trained as tutors by a Recovery College in England. Recovery Colleges are a growing initiative involving a partnership of the health service providers and service user organisations underpinned by a collaborative recovery orientated philosophy using an educative approach (Perkins et al 2012). People who attend Recovery College courses are seen as 'learners' not, for instance, as service users, clients or carers.

The course content drew on an adapted version of the Resilience Framework (Hart et al 2007) and a range of other resilience tools and models alongside the personal, practice and research expertise of the facilitators. It aimed to increase learners' resilience to respond on an individual and collective basis to the adversities they faced using internal and external resources and supports. This was achieved by combining lived experience expertise of mental health recovery and occupational approaches. The impact of the course was evaluated using qualitative data (eg interviews, course notes and products) and quantitative data (eg resilience scales). Findings suggest that Peer Trainers and Occupational Therapists (academics and practitioners in this educative practice model) have compatible knowledge, skills and experience that enable them to collaborate in Recovery College courses and effectively support resilience building.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b04eb88049f4.05095488</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Patients, carers and/or patient groups</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://blogs.brighton.ac.uk/healthsciences/2016/07/16/resilience-workshop-occupational-therapy/#more-363</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Children in Care session</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6897FDB4-6B1C-4F90-8518-F534E7F92174</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Participants were very engaged in the discussion and drew on their own practice to consider integration with resilient ways of working

[Oral presentation] Annual Festival of Social Sciences, University of Brighton, 19th May 2016.

This presentation reports on emerging research findings of a co-created resilience building course for adults with mental health problems. This project is one site of a wider multi-national UK research council funded Imagine: Social Context project (http://www.imaginecommunity.org.uk/projects/the-social-context/) which explores the potential for community university partnerships to make better and more resilient collective futures. The course was developed by a partnership of peer trainers, practitioners and an academic. Peer trainers are people with lived experience of mental health problems trained as tutors by a Recovery College. Recovery Colleges are a growing initiative involving partnerships of health service providers and service user organisations underpinned by a collaborative recovery orientated philosophy using an educative approach (Perkins et al 2012). 

The course drew on an adapted version of the Resilience Framework (Hart et al 2007) and a range of other resilience tools and models alongside the personal, practice and research expertise of the facilitators. It aimed to increase learners' resilience to respond on an individual and collective basis to the adversities they faced using internal and external resources and supports. This was achieved by combining lived experience expertise of mental health recovery and evidence-based practice approaches. The impact of the course was evaluated using qualitative data (eg interviews, course notes and products) and quantitative data (eg resilience scales). Emerging findings suggest this collaborative educative approach can effectively support resilience building. Secondly, contray to some individualising and responsibilising resilience discourses, powerful evidence emerged that participants identified with and valued the underpinning ecological model of resilience.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b04f5f5492b3.33961460</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Mindmate Resilience Conference Leeds Keynote</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>ECD19EBE-FBFC-4963-872F-493E1923B18D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Boing Boing were commissioned to co-ordinate the delivery of a local conference in Leeds, to provide local practitioners with enhanced knowledge, skills and understanding of how to promote resilience in practice.

The forum was lead by members of the Blackpool HeadStart team (HeadStart is a &amp;pound;75m programme funded by the Big Lottery Fund to build the emotional resilience of young people aged 10-16). The Blackpool HeadStart Partnership shared their resilience model which helps explore potential resources available for young people to build their resilience individually, within their family, school and community. This new and innovative approach to applying resilience theory in practice is highly thought provoking and begins with the question 'What can we change together, so children and young people can flourish and belong?' 25 people attended the forum including a couple of people from Public Health England, who are developing a position statement on Adolescent Resilience to support local authorities to implement their approaches . There were also YoungMinds staff, someone from the Department of Health, a smattering of freelance consultants and NHS doctors and some young people on work experience at YoungMinds from various other London-based charities making up the 25 strong audience.

The event was commissioned by the ESRC to complement an expert reference group report (December 2015) and other consultations. The not-for-profit Boingboing conducted the 'Have Your Say' consultation in collaboration with the University of Brighton.

This innovative service development is also one site of a wider multi-national UK research council funded project which aims to explore the potential for community university partnerships to make better and more resilient collective futures. The course comprised 8 weekly sessions developed by a partnership of peer trainers and occupational therapists (practitioners and an academic). Peer trainers are people with lived experience of mental health problems who have been recruited and trained as tutors by a Recovery College in England. Recovery Colleges are a growing initiative involving a partnership of the health service providers and service user organisations underpinned by a collaborative recovery orientated philosophy using an educative approach (Perkins et al 2012). People who attend Recovery College courses are seen as 'learners' not, for instance, as service users, clients or carers.

The course content drew on an adapted version of the Resilience Framework (Hart et al 2007) and a range of other resilience tools and models alongside the personal, practice and research expertise of the facilitators. It aimed to increase learners' resilience to respond on an individual and collective basis to the adversities they faced using internal and external resources and supports. This was achieved by combining lived experience expertise of mental health recovery and occupational approaches. The impact of the course was evaluated using qualitative data (eg interviews, course notes and products) and quantitative data (eg resilience scales). Findings suggest that Peer Trainers and Occupational Therapists (academics and practitioners in this educative practice model) have compatible knowledge, skills and experience that enable them to collaborate in Recovery College courses and effectively support resilience building.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b051bf93a4c9.98318425</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Patients, carers and/or patient groups</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.sussexrecoverycollege.org.uk/courses/brighton-and-hove-campus/1-courses/115-resilience</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015,2016,2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Health Visitor Training</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9EF0C9B7-627D-433E-BCC0-5AEC4DBE2F0A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Health Visitors engaged in conversation and exercises to learn about resilience

Drawing on their own experiences in co-productive research, as well as the experiences of those attending the session, they discussed ways in which individuals and communities can be supported to make 'resilient moves' aimed at transforming not just individuals but also the communities, organisations and environments in which we all live and work.

It ensures that there is no break for students between school and work, so that students do not become unemployed at any point, and are transitioned into the identity of a working person. Students are based in the workplace and as well as learning English and Maths they learn employability skills and go on work placements every day to prepare them for a real paid job. It has tremendous success rates and is something that is growing in popularity in the UK and Europe. Delegates were particularly interested in whether more programmes could be initiated in the UK and how, and staff from a different Project SEARCH were also in the audience and able to contribute during the Q&amp;amp;A.

Consistent positive feedback from front-line practitioners and parent carers indicates that their day-to-day work has been directly influenced by the provision of opportunities to learn about resilience theory and the RT approach. Evaluations demonstrate RT has increased their confidence and feelings of effectiveness. Collaborative relationships between university and community partners are being sustained through social enterprise activities coordinated by a new Community Interest Company and a dedicated website www.boingboing.org.uk, has increased access to resilience based information and resources. National policy teams, senior civil servants and ministers, a leading national charity, community organisations, local authorities, academics, front line staff and parent carers have increased their understanding of resilience and Resilient Therapy, integrating the learning into their respective policy, teaching, research, workplace and home based settings. The mental health and skills (in training, writing and policy work) of young people with complex health difficulties has been enhanced and an RT toolkit for parents made available for free download. Statutory and third sector agencies have embedded RT in their organisations, with staff teams reporting the benefits of a 'shared language' and strengths based strategic approach in their work with children and families. RT is more securely rooted in the School of Nursing and Midwifery and related teaching curricula. Students report favourably on the inclusion of resilience concepts in their mentoring workshops and provide enthusiastic feedback about the positive benefits to community practitioners and parents teaching on university courses.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>1.

We took the resilience research evidence base and put it together with other sets of ideas gleaned from our practice with very disadvantaged children and families in an NHS Child and Adolescent Mental Health Clinic. Alongside this, Angie's adoptive parenting knowledge went into the mix and, we've collected experiences from those we are working with in our RT Communities of Practice.

We distilled all these different sets of ideas into a handy RT table that summarises our approach and acts as a reminder to people of what's included. Practitioners and parents use the table to plan strategic moves with children. We've also been developing a version of the table for use with adults, and this is where we've got to so far with that, which is still work in progress, the Resilience Framework for adults.

Our Aims and Objectives

To actively promote an appreciation and understanding of resilience research and practice for the benefit of supporting children, young people, families and adults exposed to social disadvantage.

So, how do we do this?

By working in collaboration with university, third sector and statutory partners plus parents, young people and service users, we plan to:

- Establish a virtuous learning cycle between research, education and practice
- Work with individuals to weave resilience-based practice into their daily practice
- Deliver training on the resilience research evidence base and practical approaches to resilience building
- Produce resilience learning and practice resources
