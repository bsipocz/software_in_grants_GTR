For many offenders, criminal punishments are not experienced in isolation, but rather are given meaning in the context of wider lives and previous penal experiences. This is especially the case for persistent offenders, who generally have long punishment careers.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This research explores how they interpret the accumulation of sentences in their lives. Around 35 men and women in Scotland who have been repeatedly sentenced over at least 15 years will be interviewed, using life history methods. If they agree, a year later they will be interviewed again to see how their interpretations and views have changed over this time. This is intended both to examine how views are influenced by being incarcerated, and by other turning points in people's lives (eg finding employment, becoming a parent). The second stage of the research is expected to result in around 15 interviews, for a total of around 50 interviews.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In addition to the academic audiences outlined above, the research is likely to be of interest to three separate non-academic groups, as well as the general public interested in issues of crime and punishment.

First of all, the findings should be of interest to criminal justice policy makers. The Scottish Government is currently running phase 2 of its Reducing Reoffending Programme (RRP2) and is especially interested in changing the trajectory of persistent low-tariff offenders, not least because of the exceptionally high costs of reoffending in this population. They are therefore currently seeking to develop reforms in the reintegration of short-term prisoners (who receive no statutory supervision). However, knowledge of how people who have experienced multiple short prison sentences experience these and give them meaning (or see them as meaningless) and what aspects of the content of sentences and/or efforts at reintegration are experienced as helpful is very limited, despite being essential to the development of criminal justice policy in these areas.

Secondly, the findings of the proposed research are likely to have practice implications for professionals in the criminal justice system. This includes sentencers, criminal justice social workers and prison personnel, as well as the Scottish Prison Service. A greater understanding of how sentences are seen and what assists and what detracts from intentions of 'going straight', both within the criminal justice system and in offenders' wider lives, should enable improved engagement with offenders and their desistance process for all of these groups.

Thirdly, the research may be of interest to those who have been through the criminal justice system, in order to see how their experiences are (dis)similar to those of others. It has been highlighted again and again in the literature that prisoners tend to see their life-paths in individual terms, rather than recognising structural constraints. Presenting them with an account of different prisoners' lives and punishments might allow them to start to connect their lives with those of others.

Finally, the general public may be interested in the results and it may be beneficial to give them insight in the findings in order to better inform views of crime and punishment. However, this needs to be treated with caution, in order to avoid sensationalist interest, or breaches of confidentiality. The university will provide training in relation to press engagement in order to address these risks. Informed members of the public will have access to information about the research published as blog posts or articles available on the web. Other ways to disseminate findings to the public more directly will have to be explored in the course of the research, with help from the reference group that will be set up in the early stages.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>122472</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>(Re)turning point: Confinement, Coping and Change</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>80552AC0-9782-49CB-959B-209E733D9FAE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was a Knowledge Exchange event I organised and for which I invited other speakers: Dr Esther van Ginneken and Professor Shadd Maruna. The Scottish Prison Service part-funded it, and the event was to be chaired by its Chief Executive, Colin McConnell, who unfortunately was prevented from attending at the last moment. Over fifty representatives from the Scottish Prison Service, Criminal Justice Social Work, third sector organisations and universities attended. Notably, at least five SPS prison governors were in the audience. Out of the 21 people who responded to a feedback request, 58% rated the event as excellent, and 32% as very good. There was a lively discussion session after the presentations. The event was recorded, and there were several reactions from people who had watched it on-line after the event.

Connected with several community organisations, which were interested in collaborations in knowledge exchange and/or supporting the recruitment of participants in current research. Also, tighter ties with Scottish Prison Service representatives were forged, with several requests for information on the state of current research received afterwards.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-7356799791.8993232b4bf594</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.glasgowsociology.com/returning-point-confinement-coping-and-change/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Newsdrive radio interview</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3F897F0E-6152-4AA9-A2BB-7EDF200D230C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Brief interview about the research on current affairs programme

Afterwards several people came up to me to discuss how things could be different and to discuss their personal experiences of knowing people in prison. With a public engagement aim of challenging the public's understanding of who is in prison, I felt this event was a success.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>57f75adf3e98d2.20360417</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.explorathon.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Talk-schedule-.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Barlinnie seminar</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6FFE2544-E2EF-4F4A-AE17-B3BC4BD4E1CA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I gave a seminar at Barlinnie prison to inform their Programme Development - an overhaul of how Barlinnie prison does things, changing towards a person-based approach.
