Traditional methods which are predominantly paper driven are expensive, cumbersome, and although well intended have become an overburdened, legislative bureaucracy that doesn?t work effectively.

The continuous drive and requirement to manage better, record more, improve services and reduce costs has to be sustainable, cost effective and efficient. Service providers in healthcare in particular are experiencing almost impossible pressures to maintain and improve services on minimum resources and finances.

Most organisations recognise they have to do something and that to change from these traditional systems has its problems in cost, training, management and requires the ability and the will to accept change.

The Solution

Audit Check is a paperless auditing and inspection tool that utilises smart phones and tablets. It?s designed to digitalise around 95% of an organisations manual paper checks as well as being user friendly, easy to implement and manage and to make the least skilled operative into the industry expert. Above all it will save time and money in all organisations.

The app is chargeable by user but free to download to unlimited devices. The app is then uniquely accessed by the operator via their unique data login of username and password.

The user first digitalises their existing paper forms in the simple to use web based management software. They can also easily add new or amend existing questions and audits. The benefit here is that the new digitalised forms match their existing paperwork and users require very minimal training to use the app. In the app they just select sync and the users audits can be selected from their list. Once the checks are completed sync again and they are instantly transferred to the web management solution. With the proposed report writer module they will be able to extract far more data and produce
reports themselves to suit their specific requirements such as Care Quality Commission and the Health and Safety executive and with the Works Order module they will be able to continue the paperless process by directly raising remedial works from the synced completed checks reporting issues.

With the new proposed app development the app will be available on more android devices (which can now be purchased for under &amp;pound;100 each) thus making our solution more cost effective to users, and therefore more desirable, as they will be able to bring their own devices benefiting from mixed platforms.&amp;quot;</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>5000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">753105</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
