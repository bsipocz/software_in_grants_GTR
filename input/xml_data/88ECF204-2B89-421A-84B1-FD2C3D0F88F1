Studentships are available in a variety of projects across 7 Schools and 2 interdisciplinary Research Institutes and offer students the opportunity to benefit from an excellent local research environment as well as a comprehensive programme of research and professional skills development from the University Graduate College.
PhD projects are available across a range of topics that align with Cardiff's research strengths &amp;amp; EPSRC's priorities. Projects will be rooted in an academic school but may work at the interfaces with other disciplines, be connected to an interdisciplinary Research Institute, &amp;amp; involve collaborations with other scientific researchers, industrial partners and other organisations.
Specific projects will vary by year; they will be available in the following areas:
Engineering: Environment and Sustainability; Mechanics, Materials &amp;amp; Advanced
Manufacturing; Energy; and Health, Technology &amp;amp; the Digital World.
Chemistry: Biological Chemistry; Catalysis &amp;amp; Interfacial Science; Materials &amp;amp; Energy;
Molecular Synthesis; Spectroscopy &amp;amp; Dynamics.
Physics and Astronomy: Photonics &amp;amp; Biophotonics (with colleagues in Biosciences);
Quantum Materials &amp;amp; Devices; Nanoscale Science &amp;amp; Technology; Theory &amp;amp;
Computational Physics; an Imaging, Sensors &amp;amp; Instrumentation.
Computer Science and Informatics: Distributed &amp;amp; Scientific Computing; Informatics;
and Visual Computing
Mathematics: Mathematical Analysis; Applied &amp;amp; Computational Mathematics;
Geometry, Algebra, Mathematical Physics &amp;amp; Topology; Operational Research; and 
statistics.
Cardiff University Brain Research Imaging Centre (CUBRIC): which brings together
world-leading expertise in brain mapping with the very latest in brain imaging and
brain stimulation, and connects biomedical researchers with engineers, physicists,
mathematicians and computer scientists.
Data Innovation Research Institute: launched in 2015, the Institute researches
aspects of managing, analysing and interpreting massive volumes of textual and
numerical information.
Energy Systems Research Institute: launched in 2015, the Institute researches
sustainable, affordable, socially acceptable and secure energy systems, to tackle
global challenges in how we generate, distribute and utilise energy.
Common to all studentships in the Cardiff University EPSRC DTP is our objective to train the
next generation of research leaders, innovators and entrepreneurs in the physical sciences
and engineering, by:
equipping students with advanced research skills, supported by expert supervision, a
well-funded infrastructure and dynamic research culture
supporting them to communicate their research through seminars, external
conferences and networking
fostering interdisciplinary research through groupings of engineering, physical,
chemical, biological, medical and social scientists
offering a comprehensive programme of professional and career development
opportunities (www.cardiff.ac.uk/ugcp)
hosting cohort activities that encourage interactions of doctoral students across disciplines
engendering a commitment to research excellence and impact, and explorations of new ways of thinking.
Research at Cardiff is supported by excellent facilities that range from environmental characterisation labs, performance engineering, biotechnology services, high performance computing &amp;amp; brain imaging through to gas turbine combustors, rigs, and lightning laboratories.
