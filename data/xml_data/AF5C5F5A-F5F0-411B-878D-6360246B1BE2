Collaboration</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/N00597X/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Most of the foods that we eat rely on insects for pollination. The populations of the honeybee and wild pollinators have rapidly declined due to habitat change, global warming and disease. There is a burden of responsibility for researchers and public bodies to explore ways to halt this decline. To date, most of the response to this challenge has been led by natural and social/economic scientists and although the arts community has worked on awareness raising projects there has been little collaboration. Responding to this observation, this network will bring together arts researchers with natural and social scientists, beneficiaries and policy makers to 
explore the role that the arts can play in increasing understanding of the causes of the decline in pollinator populations and influence policy decisions to help halt this decline.

By bringing the network members together the 'Cross-pollination' project will: 
- help scientists produce better understandings of pollinator decline; 
- explore new collaborative ways of working where the perspectives of the 'arts' and 'sciences' enrich each other; 
- help change the perceived value of pollinators; 
- and effectively influence decision-making.

Drawing on existing networks, Liggins (PI) and Christie (Co-I) will bring together key researchers, artists and stakeholders to participate in a series of exploratory arts workshops that will explore theories of aesthetics, sensory perception, differences in perspectives and language, and investigate possible creative interactions and partnerships. From these meetings a series of speculative art interventions will be set up to produce art works and explore ideas arising from the collaborations. Using the methodology of the 'Art Crit', not normally used within the scientific community, Cross-pollination will enable researchers from various disciplines and stakeholders to interrogate the art process, to share reflections, and explore the range of value judgments. Throughout the process, artists will be partnered with scientists and decision makers with the expectation that a future research agenda will be developed. 

Confirmed participants include award winning scientists in the area of pollinator research from the UK and USA and high profile arts researchers from the fields of aesthetics, perception and community arts. An important addition are two linguists studying the language of environmental research and its affect on perceived values. The Co-I Christie's expertise in the Valuation of Nature for Ecosystem Service Sustainability, will provide a further focus for the project. PI Liggins has undertaken a number of science/art projects, most recently with the NBGW and is presently contributing to the NERC project Duress Theme 5 led by Co-I Christie to deliver research through arts practice, particularly looking at differences in perception of value.

A number of the representatives in policy making organisations are also involved, such as Pollinator Taskforce Wales, Intergovernmental Science -Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) Deliverable 3a Global Pollinator Assessment. Co-I Christie has led a number of research projects involved in the economic evaluation of nature and bio-diversity and was PI the NERC Valuing Nature Steering project. Further confirmed beneficiaries, who have been involved in the development of Cross-pollination include the BumbleBee Conservation Trust (Bee Wild project), BugLife, The Bee Garden at the National Botanic Garden of Wales (NBGW), Dr Beynon's Bug Farm, and the Heart of Wales Line and Arriva Trains Wales 120 Miles of Garden project. The NBGW, where some events will take place, is well-placed to disseminate many of the ideas and findings to the general public, as there is an established Bee Garden Visitors Centre, and there are already links with other National Gardens, such a Royal National Garden of Scotland and the Nanshan Botanic Gardens in China.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>From the outset organisations, policy makers and individuals who will benefit from the research findings will take part in the structured process of collaboration. The stakeholders listed below are confirmed network members and have been consulted in-depth on the development of Cross-pollination in order that the project maximises its potential impacts. 

On a national level the project has ensured that for example the Welsh Pollinator Taskforce are active through the process as two key participants are members. The range of key participants have been carefully planned to maximise the opportunities for more inclusion of artists and arts researchers policy-making boards.

On a global level confirmed network participant Potts (Reading University) is a key member of the Intergovernmental Science -Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) and Chair of the IPBIS Deliverable 3a Global Pollinator Assessment. This organisation acts as an interface between the scientific community and policymakers to build capacity for and strengthen the use of science in policy making and address gaps in the science-policy interface on biodiversity and ecosystem services. This organisation is currently looking at the socio-cultural, indigenous and other values associated with pollinators and pollination, and Cross-pollination will directly contribute to the assessment and via IPBES to policy making globally. The U.S.A. for example last year launched a Pollinator Health Task Force, after seeing a 23% reduction in bee populations, therefor it is important that this project involves international participants (Graystock), to internationalise the range of impacts, and ensure a more international representation.

Co-I Christie has been PI on a number of NERC and Defra funded projects for valuing ecosystem services for biodiversity, a contributor to the UK National Ecosystem Assessment (NEA), which in turn helped shape the UK Government's Natural Environment White Paper. He is at present lead investigator of the Valuation Theme of the DURESS project (Diversity in Upland Rivers for Ecosystem Service Sustainability), and through key participation in Cross-pollination will be able to network the findings through a broad range of policy-makers and develop new methodologies for both economic and non-economic environment valuation projects. 

Organisations who will ensure that any findings are incorporated into the public face of their enterprises are Dr Beynon's Bug farm and The Bee Garden at the NBGW, the Bee Wild Project (Bumblebee Conservation Trust) in West Wales, and the Heart of Wales Line and Arriva Trains Wales, 120 miles Station Gardens project. The former is a new centre opening in West Wales, the brainchild of the entomologist and TV presenter, Beynon, whose award winning research is in the field of beetles. At present the Farm is conducting field studies into farmland biodiversity, ecosystem services provided by wildlife particularly Lowland Heath (a priority habitat in the UK Biodiversity Action Plan), and the future of sustainable food production. Over the next few years a Public Tourist Centre is being developed at the site to enhance public awareness of the importance of insects for sustaining biodiversity. Beynon is a key participant and the art/science interactions of this project will have impact through this commercial enterprise. The Bee Garden at NBGW will display on-going findings of the project and the artworks. In addition the Garden holds training days and events for bee-keepers and Growing for Diversity.

In addition ongoing Blog and Social Media will commentate on the process of the project. This will be linked to the NBGW and to the UWTSD INSPIRE websites. The BBC One Show and BBC Spring-Watch have previously featured De Vere, Lucas and Beynon, and it is expected that this project will attract similar media coverage.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>36113</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Dr Beynon's Bug Farm</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Network Partnerships for the Production of Artworks (Dr Beynon's Bug Farm)</gtr:description><gtr:id>D77DFAF3-4956-4334-B2D2-C13E9856EFD5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None as yet.

Art/Science collaborative projects include - 
Project 10: 'When Less Is More'
Artists - Prof Karen Ingham, supporting artist Ben Sharpe
 Scientists - Prof Mike Christie from Aberystwyth University; Dr Sarah Beynon from Dr Beynon's Bug Farm; Dr Sophie Bennet from Aberystwyth University; Sinead Lynch from Bumblebee Conservation Trust; and Prof Simon Potts and the team at Reading University
When Less Is More will be a film (a dual-screen diptych) installation with accompanying photographic images. The film will use an arts based 'practice-led research' methodology to explore the public's understanding of, conceptualisation of, and willingness to accept, behavioural change in relation to how we value nature, specifically pollinating insects and their habitats. 
From an arts perspective the film is a development of Ingham's previous research into pollinators and their habitats as examined in the globally disseminated multidisciplinary art and science project 'Pollinator Frocks'. From the science perspective, the underpinning research for the film is based on Professor Michael Christie's (Aberystwyth University) and Dr Sarah Beynon's (University of Oxford and Dr Beynon's Bug Farm) research into environmental, economic and social valuations of biodiversity and ecosystems. The film will illustrate the importance of flower-rich habitat in supporting biodiversity, most specifically insect pollinators. Dr Beynon's Bug Farm (St Davids, Pembrokeshire) provides the location for the film. 
The film will question how two different agricultural habitats (a species rich, wildflower meadow and an equivalent area of intensively managed, 
monoculture (single-species) grassland (see photographs above))attract, interact with, and sustain insect pollinators. The areas in question are relatively small, about the size of a domestic front garden, with the intention of prompting the viewer to make the connection between the wider issues surrounding sustainable grassland farming practices in relation to domestic gardening practice. For example, the intensively mown, weed-free, pristine green lawn is in effect a 'green death' for pollinators and is the equivalent of the intensively managed, species poor parcel of land. The sense of transition, time passing and seasonal interactions will be achieved by using time-lapse images interwoven with a series of dissolves punctuated by static moments of quiet observation, where, for example, the sound plays an important role. The wildflower meadow is alive with buzzing and birdsong while the intensive grassland is comparatively silent. The film will also use infrared night filming to observe how nocturnal pollinators, such as moths, interact with the habitats.

The film aims to influence public perception on this very topical issue and thus inform future policy decisions by showcasing the importance and beauty of wildflower meadows in comparison to the current trend for monocultures of rye grass in both agricultural and domestic arenas (field and lawn). 
The film will be shown as a permanent exhibit at Dr Beynon's Bug Farm visitor attraction (www.thebugfarm.co.uk). On-site interpretation will explain how to create your own mini-meadows in your own garden, bursting with colour and wildlife. The film will also link to the Bug Farm Trail, where visitors can wander through the award-winning wildflower meadows at the farm seeing first-hand just how important they are for wildlife as well as for producing feed for grazing livestock.

Project 11: Multi-Sensory Pollinator Trail
Artists - Sarah Tombs; Dan Trivedy; 
Supporting artists - Martina Morgan; Pauline Beynon; Ben Sharpe, Sarah Johnson; Andy Holcroft
Scientists - Dr Sarah Beynon from Dr Beynon's Bug Farm
The Bug Farm Pollinator Trail will encourage members of the public visiting The Bug Farm to explore the Bug Farm Trail using the senses of an insect pollinator moving from one piece of artwork to another and seeing the world from a pollinator's-eye-view. 
 
Site of the Pollinator Trail at The Bug Farm
Participants will take a multi-sensory journey across the farmed landscape to explore it in a totally novel and unique way, hopefully understand that a more complex landscape with more flowers (alongside productive agriculture) = better for pollinators. Moving through wildflower meadows managed for pollinators, passing bee hives, solitary bee nests, bumblebee nests and hoverfly nests, this truly immersive journey leads people into the hidden world of life in the undergrowth.
 
Artists and scientists based at The Bug Farm will link pieces of artwork together as a fun, yet educational, journey using a treasure-hunt/geo-caching format with clues provided at each artwork to guide the participant towards the next artwork. Clues will require participants to explore the artworks using one 'sense' per piece. Any senses not explored on the journey will be described on Bug Farm interpretation across the Trail. Stations (pieces of artwork) situated across the &amp;frac14; mile route will each be based upon one of the following artworks:
1. Hearing: An old grain silo, shaped like a honeybee hive (or even a cocoon) on the site will be used as a giant auditorium to play insect sounds, giving an audio clue to find the next artwork on the Trail*. 
2. Sight: 
a. Participants will wear bug goggles to enable them to see with compound eyes, visually showing the way to the next piece of art
b. 3D goggles will bring the micro-sculpture of giant flower sculptures alive and only one flower will offer up a clue within its micro-sculpture
c. UV torches will allow people to see how a bee sees UV landing strips on giant flower sculptures, guiding them to the next piece of art 
d. A large painting by Pauline Beynon will showcase a pollinator-eye-view of life in a hedgerow showing the importance of habitat corridors across farmland
3. Smell: Here we explore how insect pollinators use pheromones to communicate with each other, impregnating specific scents into fabric 'flowers' across the Trail, with only one scent leading in the correct direction
4. Touch: A sculpture of a flower with specific micro-sculpture to attract pollinators. Only one micro-sculpture pattern leads people in the correct direction
5. Dance: A waggle-dance routine will be choreographed leading to the next artwork
The Pollinator Trail at The Bug Farm will be a permanent exhibit at The Bug Farm, complete with large sculptures and photographs of the diverse range of different pollinating insects to meet, and learn about, along the way. The project will reach thousands of public visitors, school groups, farmers/farm groups, scientists and policy makers per year. It will be linked with other interpretation at the site showcasing how we can produce food and farm efficiently yet looking after wildlife at the same time. It will also link with shop merchandising (e.g. wildflower seed packs will be for sale). Dr Sarah Beynon also works as a television presenter, so there is potential for additional media reach for this Project.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Bristol</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Queen's School of Engineering</gtr:department><gtr:description>Network Partnerships for the Production of Artworks (The Bee Lab)</gtr:description><gtr:id>63E0DFFB-1183-4CF3-A055-48DA875497A4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>No outputs as yet

After the Introductory Network Event four artists/arts researchers visited the Bee Lab at Bristol University to discuss further the possible collaborative artworks.
Four individual artwork projects are in production see below -

Project 2: Petal surfaces
Artist - Sarah Tombs 
Scientists - Dr Heather Whitney and Mike Harrap, Bristol Bee Lab, Bristol University
Bristol University Bee Lab investigates multi modal 'cues' that pollinators use to find flowers to collect nectar. This involves casting petals to look at the way the surfaces enable beneficial pollinators and act as deterrents for other insects. They have discovered that there are differing petal surfaces on one petal and Tombs will looking at the petal form and its complex surfaces to create wax petals, which will be cast into glass.
Project 4: Shimmer Wall
Artist - Daniel Trivedy 
Scientists - Dr Heather Whitney and Mike Harrap, Bristol Bee Lab, Bristol University
This work is inspired by the research conducted at The Bee Lab in the University of Bristol. Following a visit to the Bee Lab Trivedy was particularly interested in their work on structural iridescence and the role it played in pollination. Essentially, flowers were using iridescence as a way of 'advertising' themselves and attracting pollinators. 
As part of the research process, the team at the Bee Lab made small iridescent discs that were created by making casts of petals using epoxy resin (see images below).
Sticking to the theme of using iridescence as a method of advertising, it is my intention to create a 'Shimmer Wall' created out of epoxy resin discs. 
Project 5: Signals
Artist - Shelley Doolan
Scientists - Dr Heather Whitney and Mike Harrap, Bristol Bee Lab, Bristol University
As part of the Cross-pollination project, Doolan will be working with colleagues at the 'Bee Lab' within Bristol University. The project will draw upon research into multi-modal 'signals' produced by plants to attract pollinators. Specifically she will create a series of tactile glass artefacts that explore and reveal the hidden structures of plant textures. The work will make use of images gathered by scanning electron microscopy in conjunction with lost-wax glass casting.
Doolan will investigate themes of structural colour such as iridescence as well the use of different textures to allow pollinators to have a secure 'footing' and - the darker side of pollination - those that cause the pollinator to slide into the carnivorous plant.
There will be a strong emphasis on the tactility of the surfaces, with the intention to draw in the 'viewer' through the interplay of light, colour, transparency, texture and pattern, to reveal and suggest a hidden world of micro-structure that forms the landscape for pollinator and plant. 
Project 9: Phenomenology of Colour
Artist - Dr Catrin Webster
Scientists - Dr Heather Whitney (Bristol University) and Dr Natasha De Vere (NBGW)
Paintings ability to evoke and stimulate the senses has been a fundamental aspect of my work for the past 20 years, which is centred on perception of place. Webster has explored how painting and sound can be correlated in projects such as 1000 Colours Blue, (2012) and is interested in the tension between the phenomenology of experience and the potential of painting to translate and communicate this. 
The opportunity to work with scientists and artist from a variety of disciplines around the theme of 'pollinator's has enabled Webster to gain a rich understanding of an alternative but interrelated sensory world. One key idea stimulated from these dialogues and insights has been to think about colour as iridescent (refracted light) rather than as purely reflective (paint). Webster wishes to experiment with creating textured surfaces, on metal for example, to make reflected light as iridescent colour together with using paint - as a means to explore and alternative perception of place. In addition, the opportunity to extend this research into a multisensory installation in the Botanical Gardens is a very exciting prospect, where sent, sound, surface and colour could all be utilised to create an experience which can be appreciated by a wide audience, including those who are visually or physically impaired.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>National Botanic Garden of Wales</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Network Partnerships for the Production of Artworks (National Botanic Garden of Wales)</gtr:description><gtr:id>2EE23130-327E-4F60-A557-61C92A7B73C5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>No outcomes as yet.

Fourteen art/science artwork production projects have arisen from the Introductory Network Events and subsequent visits and meetings (in person and Skype). The artistic outputs from these collaborations will be exhibited at the National Botanic Garden of Wales, both in the gallery and throughout the garden space.The exhibition has been arranged for the whole of July and August 2017. To ensure the partnerships operate to their fullest potential, the research team (artists) have visited the scientists and or held meetings with Skype. Also engagement with the other end users (stakeholders), the Bumblebee Conservation Trust, Dr Beynon's Bug Farm and Chair of the Heart of Wales Line (Arriva Trains) Development Committee has taken place, through meetings and shared project development. Below are descriptions of the projects (3/14) underway that directly involve the NBGW in their production. 
Project 3: Butterfly Wings
Artist - Jax Robinson
Scientists - Dr Heather Whitney and Mike Harrap, Bristol Bee Lab, Bristol University; Dr Natasha de Vere, National Botanic Garden of Wales
Looking at wing structures in wax and glass. Glass wings would be suspended in the Glass House at the National Botanic Garden of Wales. 
Project 6: Hoverflies - bio-mimicry masquerading
Artist - Professor Karen Ingham; 
Scientists - Dr Natasha De Vere (NBGW) and Andrew Lucas
The projects will focus on the important role of Hoverflies as 'promiscuous pollinators' i.e. pollinators of a wide range of plants. Hoverflies are sometimes referred to as 'the forgotten pollinators' in that they don't have the same appeal of the bee and the butterfly and most people confuse hoverflies with wasps as they often mimic the same pattern and colour coding. It is the hoverfly's ability to look like another creature entirely, its 'bio-mimicry masquerading' that fascinates Ingham and that she would like to explore. The project allows Ingham to follow on from the widely disseminated 'Pollinator Frocks'
http://kareningham.org.uk/portfolio/science-art-technology/pollinator-frocks and use a textiles based approach to create a design or designs that play on the remarkable skill of the hoverfly in mimicking so many other pollinating insects. Ingham is also interested in using the bioinformatics data that Natasha De Vere and Andrew Lucas have generated with their research, which graphically demonstrates the breadth and importance of the hoverflies pollination habitat. Ingham would like to explore incorporating this into a design that the Gardens would then use as part of their public engagement activities.
Project 9: Phenomenology of Colour
Artist - Dr Catrin Webster
Scientists - Dr Heather Whitney (Bristol University) and Dr Natasha De Vere (NBGW)
Paintings ability to evoke and stimulate the senses has been a fundamental aspect of my work for the past 20 years, which is centred on perception of place. Webster has explored how painting and sound can be correlated in projects such as 1000 Colours Blue, (2012) and is interested in the tension between the phenomenology of experience and the potential of painting to translate and communicate this. 
The opportunity to work with scientists and artist from a variety of disciplines around the theme of 'pollinator's has enabled Webster to gain a rich understanding of an alternative but interrelated sensory world. One key idea stimulated from these dialogues and insights has been to think about colour as iridescent (refracted light) rather than as purely reflective (paint). Webster wishes to experiment with creating textured surfaces, on metal for example, to make reflected light as iridescent colour together with using paint - as a means to explore and alternative perception of place. In addition, the opportunity to extend this research into a multi-sensory installation in the Botanical Gardens is a very exciting prospect, where sent, sound, surface and colour could all be utilised to create an experience which can be appreciated by a wide audience, including those who are visually or physically impaired.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Arriva UK Trains Limited</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:description>Network Partnerships for the Production of Artworks ( Heart of Wales Line )</gtr:description><gtr:id>04806BED-3EF1-48E3-9A33-366BC8D3FE5A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>No outcomes as yet.

This is a tourist line as it passes through mostly scenic and rural landscapes, from Llanelli to Shrewsbury. Upon being invited as a proposed collaborator in the project the Chair of the Development Committee attended the Introductory Networking Event and took an active role. in discussion one of the research team suggested re- naming the line The Bee Line, and this proposal was taken forward to the management of Arriva Trains and accepted in September 2016. 

Of the fourteen art/science projects planned, two arts projects are planned for the line and in addition the Networking event and subsequent meetings and Art Crit have enabled both scientific and creative expertise to be contributed towards the plans. In addition the PI's expertise has been instrumental in the production of the new branding and exhibition potential of the line, with the intention of each station adopting a species of bee. This collaboration will extend beyond the life of the project, as the railway line will be celebrating its 150th anniversary in 2018, and more arts input is planned. The Bee Line will add significantly to public understand of the problems facing pollinators and bees in particular. 
Art projects planned are -
Project 7: Buzzing Machine
Artist - Dr Paul Jeff
Scientists -Duncan Coston and scientists at Reading University (Professor Simon Potts and Dr Tom Breeze)
Stakeholder - Gill Wright, Heart of Wales Railway Line
Based on Paul Klee's 1922 drawing 'Twittering Machine', which shows a hand-cranked contraption to which 4 birds appear to be tethered in a union of nature and the industrialised environment, this work comments on the uneasy balance between our natural pollinators such as bees, and the industrialised 'climate' that we have brought about. Whilst Klee's machine seemed to focus on the looming catastrophe of man's effects on the natural world, our 'Buzzing Machine' is primarily concerned with re-discovering the harmony that is necessary for all species to work together as one large machine. Collaborating with the Heart of Wales Railway Jeff envisages a machine similar to Klee's incorporating model bees, that will be mounted on a 'tea trolley' and can be wheeled up and down the carriages allowing children perhaps to turn the handle. Jeff also proposes that this mobile installation contain a sound piece, the machinery of which can be concealed under the cloth covering the trolley. The sound piece to consist of multiple recordings by the choirs of the towns up and down the railway line and producing harmonies based on the buzz of the bumblebee. These recordings will be edited together to produce an interesting soundscape that will accompany the trolley on its journey. If a stop was long enough, for example, at the start and end of the line, then the trolley could be made to do a platform performance for travellers. To compliment this mobile pollination journey along the garden train line there will be a second 'cross-pollinating' trolley as a bridge between the art and science for the project and to convey both the pollinator science and public information. Scientist Dr Duncan Coston from the University of Reading will use this trolley to educate the travellers on the differences between pollinated foods and other foods in order to provide a link to pollination food security through a split service of foods pollinated by bees and those not. Again platform performances on this second trolley can be possible. 

Project 13: Bee Volunteers
Artist - Professor Andrea Liggins
Stakeholder - Gill Wright, The Heart of Wales Line (Bee Line)
Portraits of the volunteers at every station of the The Heart of Wales Line (32) involved in the Bee Project to plant pollinator gardens at every station, 120 miles of Station bee gardens. A plan developed through the early meetings of the Cross Pollination project is to add the name Bee Line to the Heart of Wales to show the work that this railway is undertaking to protect pollinators. The portraits will be exhibited at every station.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The Bug Farm School Event - pilot</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0C04DAAF-96C3-44DA-B4A8-5CF2BBFABD5A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As part of the Cross-pollination outreach agenda, together with scientist Dr Sarah Beynon, artists Dan Trivedy, Sarah Tombs and Professor Andrea Liggins ran a very successful pilot project at Dr Beynon's The Bug Farm (with Ysgol Croesgoch) to test the feasibility of getting participants to engage with and discover more about bugs and pollinators. Beynon and Tombs gave a talk on the science and art perspectives of insects, and then using recycled materials, the children made 'musical' instruments to imitate insect noises. Alongside this, they learnt about the science behind how and why bugs make sounds (e.g. grasshopper stridulation). They recorded their sounds individually and using the MadPad app on a iPad to make the sounds, which they then recorded together by the children as an insect orchestra. The resulting piece of music was then played back to them in an empty grain silo.

During 7th and 8th April 2016 the Intro Networking Event took place at the University of Wales Trinity Saint David, Alex Campus, Swansea and the National Botanic Garden of Wales.
During March the key participants of the project were finalised, and these attended this event joined by further interested parties. All the participants came together to share ideas, discuss their wide-ranging research and start the collaboration process.
The main aim of the Networking Intro Event was to initiate an inter-disciplinary research network on the vital subject of pollinators. During the project this network, through collaborative art projects, will explore how science and art research can interact to create new ideas and innovative methodologies for research into pollinators.
Participants of the event included award-winning scientists in the area of pollinator research from the UK and USA, high profile artists and arts researchers from the fields of aesthetics, perception and community arts. Important additions were linguists studying the language of environmental research and its affect on perceived values. The project leader Professor Andrea Liggins (University of Wales Trinity Saint David) has undertaken a number of science/art projects, most recently with Dr De Vere Head of Science and Conservation at the National Botanic Garden of Wales. Professor Michael Christie's (Aberystwyth University) expertise in the Valuation of Nature for Ecosystem Service Sustainability provided a further focus for the event.
A number of the representatives in policy-making organisations were also involved, such as members of the Pollinator Taskforce Wales and the Intergovernmental Science -Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). Co-I Christie has led a number of research projects focussing on the economic evaluation of nature and bio-diversity and was PI for the NERC Valuing Nature Steering project. Further participants at this event, included the Bumblebee Conservation Trust (Bee Wild project), BugLife, The Bee Garden at the National Botanic Garden of Wales (NBGW), Dr Beynon's Bug Farm, a representative from Natural Resources Wales (also a scientist), and a representative of the Heart of Wales Line and Arriva Trains Wales 120 Miles of Bee Garden project.
Day One started with presentations about art/science collaborations from the perspective of firstly the artist and then the scientist. These presentations were followed by sixteen Pecha Kucha, where each participant had 6 minutes and 40 seconds to describe their research.
PechaKucha or Pecha Kucha (pronounced 'pech-a-kee-shoe' and is Japanese for 'chit-chat') is a presentation style in which 20 slides are shown for 20 seconds each (6 minutes and 40 seconds in total). The format was conceived to keep presentations concise and fast-paced. Pecha Kucha has been used by artists and designers to view several presentations within a short time period.
This was followed by a speed-networking event where each individual scientist and artist had a chance to meet and discuss possible collaborative art projects for 15 mins.
Day Two progressed from these introductions with the objectives of sharing ideas and forming collaborative partnerships. The enthusiasm of the participants was tangible resulting in a multitude of possible art/science projects, which were arranged under themes. These were:-
1. Farming and Environment Policy
2. Multi-model
3. Pollinators and their Habitats
4. Preservation (Wild Bees)
5. Communication
6. Lines and Journeys
7. Perception and Motivation
Professor Mike Christie summed up in a presentation on the potential of the project to influence policy-making and this was followed by a tour of the National Botanic Garden of Wales, with a focus on the new butterfly house in the making by Head of Science and Conservation, Dr Natasha De Vere.
Follow-on Meetings
The thematic groups met in person (including visits to The Bee Lab Bristol, Dr Beynon's Bug Farm and the Science Lab at the National Botanic Garden of Wales) and via Skype to discuss and finalise the individual Art/Science projects. From these meetings, which took place prior to September 2016, a large number of art outputs were agreed, twice as many that were in the AHRC proposal. The networking to date therefor had been very successful, but more funding was required. An application to the Arts Council of Wales was made, which was successful and this ensured that the following projects could progress.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bee36b0703d4.94654191</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://crosspollinationartsciencecollaboration.wordpress.com/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>19550</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Arts Council of Wales Organisations Grant for Production</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Arts Council of Wales</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>DN:\20161086</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>9AE5CBEA-564B-453C-9DE4-B22864B2FCBD</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c01f6c82b8d7.20925389</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-11-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The project will not be complete until 31st November 2017.

a) The Chair of Heart of Wales Railway Development Group was invited to the Introductory Networking Event as this group was planning bee friendly gardens at each of the 27 stations on the line. At this event a suggestion was made by one of the attending artists for each station on the Heart of Wales Line ( Arriva Trains) to 'adopt' a species of bee. Following discussions of the concept an executive decision was taken in September 2016 to re-name The Heart of Wales Line from Llanelli to Shrewsbury (Arriva Trains) as The Bee Line, with stations along the route being branded for different bee species, and bee gardens at each station being developed with assistance of scientists involved in the project, from the National Botanic Garden of Wales and the Bumblebee Conservation Trust. Although not passing through populous areas, this line is primarily a tourist line and the renaming and branding will enhance the public's awareness of the plight of the bee, as well as other pollinators, particularly as it is celebrating its 150th anniversary in 2018 . The collaboration from the scientists with the volunteers developing the gardens will ensure greater success with this initiative.
b) The collaboration of Professor Andrea Liggins PI (arts and photography researcher) with Andrew Lucas, ( hoverfly scientist/researcher working for Natural Resources Wales) has resulted in some early impact. Liggin's research has been focused on finding ways of imaging those type of landscapes that have been seen to date as having little visual value, the lowland peat-bog, the grasslands and hedgerows. It is this type of environment, namely wet grassland, that is the preferred habitat of the hoverfly and some trial photographic artworks have been produced. Lucas believes that these non-descriptive, atmospheric images of his study sites, may help to convey the essence and in turn value of these non-picturesque and often overlooked landscapes. Therefor, the photographs have been and will be included in a number of papers and presentations by Lucas. Natural Resources Wales have decided to use them on their website under the theme of grassland management. Presentations to date include to the annual meeting of The British Ecological Society as well as three regional conservation groups. This collaboration is continuing.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>371DA6ED-F09A-46A8-BF8A-7F9ABC6BA385</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>58bed47e949805.74899719</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Environment,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>As Cross-pollination is a network project due to be completed 31st November 2017 the findings are at present initial findings. Only one aspect of the expected findings is described here, that of examining the perceptions of artists and scientists of one another and their disciplines, with the objective of developing greater understanding to inform this project and future art/science collaborations.
After the 2 day Intro Networking Event the participants were asked to complete a questionnaire to examine perceptions held at the beginning of the project. The questionnaire was designed and analyzed by Dr Sophie Bennett from Aberystwyth University. Two additional questionnaire surveys are planned to look at any changes of perception during the life of the project.
Section from Analysis of Cross-Pollination Questionnaire One - April 2016
Respondent profile
The majority of questionnaire are female (75%), based in Wales and are 35 years of age or over (64%). Most participants described themselves as scientists (42%) or artists (33%). 
Summary of results 
1. Difference between disciplines 
Results from the questionnaire indicate that, overall, participants do not view arts and science as completely distinct disciplines. The majority of participants were able to work with others around them, no matter what their discipline and became less aware of any differences as the event progressed. The commonality between disciplines was mentioned by some participants and realised during the networking event. Where differences do occur, participants described these as being differences of methods and methodology, education and overall focus. This was described by a number of participants as the difference in focus between end goal and process. Scientists use a framework of evidence and metrics to reach an end goal, whereas the arts concern themselves with the process, using qualitative methods and intuition. This was described by one participant as:
I still find it difficult to understand how a process can be useful if there is no end goal! In science, you talk about a piece of research in terms of what you found out. It sometimes seems condescending to ask an artist why they did something or what that art actually means/depicts.
Some participants describe differences as a result of opposite perspectives, where scientists use hypotheses to begin with and artists use grounded theory to arrive at a hypothesis: 
Formulating a hypothesis which is proven/disproved if often used in the scientific research and grounded theory where experimental works leads to the formulations of a hypothesis is used in artistic research.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Too early to tell.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>EB76E459-16FA-4A61-A769-E2ECA201E575</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58bedc2c86fb19.00985943</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://crosspollinationartsciencecollaboration.wordpress.com</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/N00597X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5B25B6A3-B218-4F11-8A9D-661236DF455C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agri-environmental science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>1A1A6805-9DC4-4BCE-BC70-9F2AA4FD093B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ecol, biodivers. &amp; systematics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>B94A2498-60DA-4055-A957-686B6CB42654</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Linguistics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BC807E7B-C08E-46F6-9E44-E65554CFBA4B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Applied Linguistics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5020ECC8-E0E8-434D-BDD5-663A9C04EFA2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Conservation Ecology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4237918D-61A8-47E0-91EE-65E98661A88B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Earth &amp; environmental</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A8CCE2FA-9D1B-4880-9BD3-C4C078F9CD7F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Fine Art HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1BF93D24-EF76-46A8-848B-CCD6008D74BC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Photography HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
