Aerospace</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/M004775/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This collaborative project aims to tackle an existing problem faced by female professionals in aviation and aerospace in the UK - a lack of suitable mentors to assist with career progression and provide general support and guidance. Academic research identifies role models and mentoring as having a positive impact upon career progression and the lack of mentors as a significant barrier to women's career progression. Research already conducted by the PI at Airbus Group identified a requirement for a formal mentoring scheme for female professionals that addresses their career progression needs and offers social support to what is a significantly under-represented group within the workforce. Through analysis of the requirements of female professionals in relation to a mentoring scheme, the PI and co-investigator (Co-I) will work collaboratively with key personnel at the RAS, RAF and Airbus Group, to build a robust mentoring scheme that will meet this critical need. 

This project offers the potential to share academic research, knowledge and expertise on the careers of female professionals in aviation and aerospace and the factors that may lead to their under-representation in the sector as well as their propensity to either leave the profession or to not return post-childbirth. It also offers the potential for the female professionals themselves, senior managers and HR practitioners to share knowledge and best practice to build upon what organisations are currently doing to attract and retain female engineers. The key working relationship will operate between the PI and at least two key senior personnel from each partner organisation, to bring together the academic expertise and practitioner experiences of staff at the University of the West of England (UWE) and the partner organisations to optimise the potential outcomes. 

The project will be designed around a project group comprising academics from UWE (the PI and Co-I) and professionals, human resource practitioners and senior managers at the partner organisations, to both share best practice and work collaboratively, to build a mentoring scheme specifically for female professionals. This group will meet for half a day on a monthly basis, to review the priorities of the partner organisations and discuss the progress of the project, where appropriate, as well as identify other key people to assist with the design and delivery of the project. Alongside this, the project group members will have the opportunity to network with senior key industry members and enjoy unprecedented access to information about other organisations' strategies for tackling the under-representation of women in aviation and aerospace, along with access to academic knowledge and research. 

This project group will evolve as other aviation and aerospace companies within the industry are contacted and invited to become part of a wider mentoring scheme. Key stakeholders will also be drawn into the group, at different stages, to discuss the needs of their own female members, e.g. Rolls Royce, Virgin Atlantic Airways, Augusta Westland, AJW Aviation and Little Blue Private Jets Limited, who have expressed a strong interest in participating. 

The intended outcome of this project will be a robust and sustainable mentoring scheme for female professionals within the aviation and aerospace industry, which extends beyond the boundaries of the participants, to impact on the sector at the national level. The mentoring scheme will be run 'on-line', and hosted by the RAS in London. The on-line service will offer information about the scheme and training materials and potential mentors, each of whom will be fully profiled. The RAS will host two networking events per year, to bring mentors and mentees together, to review the scheme and put forward ideas for its development.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project will impact a number of key groups and audiences through a combination of the practical outcomes achieved, their dissemination and replication across multiple user groups and the sector.

The impact of the research will be felt most strongly amongst female professionals, where a requirement for mentors who can relate to and understand their needs is evident from research already conducted by the PI. Meeting these needs has the potential to strengthen the psychological contract with the organisation, create a sense of belonging and improve personal career progression. It will also send a signal to these women that they are valued by the industry.

The next direct beneficiaries will be the partner organisations, through a deeper understanding of the needs of their female employees in relation to personal career development and how this may be enhanced by creating and adopting a mentoring approach that transforms what they currently offer. The project will also feed into the broader diversity debate and provide an increased understanding of how a lack of mentors affects women at different levels of the organisation, especially those at professional levels, where the greatest attrition occurs. The main overall impact for these companies will be an enhanced ability to attract and retain skilled female engineers thereby helping to reduce attrition costs and improving business capability. The outcome will be a practical programme for change in the gender in-balance in the partner organisations and allow the partners to implement a practical process for change.

The research will impact aviation and aerospace organisations generally through knowledge sharing and participation in reciprocal mentoring arrangements, leading to the development and adoption of best practice at marginal cost to themselves. This would be complemented by the vertical integration of first, second and third tier suppliers within each organisation's strategic supply chain. Extending the scheme vertically and laterally to other aviation and aerospace companies has the long-term potential to positively impact the skill shortage in the sector, inequality at senior management levels and improvements in overall sector performance. 

The research will enhance the activities of other key stakeholders, such as The Women's Engineering Society (WES) and Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) organisations that are committed to increasing the gender balance in science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) in the UK, through attracting, retaining and developing female talent within these disciplines. These key stakeholders will be a critical part of the final dissemination and will be useful for benchmarking/validation throughout the project.

The research will also impact and inform government initiatives and networks, such as Athena Swan, aimed at tackling women's under-representation in science, engineering and technology. Specifically, the government recognises SET as important for economic growth in the UK and the problems it faces because of the shortage of skilled engineers, exacerbated by the small number of women entering/remaining within the profession. 

This research will add to the body of knowledge within the academic community through a better understanding of women's under-representation in aviation and aerospace and how this may be tackled in part through mentoring. Dissemination of the research and the mentoring scheme will take place through academic workshops, symposiums, conferences and publications in academic and industry journals. The PI is a member of a number of academic (e.g. Gender in Management Special Interest Group), practitioner (Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development) and voluntary sector (Fair Play South West) networks. The aim is to disseminate the research findings and best practice through a range of events.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-27</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>64861</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The alta mentoring platform incorporates on-line mentor and mentee training, an interactive programme that must be completed by all alta mentors and mentees.

Mentee training enables potential mentees to familiarise themselves with alta mentoring, to learn what is expected from an alta mentee and to engage with the structured process involved in alta mentoring.

It was launched on 30th October, 2016, and to date, there are 92 women registered from the partner organisations (Airbus, RAeS and RAF). All mentors and mentees who have signed up have been matched (there are 53 mentees being mentored by a total of 39 mentors). Mentees and mentors are matched electronically which is seen as the most effective way of matching (as opposed to hand matching). This algorithm based matching which is less resource intensive than hand matching, ensures that the scheme is sustainable.

Mentoring is therefore live, active and building momentum. The project team made a decision to roll out alta gradually amongst the partners and the next marketing push will be at the RAF, followed by the RAeS, which is expected to boost numbers substantially. By the Autumn, 2016, the scheme will be open to women in the wider industry. This scheme is supporting women in the partner organisations in relation to career progression and general support. It is also enabling more experienced and/or senior women to develop as mentors.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56c72b0481af93.17682436</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>alta mentoring platform</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artefact (including digital)</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://alta-mentoring.com</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The alta handbook is a hardcopy and digital resource that accompanies and complements the bespoke alta training.

The site is live and interactive and we have made several improvements to date and aim to incorporate more changes in the future. One key change has been the matching questions completed by mentors and mentees - a decision was made to 'mirror' the questions and to remove some of the weightings. Some wording of questions was also changed to make the questions clearer. The alta group also continues to add news items to the live site and is looking at ways to develop alta for the future.</gtr:description><gtr:id>57B98D70-3717-4CF0-A917-7043270E611B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The aim has been to make the alta live site more user-friendly and to simplify the matching questions. These changes have recently been made and the new questions are currently being 'tested' by members of the project group and a small sample of women at Airbus, the RAeS and the RAF. Once we have established the new questions are more user-friendly, we will invite all of those registered with alta and 'not matched' to go back through the matching process by completing the revised questions. The impact will be that more matches are achieved.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bdac98471a44.25564127</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>alta Mentoring Platform</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artefact (including digital)</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://alta-mentoring.com</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Royal Air Force Museum</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Building a mentoring scheme to support women in aviation and aerospace</gtr:description><gtr:id>9E1C61D0-43A0-49A5-AD3D-BD26A02432AA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This collaboration has resulted in the design, delivery and launch of a founding partners (soon to be industry-wide) mentoring scheme for female professionals (alta) which itself is an innovation in the aviation and aerospace industry, launched in November, 2015, at the Royal Aeronautical Society's women's conference in London (http://alta-mentoring.com). The decision to restrict the scheme during its first year to the founding partners only, was in order to fully validate its design, operation and impact. To date, over ninety two women have joined and a second round of advertising and recruitment of mentors and mentees will take place during March, 2016, through promotion of the scheme at the Airbus International Women's Days on 8th and 11th March; and two alta networking events to be held in March and June, 2016 (to be held at UWE, Bristol and the Royal Aeronautical Society, London). From Autumn, 2016, the scheme will be opened up to the wider industry and we have already secured firm interest from a leading international bluechip company together with an international trading association, based in the USA. The focus for the UWE team during this first year of operation will be to measure the effectiveness of alta with the participant mentors and mentees against a pre-agreed set of target outcomes. A related output has been the design and delivery of bespoke face-to-face and on-line training, as a means to provide women across the sector with greater access to mentoring and career support at a lower per capita cost. This has been underpinned by rigorous face-to-face training which was designed and delivered by the UWE team to prepare both mentors and mentees for this innovative on-line programme (co-designed with the founding partners).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56b22baa5ac076.52200626-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The partners (Royal Aeronautical Society (RAeS), Royal Air Force (RAF), and Airbus,) made a substantial contribution to the project. Most partners attended a number of the project meetings and the co-founding partner from the Royal Aeronautical Society attended all meetings. Each partner contributed via a number of means, including, providing important contextual information on their organisations and the industry in general, providing access to the design and operation of any existing mentoring schemes in their organisations for benchmarking purposes, assisting the UWE team with access to women and employers in their organisations and industry to participate in the interviews and focus groups, distributing the survey to female members of the Royal Aeronautical Society, and generally raising awareness and encouraging engagement with employees. Perhaps most importantly, the partners secured 'buy-in' at senior management levels within the participating organisations. The partners contributed to the design of the mentoring scheme platform in a number of ways, some commenting on draft designs and narratives, while the Royal Aeronautical Society partner played a key role in the technical design of the mentoring platform, being the lead player and liaising between the project group and the delivery platform designers and technicians. Partners commented upon drafts of the face-to-face training materials and inputted substantially to the on-line training, including providing several of their female professionals to take part in the short video clips of mentoring rehearsals which are now being used as part of the on-line training. The partners also played a critical role during the launch of the mentoring scheme (alta) in October, 2015, highlighting its importance within the industry and encouraging women to get involved. The partners also inputted by commenting on a number of draft documents produced by the UWE team, including the survey, focus group and interview questions, the face to face and on-line training and the alta handbook. They have each played a key role in advertising/promoting the scheme within their own organisations, the recruitment of mentors from the wider industry and acting as advocates for the alta mentoring scheme.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The PI, as one of the founding members of alta, worked alongside and led a team at the University of the West of England (referred to hereafter as the UWE team). The team comprised the PI, a co-investigator, a consultant and a research associate. The UWE team collectively contributed to the project in a number of substantial ways. The PI set the agenda, organised and chaired the project group meetings which were held approximately every six weeks. These meetings were a critical aspect of the project as they facilitated face-to-face collaboration with the project partners on the co-design of the mentoring scheme and were a space to discuss and feed back progress on the research element of the project. The UWE team took overall responsibility for the research, leading the design and implementation of the empirical research instruments (a survey, interviews and focus groups); conducting and leading the research with circa 250 women (professionals and employers) across the industry and analysing, reporting back and drawing upon these findings. The findings were fundamental to the design of the mentoring scheme which was always intended to be, 'for women, by women' in both its design and operation. The design of the technology for the mentoring scheme was led by the Royal Aeronautical Society project partner with support from the UWE team and other project partners, who inputted collectively into its design as the project progressed and as the research findings were further understood. The UWE team also led on research dissemination through promotion events at the partner organisations as well as at a number of events at organisations, within and outside the industry, in order to communicate the research more widely. This included presenting on the research findings at corporate and academic events and conferences. The UWE team led on the design and delivery of the face-to-face and on-line training for mentors and mentees, as well as the design and delivery of an alta handbook, with input from the project partners on draft copies.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Women in Aviation and Aerospace Committee (WAAC)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Building a mentoring scheme to support women in aviation and aerospace</gtr:description><gtr:id>584AEF4A-8256-4E8F-888D-B8A6F1395A0C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This collaboration has resulted in the design, delivery and launch of a founding partners (soon to be industry-wide) mentoring scheme for female professionals (alta) which itself is an innovation in the aviation and aerospace industry, launched in November, 2015, at the Royal Aeronautical Society's women's conference in London (http://alta-mentoring.com).

The decision to restrict the scheme during its first year to the founding partners only, was in order to fully validate its design, operation and impact. To date, over ninety two women have joined and a second round of advertising and recruitment of mentors and mentees will take place during March, 2016, through promotion of the scheme at the Airbus International Women's Days on 8th and 11th March; and two alta networking events to be held in March and June, 2016 (to be held at UWE, Bristol and the Royal Aeronautical Society, London). From Autumn, 2016, the scheme will be opened up to the wider industry and we have already secured firm interest from a leading international bluechip company together with an international trading association, based in the USA. The focus for the UWE team during this first year of operation will be to measure the effectiveness of alta with the participant mentors and mentees against a pre-agreed set of target outcomes.

The findings from the focus groups and interviews with female professionals, employers and representatives from other professional bodies, were fed back to the group. The research findings were intended to form the key underpinning foundation to the design of the mentoring scheme (alta) and it was agreed that in light of these findings, we were able to proceed with the design and launch of the mentoring scheme based largely upon what female professionals and employers told us they would look for from the scheme and what they felt would work in practice. For example, the 'woman to woman' aspect of the scheme was welcomed by the majority of research participants which confirmed to the project group that having a scheme for women only was both feasible and practical. Findings from the research also indicated that while women would welcome a mentoring scheme which enabled them to be mentored via social media, they also felt that the first one or two meetings should be face to face. Being matched with the 'right' mentor was also identified in the research as being of overriding importance to the women and this helped us to focus on designing the mentor/mentee matching questions. The industry partners commented on how the findings had helped them to further understand the needs of women in their industries. For example, the RAF partner commented that the findings had helped her organisation to raise awareness of challenges women face in the 'pipeline', that they intended to include women in development decisions in the future and that they would do more to empower women to seek development opportunities, especially through alta.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56c348f7869fb1.55773777</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>unionlearn Blog Entry</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>29E4EA1C-4D9A-4EA7-96D5-1512CD5FA151</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A published blog entry, entitled, 'Mentoring scheme for women in aviation: the first of its kind', on the TUC Unionlearn blog.

Training covered the rationale for the mentoring scheme, the research findings from the research project and mentor/mentee training, drawing upon a combination of theory, practice and role play/mentoring rehearsals. The problems associated with gender stereotyping in the workplace and the importance of mentoring for women in male dominated organisations/industries was also covered. Written feedback from the training sessions indicates that participants found the training to be of 'good' or 'excellent' quality, that the mentoring rehearsals and learning styles sessions had been particularly helpful and that key learning about how to be a good mentor/mentee and how to approach formal, structured mentoring had been useful. Perceived barriers to mentoring, such as gaining line manager approval to participate in alta, how to deal with 'tricky' situations in mentoring meetings, knowing how to approach mentoring for the first time and making time out of a busy working day for mentoring, were also addressed. Subsequent mentor/mentee training will be delivered on-line, via the alta mentoring platform.

A panel of male and female speakers from the media, politics, corporate organisations and the public sector debated the issue of a lack of diversity in the aviation and aerospace industry. The key question for the debate was, who are the best change agents for diversity? The debate raised a number of fascinating and thought-provoking issues on how to make the workforce more diverse. The audience, from a wide variety of organisations in the industry, answered questions on what needs to be done to encourage more women into engineering and aerospace; why we need diversity; who can make a difference; and why progress to make the workforce more diverse has been so slow. Following the debate, a networking event enabled us to speak to delegates and members of the alta mentoring scheme. Those who were matched were generally happy with the matching process. We also had the opportunity to talk to alta and WAAC non-members who had seen the flyers for alta and were keen to find out more. We were able to point them towards the alta mentoring on-line platform. This event enabled us to engage with some current alta members and to also encourage non-members to join.

Key questions included:

? What is inclusion best practice in society?
? What does industry need to be doing to address our diversity requirements?
? What role can the Society play in supporting industry and other partners?

The aim of the workshop was to define the strategic objectives for the RAeS, in conjunction with their partners, and outline recommended actions and a work plan to achieve success for the benefit of the aerospace and aviation industry.

The workshop included several presentations. Ana Lopes (the Co-I) presented an outline of the alta mentoring scheeme, including highlights of the academic research that underpinned the scheme, in the gender strand of the workshop.

Finally, we asked what we were doing 'right' and also how we could improve. Responses were generally encouraging around matching and the completion of matching questions. The information we received on the usefulness of the alta website and further services members would like us to offer alta, has been invaluable in enabling us to make immediate improvements (i.e. to the matching questions) and also how we can improve the technology we currently have. Members also wanted to see more regular 'newsfeeds' and more communication from alta, which we are currently working on.

Earlier meetings focused on alta member feedback, membership updates, promotion of alta at external events, changes to the matching questions and more recently, a strategy for taking alta forward into the industry under the guidance of the RAeS. This has involved the writing and consideration of the RAeS business plan and their future plans for the expansion of alta, as well as interest from an external investor.

We have seen a growth in the number of members since the last report in February, 2016 (currently 150, with 44 mentee/mentor matches). The scheme continues to operate amongst and to be supported by, the founding members and will be launched to the wider industry during 2017. Restricting the scheme to the founding partners during the first year has enabled the project team (hereafter referred to as the alta project team) to fully validate alta's design, operation and impact. For example, we have discussed ways of updating the technology platform (and how to fund this), have already revised the mentor/mentee matching questions and re-launched these for new matches (and for those not already matched to go back through the matching process) and ensuring the future sustainability of alta. We have also surveyed alta members (August, 2016) to ascertain their views and experiences on the mentoring scheme so far, including the matching process and what members would like to see from alta in the future. Feedback from the survey (as well as qualitative, face-to-face feedback from events) has been positive.

The alta team continues to meet on a regular basis to take alta phase 2 forward (its launch to the wider industry). Nine project group meetings have been held since February, 2016 (when the original report was submitted) where we have reviewed past and planned future alta events, discussed how we will open up alta to the wider industry (and how this will be funded) reviewed and made changes to the mentor/mentee matching questions and updates (and associated costs) to the alta technology platform. Members of the alta team continue to communicate with their internal alta members and report back to the team with feedback and suggestions. The PI, Co-I and members of the alta team have attended a series of events to promote alta (see section on 'engagement activities').

The partner organisations, key beneficiaries of the project's impact, launched a second phase of advertising of the scheme in 2016 as they wished to promote a gradual, phased, sign-up to the scheme. They have embedded alta into their development programmes and offer alta as a mentoring scheme for women only, alongside their more generic, existing mentoring schemes. The founding partners recognised the need for a women-only mentoring scheme and have responded positively to alta because it offers an enhanced understanding of the needs of their female professionals and the opportunity to offer personal career development through the mentoring scheme, at little financial cost to themselves.
Emerging impact can also be identified at individual level. Indeed, the alta mentors and mentees, benefit directly from the project as the alta scheme supports and contributes to their career progression. Mentees continue to benefit directly with practical advice and help in addressing career barriers and challenges. Mentors also continue to benefit by developing their mentoring skills, both through the training provided by the scheme and through the practice of mentoring other professional women within the framework and with the support of the alta scheme. 

The research will impact more widely once it is open up to the wider industry (2017) through the setting-up of knowledge sharing and participation in reciprocal mentoring arrangements and the long-term potential of extending the scheme to others in the industry. Evidence of alta's impact was made clear by the General Manager and Human Resource Director at Airbus, when recently presenting at the Distinguished Address at the University of the West of England, Bristol. One of the key achievements in supporting employees cited by the speaker was the alta mentoring scheme.

Moreover, impact is also starting to emerge at industry level. As a significant number of dissemination activities have been developed (see Engagement Activities section), the scheme, as well as its main findings, are becoming well known in the industry, especially among the RAeS corporate members. These organisations have benefited from the knowledge exchange and have gained a better understanding of the needs of their female professional employees and the benefits of mentoring. There are a number of future events planned throughout 2017, including 'soft launches' of alta to the industry and networking events at the Royal Air Force, the Royal Aeronautical Society (RAeS) and Airbus. 

The current challenge is ensuring we have sufficient funding for alta's development and sustainability. The alta team is currently considering two options. The first is the securing of funding for the development and future of alta via the RAeS. Two key members of the RAeS are currently putting together a business plan, which will be discussed at the next alta Project Group meeting in mid-March. The Aerospace Growth Partnership, which works closely with the RAeS and Airbus, has already expressed a strong interest in financially supporting alta. The second option is a commercial investor, who is also putting together a business plan. Both options could also include the introduction of membership fees (both individual and corporate) to generate income and make alta financially sustainable; and/or sponsorship from some of the larger corporations within the sector. All avenues are currently being explored and we envisage making a final decision, based on the business plans submitted, by mid-2017. The PI continues to lead the alta Project Group and to work closely with all members. Following the survey of members in August, 2016, the UWE team will carry out interviews with alta matched pairs (mentors/mentees) in the summer, 2017, to begin to measure the impact that being a member of alta is having on mentors and mentees, in relation to gaining/giving support and career and social support for mentees.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>DA5D6D20-69BF-49F8-AB8E-32C4E70DCF9F</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56c883da1c4df8.76670815</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Electronics,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Security and Diplomacy,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The research underpinning this project enabled us to gain a deep understanding of the challenges faced by women in the aviation and aerospace industry and how some of these challenges may be addressed through mentoring, through the alta mentoring scheme in particular. Despite their proven abilities, negative views remain about women in male dominated industries and organisations, which is evidenced through our research. We were in contact with circa 250 women across the industry who identified a number of challenges in this male dominated industry. These challenges included the perception by others that engineering is a 'masculine' profession and therefore not suitable for women; engineering not being sufficiently promoted by schools and careers advisers; the lack of fit between being a mother and pursuing a career as an engineer; a lack of mentors for career and social support; and the strong desire for female professionals in this industry to be mentored by another woman.

From the research, we learned that the majority of research participants had very little previous or current experience of being mentored. Informal mentoring was much more common but this tended to be ad hoc, more available to senior women and not sufficient for structured career mentoring. Overall, mentoring was identified as important but not necessarily available to most respondents. While respondents were very aware of the benefits of mentoring, most were not being mentored. Mentoring was seen as especially valuable to women because it could help with issues that specifically impact women, such as maternity leave and return to work, work-life balance and childcare issues, opportunities to network with other women in the industry and gaining general support. Many had not had the opportunity to mentor others and indicated they wished to become mentors through the alta scheme. Many were interested in finding a mentor within the wider industry and many expressed a preference for those mentors to be female. 

Through this research, we learned that female professionals and employers in the industry could see the benefits to be gained from the mentoring scheme. They felt that there was a lack of female mentors within the industry and that alta could help to address this. Many especially welcomed the 'woman to woman' aspect of alta. Following on from this, respondents also felt there was a definite need for alta for a number of reasons: it would offer mentors for women at all levels of the industry; help women to gain an outside perspective on the industry; seek development opportunities; and help to connect with and share experiences with other women. Importantly, employers were positive about alta, for a number of reasons, including: enabling women to seek guidance and learn from other women; gaining a mentor outside of the immediate working environment; helping to address women's issues and boosting women's confidence; facilitating access to female role models; empowering women through mutual support; and helping to grow the female talent pool. Employers also felt that alta would send a strong message to schools that the industry is doing something about its shortage of females. 

alta's women centred approach is based on the concept of empowerment, its aim being to raise women's levels of confidence and self-esteem. By enabling female professionals to share experiences, alta seeks to break down isolation and enable women to actively develop networks, something that research indicates they often struggle with when compared to men. By creating a community of female mentors and mentees, alta provides female professionals with unique opportunities to connect with other women in a community, based on common experiences. 

Leading and participating in this research project has enabled the UWE team to work collaboratively with individuals and their organisations outside of the University sector and to engage with 'real life' issues experienced by women in public and private sector organisations, through knowledge exchange. This has been an extremely positive experience and has enabled us to build strong and lasting relationships with these partners. While we are currently the alta Project Group, once the RAeS has taken alta in-house, this project group will become the official alta Advisory Committee and we will continue to work with the RAeS to ensure the success and sustainability of alta. This will entail quarterly meetings at the RAeS in London, to monitor progress and discuss future plans and events.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings have been widely disseminated (see section on engagement activities) and taken forward into the design of alta, the on-line mentor and mentee training and the alta handbook. The alta Project Group continues to draw upon the findings and have utilised these to update the alta platform and delivering presentations/engagement activities on the progress and future of alta. More recently, the Project Group members have utilised the findings from the survey of alta members (summer, 2016) to consider the success of alta so far, which improvements to alta are desired for our members, how we can gradually improve upon what we offer (i.e. through enhanced technology) and how we can make alta sustainable in the future. All three non-academic partners have publicised and reported on the research project, for example, via organisation-wide publications and websites and promotion events delivered by themselves and the academic team. All partners will hold 'soft launches' once the terms of reference are agreed with the RAeS and alta opens out to the wider industry. The project partners will continue to disseminate the research findings through word of mouth, publications and websites, especially as more organisations are invited into the mentoring scheme. Further dissemination events are already planned for 2017, including the RAeS Women's Conference, alta networking events and 'soft launches' at the partner organisations. All three non-academic partners have already demonstrated how they have taken the findings forward and how this has influenced policy, practice and diversity strategies. Findings can also be taken forward into other male dominated industries where women face similar challenges and are already being utilised by the Principal and Co-investigators into a related project on women in a number of male dominated industries. This will enable us to build stronger links with alta. Finally, the academic team, is currently writing up research findings for academic publications, including a chapter in an international book on women in male dominated jobs (due to be published later in 2017) and two academic journal articles. We will also present on the alta mentoring scheme at the European Sociological Conference in Athens, Greece, in August, 2017.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>333FCC13-F65E-43F0-AA93-9B2E9D45BCB6</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56c884628df902.94985928</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Chemicals,Construction,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Electronics,Energy,Environment,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology,Security and Diplomacy,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://alta-mentoring.com</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Design and delivery of face-to-face and on-line training to female professionals and employers in the industry</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1BD5BCA9-4555-4126-835C-38BD5FA35D88</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Bespoke mentor/mentee training (both face-to-face and on-line via the alta mentoring platform) was designed and delivered by the UWE team, designed with industry partner input. A total of three face-to-face training sessions were delivered with a combination of women seeking to join alta as mentors or mentees. The training covered the rationale for the mentoring scheme, the research findings and mentor training, using a combination of theory and practice, the latter involving role play and mentor/mentee rehearsals. Gender stereotyping in the workplace and the importance of mentoring for women in male dominated organisations/industries was also covered. 

Written feedback from the training sessions indicates that participants found the training to be 'good' or 'excellent', that the mentoring rehearsals and learning styles sessions had been particularly helpful and that key learning about how to be a good mentor/mentee and how to approach formal, structured mentoring had been useful. We also had the opportunity to discuss and address any perceived barriers to mentoring identified by participants, such as gaining line manager approval to participate in alta, how to deal with 'tricky' situations in mentoring meetings, knowing how to approach mentoring for the first time and making time out of a busy working day for mentoring. 

Subsequent mentor/mentee training will be delivered on-line, via the alta mentoring platform. This training has been developed from the face-to-face training and all alta mentors and mentees are required to complete the on-line training before they can join alta. All partners believe that this training is fundamental to the design and delivery of the alta mentoring platform, especially the on-line training, given the UWE team were limited (financially) to delivering just one or two face-to-face training sessions per partner. On-line training will help to ensure the quality of the alta mentoring and that mentors and mentees are fully aware of the expectations of the alta mentoring scheme. The conversion rate between those who attended the face-to-face training sessions and joining the mentoring scheme is very high.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56c70ebdcc52a2.73799415</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>The Royal Air Force testimonial on influence on policy/practice</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2E2C43FC-BA8B-4E72-BF41-C2F81F73A08A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Royal Air Force partner has provided evidence on the impact of the project/mentoring scheme to date, through the following testimonial: 

The research findings, delivered to HQ Air Personnel, offered immediate feedback and provided a number of 'quick wins' which were delivered in 2014/15. These included raising awareness to all about the challenges facing the RAF female pipeline, the inclusion of women in development decisions and the empowerment of women in the RAF to seek development opportunities. As a direct result of these research findings, the RAF opened the alta mentoring scheme to all serving females rather than limiting this to senior managers, as originally intended. 

This vital development will also support reverse mentoring, now accepted as a strategic priority across the broader under-represented communities in the RAF. Broader research outcomes, representing the views, opinions and experiences from a variety of professional women have shaped the quality mentor training and the alta handbook offers a high level of confidence to aspiring females that the mentoring scheme (alta) has a professional image.

Organisational branding (RAF) across the alta platform will also support recognition that the RAF is an employer of choice for females in the future. Development of the software platform is believed to be excellent, there is clear and professional imagery of alta and early engagement with serving females in the RAF has provided positive feedback. This had led to the alta mentoring programme being advertised widely across RAF units; the formation of a social media group dedicated to RAF female development opportunities; and reverse mentoring opportunities being supported.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56c7083aaf2fb2.05532979</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Airbus testimonial on influence on policy/practice</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A42E32D6-E967-4472-B64C-324039E016A6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Airbus partner has provided evidence on the impact of the project/mentoring scheme to date, through the following testimonial: 

The research work conducted by the UWE team strengthened the promotion of diversity topics within Airbus by providing significant fact based information and in depth analysis of the various cases encountered in the interviews and focus groups that took place in the company. Some of the women interviewed expressed strong interest in a female based mentoring scheme as a way to obtain a mentor more easily within the organisation, especially a more senior female mentor, and also as a means to be able to find a mentor who might be able to provide more suitable advice as she may have experienced similar situations. The project has allowed the creation of a community more aware of the diversity and inclusion topics and raised the profile in avery positive ways as tangible actions have been the outcome of the project. 

On top of the launch of the scheme itself, various other awareness sessions open to all employees were set up, where both mentoring and diversity topics were presented and openly discussed, giving opportunity to all present to raise their concerns and relay their experiences. In relation to the project, information about mentoring and diversity was widely distributed within the company via the women's network newsletter, the company news magazine, the HR internal monthly update and various online based tools (Airbus TV, Connect @ Airbus, Airbus People Portal, etc). This helped to change the perception of what women and men need to do in order to develop a more inclusive working environment: alta provides a development platform for women, that Airbus believes can only be achieved also with the support, understanding and inclusion of men. 

alta provides a key complement to the already existing mentoring practices within the company, providing further opportunities for women to become both mentors and mentees. It was also key to help increase women's personal profile and provide confidence to women to become the mentors of the future generations. Thanks to the strong collaboration with the RAeS, this effect was also applied to the wider industry through the Society's access to their corporate partnership base, providing a platform for cross fertilisation between aerospace companies. This activity was also conducted as part of the UK Government National Initiative for the aerospace sector development called the Aerospace Technology Institute, with specific regards to the pillar on skills development for the UK in the aerospace sector. The UK Government Aerospace Growth Strategy clearly indicates the need to develop a skilled workforce as a key enabler for success in the industry for the UK. 

Several events, awareness sessions and face to face training courses were organised and delivered by the research team. This had the positive effect of enhancing the current practices not only through the scheme itself but also by generating awareness on the diversity topics, a lot of other activities and initiatives were promoted. In particular, further networking opportunities have been created, &amp;quot;Career go live&amp;quot; type of events to promote career development and a general emphasis of mentoring type of activities, whether formal or informal. A strong effect was also obtained in promoting mentoring in general, the benefits of mentoring for both mentors and mentees and encouraging people to be more personally aware of the need to be proactive about their own development. To this purpose a feature article on mentoring was published on the company wide magazine, Airbus ONE. The article featured information about the benefits of mentoring itself for all employees and for both mentors and mentees which was aimed at raising the use of mentoring as a development tool for all. On top of other mentoring schemes available within the company, the article specifically mentioned the alta scheme as a further tool available for women within the company. 

Details of the project were presented by the company representative on the alta team. Moreover, thanks to the high profile of the project, senior management was successfully engaged to support and endorse mentoring as a development opportunity and often offered their own experience as examples. This provided some useful role models for the audience that would not have been available otherwise. 

The eLearning platform (on-line training) which has been created as a spin-off of the project, has been recognised at a company level as key for the sustainability of the scheme, but also more broadly, as in line with the encouragement of more e-based learning and for more people to take advantage of this development opportunity. 

alta has contributed to human resources and/or equality and diversity policy and practice in a number of ways. The results of the research enabled us to prioritise certain key actions to break down barriers and support women more effectively within the organisation at all levels of their career development. Firstly, one of the key successes was the decision from senior management to endorse the alta scheme and support it in the business. Secondly, the decision to link this platform and this development opportunity to Industry wide standards, for example linked to the WISE 10 steps. It also enabled Airbus to separate between quick actions and longer term changes to be implemented through the increased feedback received from the participants to the various project meetings and awareness sessions. It also confirmed with evidence based information, some of the already identified issues and barriers and provided more strength and support in promoting change.

The initial response to the launch of the scheme has been very positive with many of the Airbus women involved in the research/development phase signing up to the scheme. The project has also allowed for a significant widening of the networking opportunities both within and outside of the company (for example, the two launch events organised by RAeS in London were well attended by Airbus women) and there are further events planned for this year to continue to promote the alta mentoring platform, for example at International Womens Day on March 8th, 2016. There is also a plan to ensure that the wider Airbus community benefits from the scheme, both at UK level between the various Airbus divisions and internationally within the other European sites. The alta scheme has also had great influence in allowing us to promote mentoring as a development opportunity not only for mentees but also for mentors, allowing for more women to gain more confidence to become mentors and also allowing all levels of career and professional levels within the company to make use of this tool. 

One final point which should be stressed is that some considerable learning and collaborative effort was especially undertaken by the company representatives and the extended project team that worked very successfully together throughout the duration of the project.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56c70bd07a63d2.90482365</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>alta on-line mentor/mentee training</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>90A55447-353A-430D-93FC-D3079617123F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The alta mentoring scheme continues to offer its on-line training to mentors and mentees. It is a requirement that all alta mentors undergo on-line training before they can register as a mentor. This allows us to 'quality control' the mentors who join alta. The training is also now offered to all alta mentees, should they wish to engage with it. This training package has enabled, so far, the training of 150 mentors and mentees, which is a substantial training impact, when coupled with the face-to-face training we delivered with women from the founding partners, as part of the mentoring scheme project. Undergoing training will have a positive impact on alta members and questions on its impact will be included in our planned impact study in the summer, 2017.

The General Manager at Airbus is also involved in the AGP initiative and has indicated that there is support for alta. Links with the AGP are also established within the RAeS and they are currently in discussions about how they can best support alta (financially) and ensure its sustainability. One of key drivers for the AGP is that it can have an impact on its key drivers to address the skills gap and issues of diversity in the industry.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bda98d8e8ce6.39056014</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>alta Project Group</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>01BEB1CD-37B8-4A2C-8928-8C3E5A42C7DD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The alta Project Group has formed into an advisory group for the purposes of taking alta forward.

The research project and the development of the alta mentoring programme offered women in the Aviation and Aerospace industry the opportunity to express some of the frustrations, limitations and challenges experienced by them in the industry while building their careers. It was interesting for the society to see the lack of progress that the industry has made and gave an opportunity to revise the approach to supporting women and aviation businesses in their thinking around gender diversity. The RAeS is very focused on its role as 'thought leader' in this area and want to support aviation businesses to create new tools and to develop strategies to solve issues. The industry will see a shortage of people over the next 10 years unless we can attract more women, particularly in technical engineering, flight operations and aircraft development roles. 

The alta programme will be embedded into the strategy for supporting women in the industry and for increasing gender diversity, particularly at higher management levels in aircraft manufacturing organisations and airlines. Over the next three years we expect the impact to increase as the mentoring scheme is rolled out to more companies in the UK. alta will be marketed through networking events, media campaigns and on-line campaigns throughout the RAeS. The aim is to highlight the cross company industry programme to women across the industry, reaching as many women as possible and supporting the development of women, changing the thinking of our industry businesses and making a positive change in the gender diversity of the industry.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56c70dae366153.05451668</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The UWE research team conducted approximately thirty interviews with female professionals, employers and key stakeholders in professional bodies.</gtr:description><gtr:id>4FB48639-D7D9-43A5-B203-A0BBE4154ABB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Through these interviews, the UWE team was able to gather key information from a number of female professionals about their career backgrounds, experiences and benefits gained from mentoring (if any) so far, quality of mentoring received and reasons for not having a mentor.

Interviews with representatives of key professional bodies (i.e. Women's Engineering Society) were helpful in relation to discussing current challenges facing women, any mentoring schemes they were aware of/involved in and suggestions for our own mentoring scheme. Information from this combination of interviews was fundamental and critical to the design of the alta mentoring scheme, especially in relation to considering how mentors and mentees would make contact/meet, developing the questions that mentors and mentees would need to complete in order to be matched and ensuring we had experienced female mentors from across the industry.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56c71d0288bac2.04464754</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Interviews with female professionals, employers and representatives from key professional bodies in the industry</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>A qualtrics survey was distributed to all female members of the Royal Aeronautical Society at the beginning of the research project.

The survey revealed that just one quarter of respondents were currently being mentored and that current or past mentors had been predominantly male within their employer organisations. Most identified a lack of female mentors within the industry. Respondents expressed a preference for mentoring predominantly around career progression with an element of social support. Half the respondents put themselves forward as potential mentors under the proposed alta mentoring scheme and also volunteered to take part in follow-up interviews (whilst retaining their anonymity in relation to their survey answers). The findings from the survey were utilised by the project group to consider the issues facing women in the industry and how an industry-wide mentoring scheme may help to assist these women.

Just 5 women have not managed to find a match through this process, indicating a high success rate in enabling women to find a suitable mentor who can help with their career development and offer general support.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56c8632a3597d6.80477155</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>alta mentoring platform</gtr:title><gtr:type>Webtool/Application</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://alta-mentoring.com</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B6A12B99-6A18-4FC2-A16A-811B089DA504</gtr:id><gtr:title>Mentoring Professional Women in Aviation and Aerospace</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>CESR Review</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/cb2a8282524f944d090358c01088e88d"><gtr:id>cb2a8282524f944d090358c01088e88d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lopes, A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56b21c60340d44.95542338</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9D189854-00E7-4F82-BCF2-C3DA4EAD3DAF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Celebrating International Women's Day: the alta mentoring scheme</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>CESR Review</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/914fff5b550e38c974761ba744c42710"><gtr:id>914fff5b550e38c974761ba744c42710</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Durbin, S.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56cc95589a1286.33421818</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/M004775/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>231B8162-9E4D-46FB-BB69-0A4B66598C2B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Employment Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>46FB536B-9B51-49F1-B2DF-5A14789705F2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Resource Management</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
