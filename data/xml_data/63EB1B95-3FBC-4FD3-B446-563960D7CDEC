On the one hand, China presents new opportunities of maximizing the uptake and application of science in a climate of sluggish economic growth. On the other hand, a persistent deficiency in ensuring responsible research conduct casts a shadow on the public attitude towards research conducted in, and with, China. Cases such as locally authorized stem cell therapy and unsupervised GM food trials not only has the effect of damaging China's own scientific reputation, but also impairs global public trust of biotechnologies (Moreno, 2010, Qiu, 2012).

This project proposes a timely and ambitious study on the accountability problem in China's life science governance through a comparative study of stem cell research and GM foods. This draws on my extensive network and previous research in both fields. Through a combination of semi-structured interviews, focus groups and international workshops, this project engages with regulators, scientists and civil society actors in both China and the UK. It makes an important contribution to the co-production of alternative ways to address public accountability in the life sciences. The analytical focus will be on the following questions:

RQ1: What are the regulatory standards and procedures used in defining, selecting and sustaining accountable research practice in stem cell research and GM foods in China? How are the development of the 'legitimation devices' shaped by domestic and international debates? 
RQ2: How are the power dynamics among scientists, regulators and bioethisists constructed in stem cell and GM food regulations? What are the similarities and differences in the legitimisation of research practice in both fields? 
RQ3: What forms of communication are needed to make stem cell and GM research more accessible to, and assessable by, the public? How can China improve its effective accountability to its potential research users and collaborators?

Stem cell research and GM foods make for excellent case studies. They provide complementary views on the project's three core research questions. Stem cell and GM technologies are both highly visible and controversial fields in China, but they represent the opposite ends of risk framing. While China's GM food regulation consists of a 'strong precautionary element', China's stem cell regulation arguably resembles a 'proactionary' approach (Tiberghien, 2010; Zhang, 2012). Despite these differences, stem cell and GM technologies in China share a similar regulatory history and governing structure. Both are predominately regulated by the Ministry of Health, the China Food and Drug Authority and the Ministry of Science and Technology. This difference in regulatory rationales and overlap in governance structures will provide rich comparable data for the research questions.

Addressing the accountability problem is not only crucial for China's goal of becoming a trusted player in the competitive and skeptical global community, but is also important for enabling efficient international collaborations and promoting research integrity in the life sciences. Thus, this research will be important to a number of non-academic users, such as 1) regulators and research funders in both China and Europe; 2) transnational scientific societies; 3) international civil society organisations, such as patient advocacy groups, environmental NGOs and 4) hospitals and biotechnology enterprises. Given the interdisciplinary nature this research, this project also enriches academic debates in a variety of disciplines, such as sociology, governance studies, bioethics, China studies and the life sciences.

Planned outputs includes 1 academic monograph, 6 articles in science and social science journals, 1 policy report in both English and Chinese, 1 regularly updated project website for public audiences and 2 international workshops.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>As is reflected in the Letters of Support, I maintain a continuous dialogue with people who work in the regulation of the life sciences China and in Europe. This project presents a much needed systematic examination on China's scientific accountability problem, which has not only complicated the prospects for global scientific application but also risks public well-being. The project is designed to promote responsible scientific research, improve good governance and inform best practice in research both in and with China. As such, the outcome of this project will be of importance to a range of users. 

There are 4 main groups on whom this research will impact, described below with examples of how the impact might occur (NB: * = have expressed clear interests as users and/or join the project Advisory Committee)

1) Regulators and research funders in both China and Europe
Example organisations: Ministry of Health (China)*, Ministry of Science and Technology (China)*, Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills (UK)*

The findings on the effectiveness of different regulatory devices in sustaining public trust in China will not only benefit China but help improve policy frameworks in other countries on research collaborations, public engagement and research protocols. Regulators and funders in both China and Europe will further benefit from a better understanding of what constitutes effective accountability and how to promote it. This will help regulators and funders in both China and Europe improve funding schemes and administrative procedures that take full advantage of transnational collaborations and cutting-edge innovations.

2) Transnational scientific societies
Examples: the Royal Society Science Policy Centre, Chinese Life Scientists Society in the UK*, International Society for Stem Cell Research

Scientific societies will receive better working knowledge of how research accountability is monitored in China and the effect of international scholarly exchange. This helps scientific societies to promote and enhance professional codes of conduct across national borders.

3) International civil society organisations

Special interest groups, such as patient advocacy groups (New Sunshine Foundation (China)*) and environmental NGOs (Nature University (China)*, China Dialogue (UK)): This project will not only organise events that promote knowledge exchange between interest groups with policy and scientific communities, it also involve civil society members in the co-production of alternative ways to protect patients and consumer rights.

Civil society organisations that aim to promote responsible innovation (e.g. Sense about Science (UK)*, NESTA (UK), the International Council for the Life Sciences (USA)*) will benefit from a clearer picture of the accountability problem and how it is dealt with in China. This will improve their public campaigns and policy engagements.

4) Hospitals and biotechnology enterprises: 
This project will raise social accountability awareness among the expanding number of hospitals and enterprises in both China and Europe that are promoting the application of biotechnology innovation. Currently the UK leads Europe in biotechnology investments (Ernst &amp;amp; Young, 2013, 52). In 2013, the UK Department of Health pledged an additional &amp;pound;4 million investment in NHS stem cell services (DOH, 2013). In this context, the findings on different social interpretations of scientific risk and regulatory change will inform their research and development (R&amp;amp;D) strategies, service provisions and product marketing.

Collaboration with users is an integral part of this research. Throughout the project, I will engage with different users in four main pathways (see Pathways to Impact for full details): 1) Sustained public engagement and knowledge sharing; 2) Co-organisation of research activities; 3) Wide involvement in refining research findings; and 4) Comprehensive user-appropriate publication plan.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-18</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-19</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>232136</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>China, People's Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Expert Consultant to improve China's scientific governance</gtr:description><gtr:id>C05FAE98-5B4B-49B6-945A-24369A8A350D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>One of the expected policy outcome is to submit a policy recommendation to MOST on improving codes of conduct in science governance.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56b9b9b88b6901.95873778-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The partner team at MOST builds fieldwork contacts, facilitates interview, designs and carries out the national survey.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>I am acting as the 'Expert Consultant' for the project 'Survey on Scientific Workers' Awareness of Research Ethics', commissioned by the China Association for Science and Technology. 

For this project, I work with China's Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST)'s research team. My main task has been helping them to design and carry out a small sample interview in three cities. This qualitative data forms the basis of their national survey on research ethics. Currently, we are still processing the survey data.

Extensive fieldwork from this ESRC study has found that in contrast to China's increasing research power, the public engagement of science remains at a nascent stage. Although there is good will from both scientific practitioners and civil society groups, as well as heavy investment from the Chinese government, a key hindrance for (re)building trust and accountability of science in China is a lack of public engagement skills amongst scientists and civic practitioners. The event brings together 50 delegates from China's Ministry of Science's research arm, Chinese Academy of Science and Technology for Development, life scientists from Beijing, Xi'an, Hangzhou and Wuhan, civil society representatives from Beijing, Xi'an, Wuhan and Chengdu, leading bioethicists, journalists, public engagement professionals from UK based institutions such as National Coordinating Centre for Public Engagement and Sense about Science. It provides capacity building on engagement skills; and identifies a roadmap for future public engagement that is pertinent to Chinese particularities. 

The workshop's immediate impact is it enhances China's scientific accountability to both domestic and international audiences through 1) exploring both the failures and successes of existing public engagement avenues and 2) providing capacity building on engagement skills. Its long-term impact is that this workshop initiates the coming together of a multi-stakeholder consortium which identifies and moderates a roadmap for future public engagement that is pertinent to Chinese particularities.

This workshop has received wide international media attention, ranging from China's official newspaper, People's Daily (Overseas Edition) and the supplement publication of Nature, Nature Index</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b9408e2d86a4.88052387</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Blog on GM Debates in China</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2B3BA0F5-9311-47CF-AC93-A6A0B470A81B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited contribution to 'China Policy Institute: Analysis' blogsite.
