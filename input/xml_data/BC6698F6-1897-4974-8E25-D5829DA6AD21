The book sets out to explore prose fiction in the period of the Roman Empire (first to fourth centuries C.E.). Ancient novels, which were among the greatest experiments in prose fiction from Greek and Roman antiquity flourished in this period. However, no ancient treatise survives which discusses the nature of fiction or the genre of the novel. This lack of any explicit theory means that there is a critical gap in our understanding of fiction in antiquity. \nThe book comprises five chapters, each of which examines the relationship between the world of the fiction and the world of the reader from a different perspective. The first chapter explores different ways in which these narratives are preoccupied, metafictionally, with the experience of fiction itself, analysing the language and imagery that are used to describe the reader's experience of the transition from the real to a fictitious world. The analysis expands our understanding of how ancient readers and writers conceptualized the experience of reading fiction. The second chapter examines the ways in which novels of this period dramatize their own protocols and establish templates for their genre by staging fictions of reading in their prologues. These prologues are crucial passages of implied theory about ancient approaches to reading fiction. The third chapter examines how fictions dramatize the reader's encounter with the material text - the scroll or book itself. This chapter offers original insight into some of the ways in which ancient fiction interacts with the wider contemporary written culture, the world of texts, papyrus, ink and the written word. The fourth chapter explores pseudo-documentary fiction. Here, the world of the fiction encroaches into the world of the reader by feigning to present authentic texts belonging to the reader's world. These texts are particularly revealing case-studies for the interaction between the world of the reader and the world of the book; their deliberate blurring of the boundaries which separate the two provokes questions about how readers distinguish 'fact' from 'fiction'. \nThe fifth chapter focuses on Lucian's True Stories as a case-study in the competitive jockeying for authority between the real world of the reader and the fantasy world of the fiction. Here the blurring-of-boundaries between the two worlds is pushed to extremes. The author, paradoxically, insists on the truthfulness of a narrative which he admits cannot be true. The explicitly false world of the book therefore challenges the authority of the reader's reality. This paradox is designed to place the reader in a dilemma, which highlights the paradoxical nature of fiction itself - an experience where the reader willingly accepts claims which (s)he knows are not true.\nThe key aims of this research are to illuminate literary critical thought about fiction in the ancient world through the analysis of the fictional texts themselves. The scholarly context for this project is formed by two very active areas of current scholarship: on ancient fiction, and on the literary and intellectual culture of the Roman empire. The book aims to contribute to this scholarly activity by examining the complex dialogue between the expanding genre of fictional narratives and the intellectual and cultural context inhabited by their authors and readers. It thus aims to illuminate how fictitious narratives were conceived, deployed and received in the Graeco-Roman world. Specifically the book also offers a distinctive new approach by exploring the dialogue between ancient prose fiction and contemporary written culture. This expands our understanding of the importance of the book as a cultural artefact in the ancient reader's imagination.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>One of the aims of this research is to engage the general public with the literary culture of the ancient Greek and Roman past, specifically to raise awareness of ancient parallels for the modern popular fascination with the pseudo-authentic. The book explores parallels between the deliberate blurring of 'fact' and 'fiction' in ancient literary practices, and the modern taste for pseudo-authenticity which has ensured the overwhelming popularity of blockbuster novels and films which similarly assume the guise of 'genuine' reports or 'true' stories, for example Dan Brown's *The Da Vinci Code*, Umberto Eco's *The Name of the Rose*, and the film *The Blair Witch Project* which was directed by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez (1999). This category of the pseudo-authentic in modern culture also includes television genres such as the docu-drama (e.g. *Culloden,* directed by Peter Watkins, 1964) and the spoof documentary (e.g. *Brass Eye,* Channel 4, 1997-2001). Texts, films and television programmes such as these tread a fine line between reality and fiction. As modern readers in a media-saturated culture, we have become increasingly aware of the power of the media to affect our understanding of world events. Whilst this awareness has made us more sophisticated - and potentially more sceptical - as readers and consumers of information, it has also cultivated in us an increased relish for representations of pseudo-reality, where fiction masquerades persuasively as fact, and the illusion of authenticity is central to our entertainment.\nBy exploring such overlaps between the world of the reader and the world of fiction in ancient literature, my research highlights possible connections between the postclassical culture of the Greek and Roman world and the postmodern culture of the western world. One potential impact of this research is to contribute to the general public's knowledge of ancient literary culture and understanding of its relevance to modern culture, and through fostering this understanding, to enhance the quality of intellectual life.\n\nI have planned the following pathways to enhance the impact of this research by disseminating it among non-academic users:\n\n1) submission of an article about ancient literary hoaxes, 'The Trojan war diaries,' to the sixth-form Classics journal *Omnibus*. This peer-reviewed journal is aimed at teachers and A-level students of Classical Studies, Ancient History, Greek and Latin. The purpose of the article will be to cultivate awareness among second-level students and teachers of texts such as the Trojan war diaries of Dictys and Dares and The Trojan oration of Dio Chrysostom, which are seldom read by school students, and to enhance understanding of the parallels between ancient and modern pseudo-documentary fiction, and between ancient and modern literary hoaxes.\n\n2) presentation of a paper about ancient literary hoaxes to the local branch of the Classical Association, which is attended by members of the general public.\n\n3) organisation of a panel of papers on the subject of ancient frauds and forgeries at the annual general conference of the Classical Association in Exeter in April 2012. This major conference is attended by members of the general public and school teachers, as well as members of the academic community.\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>18361</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>I have discovered connections between technical and fictional writing in ancient literature, which had previously been unexamined.
