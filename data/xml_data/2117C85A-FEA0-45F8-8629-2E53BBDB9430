In REF 14 the University of Brighton was ranked 27th for Impact, and the university's approach to engaging with communities and the public underpinned this success. There has been consistent support for our Community University Partnership Programme (CUPP, https://www.brighton.ac.uk/business-services/community-partnerships/index.aspx) and its innovative and successful approach to partnership working via the investment of infrastructure and expertise. An established access and brokerage point is available for communities via CUPP's Helpdesk, which sparks new ideas and possibilities and turns these into emergent partnership activities. We have established mechanisms for developing new successful partnerships through 14 years of a CUPP run seed funding programme. We have been the recipient of 2 major investments from HEFCE: The Brighton and Sussex Community Knowledge Exchange and South East Coastal Communities (involving 9 universities working with their communities, see evaluation report at http://www.coastalcommunities.org.uk/Sussex%20SECC%20final%20report.pdf) were both substantial programmes of community university engagement that gleaned considerable learning. 

However, a continual challenge for emergent work of this type is what happens with mature community university partnerships as a long term platform for Public Engagement with Research (PER). While there are a myriad of ways to keep good work going these are not always clearly articulated and supported. Additional pressure on such partnerships arise from internal tensions as academic staff balance PER with teaching and research and external challenges linked to the rapid external changes in UK Higher education. Some of the most successful partnerships involving the University of Brighton have become independent Social Enterprises and/or communities of practices (e.g. Boingboing - www.boingboing.org.uk) but many more partnerships exist in a hybrid state with different levels of ongoing connection with the university (e.g. Community 21, https://community21.org/). 

The aim of this PER project would be to address these challenges at Brighton and produce outputs and outcomes that will be of value to universities in the UK and internationally who face similar challenges of sustaining mature partnerships, whilst also addressing a rapidly changing higher education policy landscape and the tensions facing academics to deliver PER whilst producing high quality teaching and research.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research design is focussed on impact, and the co-designed and co-produced nature of the research activities will ensure impacts will be generated during and after the project. Impact pathways are integrated within the project's five objectives. These impacts will be strengthened as the project progresses into its dissemination phase. Working closely with NCCPE, our dissemination work will seek achieve national impacts with other HEIs. Our international connections give the prospect of international impacts. The involvement of community partners in the co-design and co-production of the project will ensure it is co-owned so that the impacts are valued by local communities, users and beneficiaries.

The vision is to:

* fully scope the challenge of how best PER partnerships can sustain themselves and develop a bespoke programme of support that can be maintained beyond the funded project that will benefit user groups(e.g. young people facing adversity, deprived neighbourhoods, LGBT, older people)

* development of the Community of Practice means impact is at the core of the project and this will deliver understanding of the challenges of the long term sustainability of PER partnerships. The process of cultivating the
Community of Practice will generate capacity building impacts amongst the partner beneficiaries including those working with disadvantage and vulnerable communities so that impact is generated throughout the project and beyond.

* generate wider impacts of the project via communicating with other academics and practitioners using social media. Existing UK and international social media networks will be extensively used to disseminate results, and equally lessons will be drawn from these networks to aid the planning and generation of impact

* establish a governance group at the University of Brighton to oversee the development of impactful PER partnerships that can generate impact in the long term</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>58902</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R019835/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
