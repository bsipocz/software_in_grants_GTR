Deregulation of ErbB receptors or their downstream targets underlie human pathologies ranging from developmental disorders to cancer. To date, we have learned a lot about the signalling cascades that are triggered upon receptor activation; however we know little about the negative regulatory mechanisms that attenuate, tune and specify signalling readout. By targeted deletion of the mig6 gene in mouse, we have shown that lack of Mig6 causes sustained EGF receptor and downstream MAPK activation leading to impaired keratinocyte differentiation and hyperproliferation (Ferby et al., Nat. Med., 2006). Proposed project seeks to provide insight into the underexplored mechanisms by which a growing family of multiadaptor feedback modulators contributes to the specification of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) mediated signalling during tissue development and homeostasis. The mechanism by which Mig6 negatively regulate EGF receptor signalling remains unclear and will be the topic of investigation. More specifically we have set up the following tree main objectives: a) We will aim at identifying direct effector molecules that are regulated by Mig6 and characterizing the relevance of these interactions for ErbB-mediated epidermal cellular responses. b) Furthermore, accumulating evidence suggest that Mig6 regulate the spacial distribution of the ErbB receptor family within the cell, which in turn emerges as a central determinant both of the specification and duration of RTK induced intracellular signalling. Therefore we will determine the role of Mig6 in regulating ErbB receptor trafficking and its impact on cellular responses. c) Finally, Mig6 is genetically related to the non-receptor tyrosine kinases Ack1 and Tnk1. Intriguingly both Ack1 and Tnk1 have also been implicated in negative regulation of ErbB receptor signalling and are co-expressed in epithelial tissues. These observations raise a possibility that Mig6 cooperates with Ack1 and Tnk1. We will therefore knock down either Ack1 or Tnk1 expression in mig6 knock-out keratinocytes and assess the possible synergistic effect on ErbB mediated cellular responses. Taken together, proposed research will provide novel insight into the mechanisms by which spatio-temporal control of ErbB receptor signalling is achieved and its importance for the regulation of epithelial cell differentiation and proliferation.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The growing number of identified negative feedback regulators of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) highlights the importance of signal attenuation and modulation for correct signalling outcome during embryonic development, tissue homeostasis and cancer. I have recently shown that deletion of the mouse mig6 gene, encoding a putative multi-adaptor RTK feedback inhibitor, causes sustained activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signalling through the MAPK pathway, which leads to overproliferation and impaired differentiation of keratinocytes (Nat. Med., 2006). The proposed project aims at clarifying the mechanisms by which the multiadaptor protein mitogen-induced gene-6 (Mig6) mediates spatio-temporal control of ErbB driven MAPK activation and epithelial cell differentiation. We will identify Mig6 interacting proteins in primary keratinocytes by an improved tandem affinity tag purification (TAP) protocol followed by identification by peptide mass fingerprinting. Verified candidate effectors will be investigated for their involvement in ErbB induced MAPK activation by gain and loss of function studies. Particular priority will be given to effectors potentially involved in trafficking of endocytic vesicles. Furthermore, increasing evidence are consistent with a role for Mig6 in the regulation of ErbB receptor trafficking. We will therefore demonstrate the role of Mig6 in regulating ErbB receptor trafficking, by assessing the effect of overexpression and deletion or knock-down of Mig6 on ErbB receptor dynamics and subcellular localisation. Subsequently we will investigate how Mig6 regulated receptor trafficking affects cellular responses (proliferation, differentiation, migration). Finally, the putative co-operative function of the genetically and functionally related Ack1, Tnk1 and Mig6 molecules in negative feedback control of ErbB signaling in epithelial cells will be investigated by RNAi knock-down of Ack1 and Tnk1 in mig6 knock-out cells.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>421275</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/F014848/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
