The question of what structure schools should have (comprehensive, private, selective, Academy etc) is only addressed within this debate about educational outcomes.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This proposed research asks: is the value of schooling identical with the value of education? If not, what is the basis of the value of schools separate from the education they provide, and are children owed a particular structure of school as a matter of social justice? This research considers schools as institutions that serve the needs of children as fellow members of a political community. Research into this political conception of childhood and of schools will include examination of the notion of child-citizenship, votes for children, and schools as institutional that protect child-citizens from inequalities with adults. The aim of this research is to develop principles of social justice that apply to the structure of schools, distinct from those that apply to the provision of education. These principles of the just school will address an important omission in the political theory literature and be valuable to stakeholders in policy debates on schooling, including professional organisations, think-tanks, government, and parents. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>22405</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Public Debate with Policy Stakeholders (London)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EA0CD1BA-84A4-44A4-ADB3-C0877B2AB543</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was a public debate organised by the University of Leicester to promote my research based on the Grant. The University invited policy stakeholders to join the panel with me, and also members of the public and policy professionals to join the audience. There was a lively debate among the panel members and audience. This debate was facilitated by online media such as Twitter, and video recordings of the event, interviews with the panel members. The debate continued online in the official event blogs and I continued to engage with various members of the public and policy stakeholders in this medium. These debates become quite intensive and stimulated contributions from campaign groups opposed to my views and research findings. These various activities and recordings of the event are hosted as part of the Leicester Exchanges website as an ongoing and accessible record of the occasion.

The main impacts were the stimulation of debate and discussion/disagreement around my research. This event brought together a wide range of policy stakeholders and also members of the public and then led subsequently to a wide range of further impact/engagement activities that I describe briefly below, and in more detail in separate entries.

An important outcome of the event for me was to be invited to participate in a range of further activities with London Citizen Schools and also the IPPR and Fabian Society think tanks. 

I was invited to participate in a number of events with the London Citizen Schools organisation. They work with children in schools to promote active citizenship in children. I visited Prendergast School, Ladywell, London, and spoke at an event with Melissa Benn and Clyde Chitty to a group of children and teachers about citizenship and social justice. 

This in turn led to involvement with a group of researchers and activists involved with other schools that are engaged in active citizenship. I became involved in a research project with a group of schools (Nower Hill London, St. Clere's Cooperative School Thurrock, RSA Academy Tipton and Prendergast London) that considered how to promote active citizenship and social justice in children. This included a further workshop with IPPR researchers, RSA researchers, and children and teachers from these schools held at the IPPIR on this topic. This fed into the final report of the group 'Citizen Schools: Learning to Rebuild Democracy' http://www.ippr.org/publications/citizen-schools-learning-to-rebuild-democracy 
Many of the themes of my research around schooling and social justice, and particularly the importance of giving children a democratic voice (based on the published output from the grant) fed into this report through this collaboration with the schools and think tank researchers, and so I consider this an associated impact from the Grant.
I was subsequently invited to participate in a Fabian Society Youth Event where I presented and discussed my research into child-suffrage and active citizenship.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5463f035e7a926.50656560</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://leicesterexchanges.com/2011/09/07/live-event-comprehensive-school-education-%E2%80%93-policy-mistake-lost-ideal-or-model-for-the-future/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2011</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop at IPPR with Schools and Think Tank Workers (London)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B85BB76E-E37B-496F-A64E-79F01F0408AE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was a workshop held at the IPPR with children and teachers from four schools: Nower Hill London, Prendergast London, RSA Academy Tipton; and St. Clere's Thurrock, in addition to policy researchers from the IPPR. We discussed collaboration on a shared project called 'Citizen Schools' that was in part derived from my research which was disseminated through the Leicester Exchanges event. We shared experiences about promoting active child citizenship, and discussed proposals for promoting this in School policy. This led to further collaboration and ultimately a pamphlet that I was involved with called 'Citizen Schools: Learning to Rebuild Democracy' published by the IPPR . There was a lively and inclusive debate between all participants at the workshop including teachers and children, and many ideas for promoting active youth citizenship were shared and discussed with regular contributions from me about how these practical ideas fit into my wider theoretical research

One of the main impacts came in the form of an eventual pamphlet that was derived from this team of participants which had policy proposals submitted to the Labour Party Policy review on Education. But perhaps more importantly, these activities promoted an active engagement between schools around sharing ideas and policies on developing active child citizenship. I was involved as a facilitator and contributor to these discussions, and I tried to contribute at appropriate points results and implications of my research, but it was a collaborative venture where the impact was derived from the various participants working cooperatively. The original spur for this project was my Leicester Exchanges event and the relationships and impact that had (the Leicester Exchanges event is recorded separately).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5463f6ac094ab5.23244975</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ippr.org/publications/citizen-schools-learning-to-rebuild-democracy</gtr:url><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Participation in Young Fabians Debate</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>93D13229-5CAE-49B1-90F7-FDB9E00C7A6D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I participated in a debate around children's active citizenship with the Young Fabians. The debate focused on my work on child-suffrage and there was much questioning and discussion of my arguments and research.

Several of the participants in this debate were very interested in my work and later became involved in the IPPR Citizen Schools project with which I was involved, in large part through the stimulation provided by this Young Fabians Event.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5463fd86df76c3.52259467</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Blog Post</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1E9FFA26-0661-4288-BC0F-42B86F7406A5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was a short blog post written during the collaborative work I was conducting with the IPPR/Citizen Schools project team, that was ultimately derived from my Leicester Exchanges event in 2011.

I was part of a team of speakers, which included Melissa Benn and Clyde Chitty, and we visited a class with around 15 children, discussed their work, were introduced to the work of London Citizen Schools, and then held a discussion where I briefly talked about my research on social justice and active citizenship for children. The main results were building mutual understanding between me and the London Citizen Schools organisation about areas of shared interest in active youth citizenship; presenting the main themes from my research; promoting active citizenship and endorsing the work of London Citizen Schools as complimentary to the results of my research around child-citizenship.

After my visit I was invited to be involved in further activities with the London Citizen Schools team, including a workshop in the IPPR involving a wider collection of schools, children, and think-tank workers (I mentioned this event in as part of the outcome of the Leicester Exchanges event).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5463f35735e4c5.85927685</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2011</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The most important outcome from the research to date has been a new basis for justifying the abolition of a minimum voting age and allowing all minimally qualified children to vote, regardless of their age. The main arguments of my paper 'Against a Minimum Voting Age' set out the moral and theoretical arguments for this position, and develop feasible policy implications of these arguments. The main suggestions are replacing a minimum voting age with individual tests of minimal competence in the form of a test for basic literacy (self-completion of a simple voter registration form); and minimum independent to cast a personal vote (a private ballot).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The main scientific output to date has concerned my argument for abolishing the minimum voting age and replacing it with an individual procedural test for minimum electoral competence. I am optimistic that this work can have direct impact on the growing debate around the voting age, particularly following the involvement of 16 and 17 year-olds in the Scottish Referendum. I am actively seeking both academic and policy partners to develop this work further and seek meaningful impact in the impending debate around these important social, political and moral questions.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D998A06C-517B-42A1-8056-6342AF0325C2</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54640257be4811.90257419</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2D4C93E4-301E-401E-8A59-56D1BB413FBD</gtr:id><gtr:title>Against a minimum voting age</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Critical Review of International Social and Political Philosophy</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/1256735e25b08861787e9cac6d607c99"><gtr:id>1256735e25b08861787e9cac6d607c99</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cook P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5463eabc020115.05251558</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B4049C11-6E96-4E34-9D21-D34C8438BB54</gtr:id><gtr:title>Co-operative Schools: a democratic alternative</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>FORUM</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/91960632c7f00600a3b327f425665fb0"><gtr:id>91960632c7f00600a3b327f425665fb0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>AUDSLEY J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5463fab41dcd77.74483960</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-000-22-3228</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/G026750/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F7EEE6CD-E283-4BAB-BA5E-70B4B0F1F1A6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
