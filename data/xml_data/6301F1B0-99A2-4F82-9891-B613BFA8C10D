This is a process of more damage to brain tissue that occurs over a number of hours and days after the original event. Currently, there is little we can do to restore normal working in brain regions that have been damaged beyond repair by the initial trauma or stroke. However, we might be able to prevent secondary brain injury if we were able to detect this as it progresses.
After an injury, a region of vulnerable but still potentially viable brain tissue is established around the injury core. This is the region that is susceptible to secondary brain injury and is called the 'penumbra'. We now know that electrical brain waves, called &amp;quot;spreading depolarisations&amp;quot; (SD), frequently occur in the penumbra after an injury. We believe a special class of these SDs to be very harmful and to contribute significantly to the process of secondary injury. However, there is another group of SDs that bring with them an extra supply of oxygen and glucose. This can be very beneficial to the neurons in the penumbra in helping them to recover. As such, whilst we would like to prevent SDs that are harmful, we do not want to prevent those that might be favourable. The problem is, we currently have no way of telling the difference between them. One way we might be able to tell the difference though is to examine the effect they have on the health of the neurons.
Over the last few years I have worked to develop a method to probe neuronal health and to monitor changes in the viability of the neurons in real-time. Now I would like to use this method to characterise the changes that indicate declining neuronal viability. This would enable us to see secondary brain injury happening live at the patient's bedside, giving us a much better opportunity to intervene before it is too late. I would also like to use this method to identify which SDs are causing harm to the neurons and which ones are potentially helping them recover. This would mean that we could personalise treatments for patients experiencing harmful SDs.
Furthermore, because even just one harmful SD will likely damage or kill neurons in the penumbra we would ideally like to prevent them from happening at all. This would mean though, that we would have to identify the changes that make neurons vulnerable only to harmful SDs. Luckily, we know from pre-clinical experiments that there are some very specific changes in the tissue environment that predispose neurons to harmful SD. Importantly, these changes are not seen before those that might be beneficial.
As a part of the work I have done in developing a method to probe neuronal health, I have also established a way of assessing changes in the tissue environment that predispose neurons to harmful SDs. I would like to use this method to see if I can predict which patients are likely to begin having harmful SDs. This would mean that in the future, instead of waiting for them to start we could give pre-emptive treatments to susceptible patients.
Finally, in order to actively prevent secondary brain injury, we need to know both when neuronal health is in decline and also what treatments are effective in improving this. By continuously tracking neuronal health status in real-time I aim to provide physicians with an online bedside tool that will both identify declining health and provide immediate feedback on the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions. The implementation of such a tool into clinical practice has the potential to limit the amount of secondary brain damage that occurs after an injury and thereby to significantly improve the outcome of the patients.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Aims: 1) To identify excitability profiles of membrane depolarisation and hyperpolarisation as a surrogate marker of neuronal health following acquired brain injury. 2) To ascertain the effect of spreading depolarisations (SD) on the viability of neurons. 3) To identify excitability profiles that predict harmful SDs 4) To characterise the excitability profiles associated with systemic variables, intracerebral variables and clinical interventions.
Methods: Twenty-five brain injured adults will be recruited. Intraparenchymal and subdural platinum electrode arrays (Ad-Tech, USA) will be placed in penumbral tissue at conclusion of emergency surgery. Subdural electrodes will be used to identify spreading depolarisations and intraparenchymal electrodes to record Compound Bundle Action Potential (CBAP) responses.
CBAPs will be acquired using Qtrac (Inst. of Neurology) to control delivery of stimuli via a stimulator (DS5; Digitimer, UK). Parameters will be kept within safe limits.
Stimulus-response: A CBAP of target amplitude (TA) will be set by recording a stimulus-response curve. Stimulus required to evoke TA is referred to as 'absolute threshold'.
Absolute Threshold will be tracked by automatically adjusting stimulus intensity up or down depending on whether a recent CBAP was lessor or greater than TA.
Recovery Cycle of excitability (RC) will be obtained by comparing absolute threshold with the stimulus required to evoke TA after a sequence of afterpotentials have been set in motion by a previous stimulus given at a series of interstimulus intervals (ISI).
The superexcitable and late subexcitability phase of the RC will be tracked by cyclically delivering stimuli (0.2Hz) with an ISI of 20ms and 100ms, respectively.
Opportunities: Real-time detection of changing neuronal health status provides a unique opportunity to limit the amount of secondary damage that occurs after an acute brain injury, thereby greatly improving patient outcome.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>1.The international CoOperative Studies on Brain Injury Depolarisations (COSBID) consortium:
Among the different research interest of COSBID, whether it is possible to determine which spreading depolarisations (SD) are harmful and which may be considered innocuous is one of the most important. Drugs that are able to prevent SD are already available but no formal clinical study has been conducted yet because this question remains unanswered. At the most recent COSBID meeting in Alburquerque, NM, USA, in July 2016 this problem was discussed at length and it is set to be the primary discussion point at the next meeting in Berlin in March 2017.
2.International Brain Trauma Foundation Guidelines:
In response to the significant societal issue of secondary brain injury, the Brain Trauma Foundation (BTF) issued treatment guidelines for management of severe head injury. Studies have shown that implementation of the BTF guidelines improves efficiency and outcomes for patients. This has led to harmonisation on agreed treatment and has influenced treatment protocols worldwide. 
Patients that have been admitted to an ICU with a brain injury are typically taken through a series of ascending therapies in order to limit secondary brain injury. This process can be formalised into the treatment algorithm. Currently, measurement of intracranial pressure (ICP) is the cornerstone of monitoring injury progression injury. Unfortunately, ICP has a number of severe shortcomings, primarily that it provides only an indirect measure of the health of penumbral tissue. Moreover, it only monitors established deterioration and its use has not been shown to improve outcome. Therefore, the BTF encourages the development of additional neuromonitoring modalities. The development of excitability tracking in severe brain injury will represent a unique opportunity to improve patient outcome by providing clinicians with a tool that will 1) identify secondary brain injury in progress and 2) guide early interventions aimed at preventing secondary injury. Excitability tracking has the potential to become a monitoring modality central to management alongside ICP. I expect it will eventually be adopted into the BTF.
3.The medical device industry:
Medical device companies are in constant search of new innovative, products that have the potential to improve outcomes and reduce cost, fulfilling the ubiquitous mantra of &amp;quot;doing more for less&amp;quot;. Excitability tracking can be applied to monitor neuronal viability at the patient's bedside. There currently exists no other means to achieve this. The number of patients who would potentially benefit from real-time neuronal monitoring for prevention of secondary deterioration is comparable to that currently receiving ICP monitoring which is in the order of 1 million patients a year. I expect excitability tracking to present an interesting opportunity for the medical device industry.
4.The pharmaceutical industry:
As an example, excitability tracking techniques are being used in studies of peripherally acting drugs in conditions such as neuropathic pain and motor neuron disease. Recently, the European Medicines Agency issued scientific qualification advice on the use of nerve excitability as a biomarker in clinical trials for neuropathic pain prompting for more studies to be performed using this technique. Correspondingly, pilot results so far indicate that interventions of various kinds produce profound changes in neuronal excitability in the injured human brain. Therefore, I believe that excitability testing in the brain could similarly be used as a tool to monitor the effects of central nervous system (CNS) acting agents, both preclinically and clinically. I anticipate the pharmaceutical industry will be highly interested in using this technique as a biomarker both for target engagement and for efficacy studies in the development of CNS acting drugs.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>235797</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/R00112X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
