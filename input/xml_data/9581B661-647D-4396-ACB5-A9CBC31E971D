Recent criticism of Shakespeare tends to occlude the fact that Elizabethan society was predominantly agrarian, and that much of its social and political language emerged from the moral management and cultivation of the land. However, Shakespeare consistently draws on the language of husbandry at crucial moments in many of his plays. He appropriates and redefines its contemporary language, creating new terms relating to husbandry, many of which he never uses again, in the process of developing the social fabric of his dramatic worlds. To 'improve', 'cultivate', 'manage', 'enclose', and 'possess' are all terms that describe practices of land management and animal husbandry. They are also terms that reflect dominant social values (moral, political and ethical), and describe a variety of ways in which early modern individuals understood and related to each other. This project analyses a range of Shakespearean representations of husbandry: household management in 'The Taming of the Shrew'; the place and metaphor of the garden in 'Richard II'; the war-torn fields of home and abroad in 'Henry V'; the symbolism of governance in 'Henry VI' and the court of 'Hamlet'; Macbeth's cosmos, and the fields and farms of 'The Tempest' and 'Pericles'. For Shakespeare, the language of husbandry persistently mediates the ways in which a range of social processes are understood and represented on the stage.\n \nThe research context for this project is the significant but critically neglected rise of the husbandry manual in sixteenth century England. Although early modern historians have addressed the broader social significance of writing on husbandry there is virtually no corresponding analysis of the ways in which the language and debates surrounding husbandry are expressed and performed in the literature and, in particular the drama, of the period. My research will analyse a culture that uses husbandry to develop a new social language and practice of social control, as well as profit. It is a language that aims to manage even as it reaps. A peculiarly English phenomenon, the use of agricultural metaphors for the expressions of control and creation begin to appear as the result of sixteenth and seventeenth-century developments in travel, farming, private ownership, and economics, all of which will be surveyed in this project. This agricultural language offers the actions of husbandry as practices and metaphors for a new world, not just of discovery but also of social, political and philosophical values. The language used ranges across the agrarian but also implicitly social and political metaphors of 'cultivation', 'improvement', 'replenishing', 'subduing' and 'enclosing'. The primary objective of this project is to explain how these terms are translated, tested, and modified on Shakespeare's stage. Drawing on recent historical and critical research on enclosure and colonisation through the metaphors of the land and the garden, the research will argue that Shakespeare explores husbandry in terms that are both morally and ethically under negotiation. He dramatises some of the major concerns of the Elizabethan period through the perspective of agrarian cultivation: from nationalism and colonisation, social status and rank to cross-breeding and economic individualism, Shakespeare's dramatic language of husbandry reflects but also shapes social values and the meaning of community in the predominantly rural early modern community.\n \nLiterary criticism has recently taken an ecological turn, but most of this work has focussed on post-17th century literature. Drawing on the social and ecological environment of Shakespeare's work, this project will bring ideas of nature and culture back into dialogue with each other, to produce a more complex vision of Shakespeare's nature.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The impact of the research will be of immediate benefit to the scholarly community of academics working across a range of disciplines because of its interdisciplinary nature. These will include: English Language and Literature, History, Geography, Drama and Theatre Studies. It will provide academics working in later periods to understand the historical development of the representation of the natural world within literature through the iconic figure of Shakespeare. Specific plans for distribution and dissemination to its academic audience involve:\n\n* Communicating excellence and innovation in research and developing new approaches to Shakespeare by presenting the work to internationally and nationally recognised academic audiences: the Shakespeare Association of America; the World Shakespeare Congress; the London Shakespeare Seminar; the Shakespeare Institute seminar; the London Group of Historical Geographers.\n\nThe research will also have direct benefit for a range of Shakespeare teachers and students at a variety of levels, from undergraduate to postgraduate researchers. Specific plans for dissemination include:\n\n* Undergraduate teaching: the research will be incorporated into core Shakespeare teaching at undergraduate level. It will also be central to a new 'pathway' option course for final-year students, encouraging them to broaden their critical understanding of Shakespeare, and stimulate further research based on the content and methodology of the outputs.\n* Graduate teaching: encouraging innovative research at MA and PhD level into this aspect of Shakespeare through set work related to this research, as well as primary sources on husbandry. \n\nThe research will have a direct impact on beneficiaries working within the theatre and within the public arena. Impacts will include:\n\n* Developing established institutional links with the Globe Theatre, London: giving public lectures, and addressing students on the Kings/Globe MA in Shakespeare Studies, the Globe's theatre practitioners on my research, and Queen Mary's QUORUM seminar.\n* Public talks at literary festivals (Hay-on-Wye, Cheltenham, Edinburgh).\n* Collaborative workshops on my subject based on continued work with Bill Alexander, RSC Associate Director (see Pathways to Impact).\n\nA more speculative potential impact within the wider public arena is through the media. Having contributed to a BBC Radio 3 documentary on Shakespeare in 2007 (producer Mark Rickards), I would investigate dissemination through features and articles on the popular subject of Shakespeare and Nature.\n\nThe relevance of such research to these beneficiaries is extremely wide-ranging andwill include:\n\n* Encouraging new and innovative approaches to Shakespeare. The plans for dissemination described above will have significant national and international visibility in both the academic and student community. It will foster increased dialogue on the subject between scholars in the field, and challenge students' established assumptions about Shakespeare. \n* Stimulating creative approaches to Shakespeare. Interaction with theatre practice will encourage new approaches to the performance of key scenes and particular themes as addressed in the research outputs.\n* Developing public understanding of Shakespeare. The research will enable students and general readers to consider and reflect on changing literary perceptions of the landscape and its management at a time of increasing public and political awareness of such issues.\n* Shaping cultural identity. Although the research's impact on public policy may be initially limited, its diverse dissemination will stimulate a greater awareness of agrarian life and labour. Prevailing Shakespeare criticism tends to focus on metropolitan issues (urban space, capital and social mobility), but this research aims to provide new insights into contemporar</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-06-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>58208</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A film celebrating the power of story in Shakespeare's work</gtr:description><gtr:id>9DEC4EE3-823C-411D-9DF1-ED65FC634FF1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>international reach</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cb6928bf0e64.65619825</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Shakespeare Lives</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A film made for Oxford University Press about nature in Shakespeare</gtr:description><gtr:id>FEB6FF0B-8CF8-431A-A6A8-85616F05D760</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Wide outreach and linking interdisciplinary subjects through media</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cd7c65f00aa3.85033310</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Video</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>An touring exhibition of maps from Michael Drayton's poem, and a number of outreach projects associated with it.</gtr:description><gtr:id>FA6810F1-3580-4789-8A3D-5C5F3FD32816</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Outreach to schools, colleges and children with autism as well as widening participation</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cb68bb1ba052.31137680</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>The Poly-Olbion Project</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Public event</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AF4CA694-09CA-4FA4-9334-82F9595D0289</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This event was organised by me in association with The National Trust and The Birthplace Trust, to explore Shakespeare within the context of historic Warwickshire and certain biographical issues.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bfe0635bc911.00274006</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Video</gtr:description><gtr:form>A broadcast e.g. TV/radio/film/podcast (other than news/press)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8D7FCCBD-4137-4FD7-8840-4132B3E95C8A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A video aimed at engaging with the general public as well as students of literature.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bfddde42d429.77983920</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEsSFEgYPc8&amp;t=1s</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Public Lecture/workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B927DAA3-5BBB-46F8-B8E5-1AEA40A5C239</gtr:id><gtr:impact>over 100 people attended a pre-performance talk, which sparked discussion and debate</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cb680ab46144.83221364</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2012,2013,2014,2015,2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Video</gtr:description><gtr:form>A broadcast e.g. TV/radio/film/podcast (other than news/press)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1CF96153-B132-44FF-B92A-14A9CB7C5723</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This video is aimed at engaging wider audiences with the relationships between Shakespeare and culture.
