&lt;p>Subjects to be explored include: &lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>the allocation of labour time among waged work, self-provisioning and work in the home;&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>how this allocation varied by age and gender; how children's time was mobilised; &lt;/li>

 &lt;li>if the household's external relationships influenced its internal organisation; &lt;/li>

 &lt;li>whether market work was driven by consumption aspirations or the need to defend standards; what particular goods were desired;&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>whether marriage typically required the accumulation of a standard set of goods. &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>A further issue concerns how families came to decisions on these matters. Was this democratic? Or did husbands dominate wives and parents rule children? Since these questions relate to family relationships, they are difficult to answer using standard sources.&amp;nbsp;The autobiographies provide a rare historical window into humble homes and rich commentary on families' economic strategies.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The methodology combines quantitative and qualitative information from the autobiographies to recapture and understand how families responded to both the opportunities and the pressures of industrialisation. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>195666</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The Children Who Built Victorian Britain - Documentary</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EB3BFBA0-B701-426D-80EB-D81DBD17BB82</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Documentary for BBC 4. Presented and co-wrote. Aired in February and August 2011.

The programme's significance was recognised at the International History Makers festival in New York, January 2012, where it won the award for the best history programme. 
The programme also led to invitations to speak at literary festivals, and museums, as well as to policy makers concerned with child labour, social care, and family policy. For example, the project's success in bringing economic history to life resulted in invitations to speak to audiences of curators and conservators, (&amp;quot;Home</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-3783243348.6201272b573e5e</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Media (as a channel to the public)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87eVOpbcoVo</gtr:url><gtr:year>2011</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>McArthur Lectures</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8931796B-1BC9-4B07-AA17-7029DE941CF9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Four lectures on gendering economic history which have been podcasted and will be available on Cambridge University and the Economic History Society websites. Lecture 1 covered history of women's wages and work from the Black Death to the industrial revolution. Lecture 2 focused on hand-spinners and their wages and the catastrophic loss of income caused by precipitous mechanisation. Lecture 3 concerned women and girls' experiences of the economic changes associated with industrialisation including their age of starting work, schooling duration and sex segregation in employment. Lecture 4 revisited the debate about the rise of the male breadwinner family, drawing together themes raised in the earlier lectures and relating these to power dynamics, tensions and the distribution of resources within the household. The lectures will be published by CUP as a monograph.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56ded152671a52.96572117</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.hist.cam.ac.uk/events/the-ellen-mcarthur-lectures-2016</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>My project used the life accounts of men and women who lived through the industrial revolution to raise and address the experiential characteristics of industrial change. My approach makes economic history more accessible and grounded, ensuring that teachers, students, and members of the public see the past through the eyes of working people and think of industrialization, child labour and family life in new ways. This claim is substantiated by the response to my documentary The Children Who Built Victorian Britain, outlined below, but also seen in the reaction to my work through invitations to speak at literary festivals, and museums, as well as to policy makers concerned with child labour, social care, and family policy. For example, the project's success in bringing economic history to life resulted in invitations to speak to audiences of curators and conservators, (&amp;quot;Home: the idea and reality in working-class children's lives&amp;quot;, Children at Home Conference, Geffrye Museum, 18th March 2011), and groups of discerning albeit amateur historians (e.g. Local and Social History Day School on Child Labour, Oxford University, Continuing Education, May 2012 and Banbury Historical Society January 2017). Similarly, my argument that children were not mere victims but active agents for change has synergies with the work of Save the Children Canada's 'Children and Work Programme' and, after seeing it, officers of the organisation recruited me to its Advisory Board, to develop child-centred research initiatives aiming to include children's own voices in debates about child labour, schooling and the formation of human capital. Perhaps the strongest evidence of the research's impact is provided by the continued viewing and discussion of the documentary via YouTube as well as blog, email and postal correspondence elicited. YouTube versions have been watched by thousands of people. For example, the version accessible via http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87eVOpbcoVo has been viewed 386,614 times as of 3 March 2017. The programme is widely used in courses on history of the industrial revolution and history of childhood in universities, secondary schools and other educational institutions.</gtr:description><gtr:id>FE8D2AF5-B34E-456F-B19A-028729003CF8</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5460f2ed4fcfe0.01472015</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The life stories of men and women who lived through the industrial revolution answer questions about families' economic strategies: who worked and where; what did children do; were girls treated differently; did new goods motivate industriousness; and did marriage require prior saving? Furthermore, how did families come to their decisions? Were they democratic or did husbands dominate wives and parents rule children? These questions are not amenable to standard sources. Autobiographies provide a rare historical window into humble homes, yielding both quantitative and qualitative information, which together illuminate household decision-making. The 200 women's memoirs, which I have added to the men's autobiographies used in my prizewinning book, Childhood and Child Labour, illustrate female experience, enabling me to trace gender differences in schooling, diet, first jobs and age of starting work. Girls had less schooling, poorer diets, and often worked first as unpaid skivvies in family homes. While not uncaring of their girls, working-class families often subjugated their life chances to broader familial interests. Although women and girls did aspire to consume novel goods, basic needs more commonly motivated their industriousness. The loving mothers and distant fathers who featured in the men's autobiographies are replicated here. Indeed the mother-daughter relationship appears even stronger than the mother-son tie, reinforced by a shared maternal destiny. One striking finding is the frequency with which women recalled sexual predation: a hazard whose negotiation limited opportunities and constrained behaviour. Sadly, girls who grew up in state care were most at risk of exploitation.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Data arising from the grant has been deposited with the UK Data Service and will provide other scholars with new research capacity. The data has already been used by an Oxford University MSc student, Arthi Vellore, who included an analysis of the recorded schooling durations of boys and girls in her successful master's thesis on household allocation of resources. Ms Vellore is continuing work on the resource in her ongoing DPhil.

Outputs from the project employ a methodology which integrates quantitative and qualitative analysis as explained in my proposal and end of project report. This integrated approach breaks down the usual methodological opposition of quantitative and qualitative analyses and opens up new paths to empirical understanding. The benefits include bridging the traditional divide between economic historians trained in social science methodology and historians with their preference for narrative approaches. My innovative integrated methodology was praised by Joyce Burnette in her review of my (2010) book in Journal of Economic History September 2011 which opened with &amp;quot;While qualitative and quantitative approaches to history are sometimes set up as competitors, the two approaches are complimentary, and historians should use both if they want to fully understand the past. Jane Humphries' book does just that, wedding these two approaches in a way that will please both historians and economists&amp;quot;. I have developed this approach further during the project and it characterises both published outputs and work in progress. I also teach it as a specific research strategy in my advanced paper in Economic and Social History in the Oxford MSc/MPhil, &amp;quot;History from Below&amp;quot;, whose design and development was an integral part of the Professorial Fellowship and whose delivery was promised in the original proposal. This course is now being taught for its fourth year and student feedback is excellent. The course attracts students from Continuing Education as well as Economic and Social History. Students have applied the methods and approaches of the course to different national contexts. Currently I have a graduate student who is working on a comparative study of domestic service in Britain and France using servants' autobiographies from both countries.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>18D70196-C456-492E-903C-1768D13FEF94</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5460f42785f5a5.19764851</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>ED4D4DA6-F0F0-4D2D-A6EF-AF9013F8EA14</gtr:id><gtr:title>Off the Record: Reconstructing Women's Labor Force Participation in the European Past</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Feminist Economics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2a4aa6f94da0c467d2d6f8ece1304aaa"><gtr:id>2a4aa6f94da0c467d2d6f8ece1304aaa</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Humphries J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cf9bf9ba91d2d7</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0F6AEEC1-CD50-4804-ABBD-2AD792ADA52A</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Industrial Revolution.
