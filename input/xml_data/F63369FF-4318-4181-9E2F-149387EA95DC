These are important in a range of technologies, such as harvesting solar energy and data storage, as well as understanding photo-stability and deriving new molecules via photochemical pathways. This energy flow is complex, as a number of different pathways (channels) are available. Of particular importance are what are termed non-adiabatic pathways that allow a molecule to undergo a change of chemical character (electronic state) effectively instantaneously and so dominate the molecular evolution. Unfortunately it is impossible to say a priori which pathways are most important for a particular molecular, and computer simulations have a large role to play in answering this question by modelling the potential energy surfaces and molecular dynamics after excitation.

Computer codes for simulating excited-state dynamics are becoming more powerful and useful. However, there is still no code available that can capture all of the quantum mechanical effects required for the often large molecules of interest. The MCTDH package is one of the few codes that is able to treat these problems accurately in a general, user-friendly way. A development part of the code implements a novel method, the DD-vMCG algorithm. This promises to be able to accurately treat the molecules of interest using what is termed direct dynamics, which couples the dynamical simulation of the changes in molecular structure to a separate program that calculates the potential energy surfaces only when required, thus saving much of the work. Initial studies support this.

This DD-vMCG code has shown its potential in a number of studies. It now needs to be developed so that it is efficient, easy to use, and can be developed in a sustainable manner. The sustainable development of scientific software is crucial for it to survive and adapt as science progresses. The planned work will ensure that this method will be able to fulfill its potential after many years of development and be used by the scientific community to help understand and engineer how molecules behave and can ultimately be controlled in the presence of light.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>72660</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The goal of this research was to develop software for carrying out quantum molecular dynamics.

Understanding the energy flow in molecules after absorbing a photon of light is important to understand their light-activated properties.

Computer codes for simulating excited-state dynamics are becoming more powerful and useful. At the start of this project there was still no code available that could capture all of the quantum mechanical effects required for larger molecules, that had the potential to be used by non-specialist researchers. This promises to be able to accurately treat the molecules of interest using what is termed direct dynamics, which couples the dynamical simulation of the changes in molecular structure to a separate program that calculates the potential energy surfaces only when required, thus saving much of the work. Initial studies support this.

This DD-vMCG code - now available as part of the Quantics package - was developed through this award so that it is more computationally efficient, easier to use, more stable numerically, and can continue to be developed in a sustainable manner. This software engineering work ensures that the method will be able to fulfill its potential after many years of development, and can be used by the scientific community to help understand and engineer how molecules behave and ultimately how they can be controlled in the presence of light.

One recent example highlights the potential of the method for such applications in the future. In quantum theory, electrons behave like waves and can therefore interfere, as demonstrated in Young's double-slit experiment. The ability to interfere is related to the 'coherence' of the electron waves: as long as there exists a constant relative displacement between the different electron waves, the system is said to be coherent. However, the electrons are not isolated; their motion is affected by the motion of the nuclei in the molecule (even at absolute zero temperature). Is coherence long enough to be observed by experiment? By using Quantics to carry out dynamics calculations for both electrons and nuclei, researchers have been able to accurately describe this decoherence for the first time, and to show that for many molecules and many electronic states it is almost unavoidable.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>There was no quantum dynamics code available as part of the National Service for Computational Chemistry Software, the UK service run primarily for non-specialist computational chemists. Our long-term goal was to provide such a code, along with the experience to make use of it effective and an active community linking developers and users. As with electronic structure theory, the transition from specialist academic to non-specialist and non-academic use will take time. We cannot guarantee that our nonadiabatic dynamics code will change the way light-driven molecular devices are designed in 20 years time. We have, however, provided a code that, by analogy with electronic structure codes, shows non-specialists the types of calculations they could make and so generates new interest and ideas. NSCCS no longer exists, but the code developed as part of this project - Quantics - is available for specialists and non specialists, with an interest in accurately calculating the dynamical behaviour of multiple electronic states in molecules.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>2C265674-4028-4F93-8818-80676F9DBC4A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56cf5df79c23e4.98447858</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Energy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/naturalsciences/chemistry/newssummary/news_8-3-2017-10-57-39</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>The goal of this part of a joint research programme was to transform the MCTDH program for carrying out molecular quantum dynamics calculations, creating a stable new release accessible to a much wider range of researchers, through supporting an academic visitor with detailed knowledge of the methods implemented and a software consultant with database, revision control and code optimisation experience.</gtr:description><gtr:id>18F57838-CD3D-4D00-BFAA-0EEC71C7D8CA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Quantics code whose development was supported by this joint award is the closest now available to a general purpose software for molecular quantum dynamics, as well as being a specialised research tool.
