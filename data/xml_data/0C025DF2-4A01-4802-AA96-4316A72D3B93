Following TBI, patients can experience problems with their memory, attention span, and ability to process information. This is known as cognitive impairment and can cause people to lose their jobs and result in family breakdown. It poses an immense burden to the health of an individual, and also has large economic and social consequences to the NHS and the nation. 

Cognitive impairment following TBI is very variable. Approximately 25% of patients improve but an equal number deteriorate over time. We know very little about why people vary in how much the brain repairs itself following injury. Crucially, we have no treatments available to improve cognitive impairment and brain repair.

I have observed that a significant number of the patients with TBI we see in our clinic have a condition known as the Metabolic Syndrome (MetS). This syndrome consists of a cluster of problems which can occur together in the same individual including high blood pressure, high blood glucose, obesity, and high levels of fat and low levels of 'good' cholesterol in the blood. A person with MetS is at high risk of developing diabetes, heart attacks and strokes. Many people in the world have this condition due to the rise in obesity and increasingly unhealthy lifestyles.

I am attempting to show whether MetS hinders recovery from TBI. At first glance it may seem unlikely that problems in the body can also affect the way the nerves in the brain recover. However several experiments have already been done that show that diabetes, obesity and MetS may not only increase the risk for but also hinder recovery from other brain diseases such as stroke, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, and damage to nerves in arms and legs.

I predict that one of the reasons MetS may impair brain recovery due to increased brain inflammation. When we injure ourselves we automatically mount an inflammatory response to initiate the healing process. This can be helpful initially but if this process continues it can also be damaging. The MetS causes long-term inflammation in the body and therefore may also cause abnormal inflammation in the brain. 

The experiments I plan to carry out involve patients after TBI. I plan to compare equal numbers of patients with and without MetS in the months after their TBI. It will be possible to measure their cognitive impairment and well-being using validated computerised tests and questionnaires. 

I will also take pictures of their brains using novel imaging techniques called diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and positron emission tomography (PET). DTI enables us to look in detail at the connections between nerves throughout the brain. PET enables us to measure inflammation in the brain. 

The patients will have these tests and scans at two time points, one year apart, so that changes in the brain can be studied. Comparing the results between people with and without MetS will enable me to discover whether the MetS does indeed cause brain inflammation, and inhibit brain repair and recovery after TBI.

The outcomes from this study have the potential to help large numbers of people who are suffering from the effects of TBI. In our hospital alone we have seen over 300 new patients with TBI in our out-patient clinic over the last 3 years, and referrals from the Emergency Department continue to increase. There is little we can offer them in terms of treatment, leaving patients frustrated as well as living with long-term disability. However we estimate that up to a third of our patients have MetS. It is quite easy and cheap to treat aspects of the MetS with readily available medicines, as well as by improving diet and exercise. Therefore if I succeed in demonstrating that the common and treatable MetS hinders brain repair following TBI, thousands of people may benefit in the future.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common cause of disability but there are no current treatments that aid brain repair.

Objective: To investigate whether the frequently occurring metabolic syndrome impairs recovery from TBI.

Aims: To see if the presence of metabolic syndrome or insulin resistance in patients after TBI:
1) impairs brain repair, demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of traumatic axonal injury.
2) impairs recovery of cognitive function, measured by information processing speed and attention, and other clinical symptoms.
3) is associated with higher levels of persistent neuroinflammation measured using TSPO-R positron emission tomography (PET).

Methods: Prospective study comparing patients with and without the metabolic syndrome following moderate-severe TBI. Patients will be studied both at baseline and after one year follow-up with: 
(i) full clinical assessment in an established multidisciplinary TBI clinic including metabolic and endocrine phenotyping with measurements of dyslipidaemia, impaired glucose homeostasis, insulin resistance and hypertension; 
(ii) detailed structural MRI scans including T1,T2, SWI and diffusion tensor imaging (to analyse white matter tract structural integrity);
(iii) functional MRI scans to assess network integrity; 
(iv) cognitive measures of processing speed and attention, and symptomatic, psychological and quality of life assessment through validated questionnaires; 
(v) brain PET scanning with the ligand [18F]GE-180 (at baseline only) to measure microglial activation to establish if brain inflammation is an underlying explanatory mechanism.

Opportunities: The demonstration that metabolic syndrome impairs recovery after TBI will encourage investigation of the underlying mechanism through pre-clinical studies and eventually trials using currently available drugs for metabolic syndrome to improve clinical outcome in TBI.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>1) Who might benefit from this research?
