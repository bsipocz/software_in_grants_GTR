Asian Studies: Partnerships, Networks and Training</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/L006758/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Building upon the activities of the first phase of AHRC funding, WREAC continues, in the second phase, to build, nurture and sustain national capacity in Language-Based Area Studies by developing its PGR/ECR language and methods training provision, consolidating its partnerships with other academic institutions within and beyond the UK, including closer collaboration with other LBAS centres, and developing new research networks and knowledge exchange partnerships with a greater renewed focus on the arts and humanities to disseminate its research, as well as enhance the impacts of its research. WREAC's activities will be organised under three strands: 

(1) Identities and Cultures in East Asia: focuses on (a) Chinese theatre and performance: building on the work of this international, practice-based network, the project will build further PGR capacity, disseminate research findings at network events, and develop a major electronic resource including film, photography and video of a series of Chinese plays and productions, critical commentary, and archival material from the National Academy of Chinese Theatre Arts (Beijing); (b) Chinese authors, authorship and authority: through a new network of researchers working on concepts of authorship in China across different historical timeframes, the project questions the Eurocentric narrative on authorship and will provide a dynamic online resource for researchers, students and practising authors; and (c) an international (and cross-LBAS) network on memory in East Asia (and beyond) will focus on how communities use texts, material cultures, public events and performances as a means of mediating troubled pasts or rapid social change.

(2) Cross-cultural Encounters and Globalisation: under the broad label of cultural diplomacy/soft power, one element of this strand considers the role of informal actors in East Asian international relations, while another considers various aspects of Chinese, Japanese and Korean soft power and its influence in other parts of the world. The theme of religions in Asia forms another element, through collaboration with BICC on a network which explores changing forms of religious authority in Asia against a backdrop of social change. 

(3) Networks in Chinese and Japanese language and cultural training: this strand builds on the training element of our provision by expanding further the international network of supervisors of research students in Teaching Chinese as a Second Language (TCSL), with an international conference for supervisors on the one hand, and a student-led symposium on the other; in addition, resources for teaching and training purposes, and an edited volume representing cutting-edge research in the field of TCSL will be important outputs. In Japanese language training, we will build up our collection of online materials for PGT/PGR students, facilitating the transition to self-directed, self-motivated study with the inclusion of digital materials and new learning tools. The Staging China and Writing Chinese projects will also include substantial language and cultural training elements in the form of online, bilingual resources aimed, in both cases, at advanced learners of Chinese, as well as non-academic users.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>WREAC's activities in its current phase have maximised impact through internships, placements and partnerships, while also sustaining national capacity in East Asian studies and advanced language through training events, workshops, conferences, and the development of language materials. In the next phase, existing projects will consolidate links and develop networks further, while new projects will provide fresh opportunities for knowledge exchange and public engagement. Non-academic beneficiaries will include theatres and theatre practitioners, museums and schools, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Chinese authors, literary agencies and associations, and users of our web-based resources.
1. Identities and Cultures in East Asia
Staging China network activities will continue to epitomize the value of dialogue between researchers and practitioners, and the mutually-reinforcing nature of theory and practice. The network will extend the reach and significance of its impact still further with the creation of an unique electronic repository of stage productions with bilingual annotations and critical essays to be used by researchers who need primary resources, and by practitioners who want to stage a Chinese work. The repository will be a 'living resource' to be sustained beyond the funding period and, therefore, will have lasting impact.
Writing Chinese, a new project, will impact beyond academia through the placing of an intern in a Hong-Kong based literary agency; and by drawing Chinese authors directly into dialogue and discussions with the academics, literary theorists and critics who write about or study them through a guest lecture series, an international workshop, and talks (including readings and Q&amp;amp;A sessions) at the International Writers at Leeds (IWaL) series organised by the University of Leeds in partnership with the City of Leeds Library. The guest lecture series and IWaL talks, in particular, will enable the Chinese authors to reach an audience that would otherwise be inaccessible to them, and likewise, will introduce the general public to new genres of Chinese literature (translations will be undertaken by postgraduate interns).
Ruptured Pasts, Uncertain Futures will promote knowledge exchange with local museums (such as the Sheffield Industrial Museums Trust and the Weston Park Museum), the Historical Association and the University of the Third Age and with other external partners to be nurtured through the University of Sheffield's Arts Enterprise/Ideas Bazaar team. 
2. Activities undertaken in the Cross-Cultural Encounters and Globalisation strand will build on the WREAC-FCO seminars in the first phase, and will include a cross-LBAS knowledge exchange network and international conference, and an FCO workshop focusing on Cultural Diplomacy in East Asia and nation branding. 
3. Networks in Chinese and Japanese Language
The network of Supervisors of Research Students in TCSL is the first international network to have established both a supervisors and a students' association and is dedicated to a research and practice-based approach to TCSL. Since its establishment in 2012, its membership has expanded to include European and East Asian universities, and it already enjoys a reputation for attracting the leading scholars in the field of TCSL. The Transitions Japanese project builds on the WREAC's long-standing expertise in online and classroom-based language training across all levels, and will offer intensive summer schools and advanced language workshops to postgraduate students requiring specialist training, supported by innovative digital materials. Language and cultural training will also be a key feature of the bilingual resources developed for the Staging China and Writing Chinese projects, both of which will be designed to serve as advanced teaching materials for those interested in Chinese literature, literary translation, theatre and drama, and also as a cultural resource for non-academic users.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-02-13</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>313207</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>We commissioned three new illustrations by Isobel Haysom to accompany a translation event run collaboratively with the Free Word Centre in London</gtr:description><gtr:id>C038FC5F-085D-4777-946E-8498B154B8CC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Not known.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5898aeba25fa65.63451635</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Illustrations for translation event</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artwork</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Performances in UK and China of a newly written and created stage production combining elements relating to the two great playwrights William Shakespeare and Tang Xianzu.

The main focus of the project was the creation of a new stage production called 'A Midsummer Night's DREAMING Under the Southern Bough' ????? (provisional title). Two groups, one from UIBE and one from UoL, created a new piece of drama. The Chinese students, under the direction of Dr Li Jun, used Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream as their inspiration and the British students, under the direction of Staging China project team member and stage@leeds artistic director Steve Ansell, used Tang Xianzu's A Dream Under the Southern Bough.

The individual works created as part of the Shakespeare-Tang project were presented initially in their host Universities before being performed 'back-to-back' at festivals in Leeds (the opening of the 2016 Leeds Intercultural Festival), Edinburgh (Festival Fringe), Beijing, Shanghai, and in Tang's hometown of Fuzhou during the Tang Xianzu Memorial Festival.

The aim was to explore problems and strategies of recognition of religious authority in contemporary Asian religions in a comparative context. It brought together scholars who are working on both 'traditional' and new modes of authority, on both institutionalised religions and individual religious specialists, and on different religious traditions and movements in Japan, Korea, the PRC and Taiwan. Workshop participants examined these issues from three main perspectives: scholarly discourse on religions; relationships between religious specialists and their supporting communities; and the state-religion interface.
Project co-ordinators Erica Baffelli and Jane Caple are now working with the other participants to develop a publication and are currently in discussion with the editors of Asian Ethnology, a high profile peer-reviewed and open access journal about plans for a special double issue in 2017-18.

The event built on a workshop held at the University of Sheffield in June 2015 and attended by scholars based in European institutions, working primarily on China and Japan, and exploring pasts and futures in the contexts of war and the post-war, urban development and industrialisation, revolution and regime change, cultural production, and civic activism, with a focus on the following questions
? How do pasts and narratives of the past become hegemonic or official, dissonant, popular or viral, memorialised or silenced?
? How are futures and imaginations of the future desired, feared, realised or resisted in the present?
? How is authority over past and future imaginings asserted and enacted?
? What are the audiences of those narratives of past and future? How are these narratives framed and made usable, and what are their effects? What are the grammars of global or local memory or futurity?
? How, to what extent, and to what effect, are national pasts or futures supplanted by international or transnational narratives/imaginings?

In this second event, the organisers were particularly interested in exploring how comparative or transnational enquiry can enrich our understanding of those questions.

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has a strong history of working with a wide range of academics and non-governmental experts. Consulting experts with a variety of perspectives ensures that policy making discussions are informed by rigorous, timely research, allowing us to continuously challenge and shape our policy thinking. 

In March 2015, the FCO collaborated with the White Rose East Asia Centre in organising a one-day conference with staff from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's Asia Pacific Directorate and international academics. We were impressed by the high quality and range of participants that WREAC attracted, and the level of discussion generated. The papers (...) formed the basis for wide ranging policy discussion.

The event was open to the public.

As part of the event, storyteller Tim Ralphs helped a group of Sheffield researchers turn episodes from their working lives into engaging, entertaining tales. 

Research is full of stories, but academics don't always get the chance to pull out these specific encounters, tales or happenings from their research. Tales from the Ivory Tower is a public engagement project which began in the Faculty of Arts and Humanities at the University of Sheffield and was subsequently rolled out as a cross- faculty opportunity for researchers to take part in the Festival of the Mind. Researchers worked with professional storyteller Tim Ralphs in workshops on the nature and craft of storytelling; hearing Tim tell a tale, discussing techniques of storytelling and their research before going away to craft their own tale. In a second workshop session, Tim heard the stories and supported researchers to hone their work for public performance. The stories that you'll watch come from a variety of subject areas but all present compelling and fascinating tales of research, giving their audience an insight into the work that they do.

The 2-day event featured a series of lectures and workshops on how to translate and adapt Chinese drama plays into English. 

One of China's most prominent playwrights, Wan Fang, attended the event to work with MA students and members of staff on various transformations between genres, languages (not only between Chinese and English, but also between reading and performative texts) and cultures. A performance of scenes from 'Poison' by Wan Fang, a play translated into English by Newcastle MA Translation and Interpreting students in 2012-13, was given by members of stage@leeds as part of the colloquium. Professor Ruru Li and a PhD student from Translation Studies from Leeds attended the activity. 

In addition, a dramatic reading of the play was given to the public by Newcastle University students in their own English translation at Northern Stage (http://www.ncl.ac.uk/sml/about/events/item/Wan-Fang-Poison). 

The Colloquium attracted a large number of participants and enhanced collaboration between Leeds and Newcastle as outcomes of the event. Following on from their success with 'Poison', the stage@leeds company produced and staged another of Wan Fang's play, 'Murder' at Northern Stage in Newcastle, in 2015. In 2016, stage@leeds is currently working on a devised work 'A Dream under a Southern Bough' to mark the 400th anniversary of the death of Chinese playwright Tang Xianzu.

Lively discussion with the author and translator, plus question and answer session afterwards. This event was open to members of the public, academic colleagues and postgraduate and undergraduate students. This was followed by a literary translation masterclass for 20 participants, which addressed the rewards and challenges faced by literary and other translators. The translation masterclass, led by the author and her translator, was open to anyone interested in the translation of contemporary Chinese fiction into English.

The masterclass was followed by the launch of the Bai Meigui Literary Translation Competition. One of the key aims of the Writing Chinese project is to bring the most exciting new writing in Chinese to a wider audience, as well as to foster dialogue between new and established translators. One of the most interesting voices in contemporary fiction in Chinese - Dorothy Tse Hiu-hung (???) - shared her work for this competition. Dorothy is an award-winning Hong Kong author and teaches creative writing at Hong Kong Baptist University. She is also a co-founder of the respected literary magazine Fleurs des Lettres (??). Her short stories are noted for their surrealism, and a selection of them have been translated by Nicky Harman and published in an anthology entitled Snow and Shadow (HK: Muse, 2014). The story chosen for the competition is one of a selection of thirteen of Dorothy's very short stories, published as &amp;quot;Monthly Matters&amp;quot;. 

We had a great response to our Writing Chinese translation competition, with 88 entries from all over the world. Our panel of three judges (Nicky Harman, Helen Wang and Jeremy Tiang) had difficult decisions to make, as the standard was very high, and we ended up with a tie for first place (Natascha Bruce and Michael Day). The two winning entries have been published in issue 14 of Structo magazine, and both winners were awarded a bursary or a literary translation training workshop at the &amp;quot;Translate in the City&amp;quot; summer school.

Participants said they had enjoyed the session: 'I was pleased to see familiar faces and meet new ones. ... (it was) orchestrated very well, in a nice and non-threatening way, and have come home with all sorts of tips and ideas!'; 'The exercise in group translation was particularly exciting in that it challenged fixed ideas about how things should be translated.

Saturday November 7th: The 2015 Writing Chinese Translation Workshop
Translating Contemporary Chinese Poetry: Reflections, Readings and a Give-It-A-Go Workshop
Poetry experts and award-winning translators Canaan Morse, Eleanor Goodman and Dr Heather Inwood kicked off the morning with presentations and poetry readings. After lunch, there was a hands-on session, facilitated by Canaan and Eleanor, looking at some poems by contemporary prize-winning poets Lan Lan ?? and Qin Xiaoyu ???. No prior experience of poetry translation necessary, but experienced translators were also very welcome. The event was attended by a large number of people, mainly students of translation, academics, and members of the public with an interest in Chinese literature. At the end of the event, the second Bai Meigui Translation Competition was launched in collaboration with READ PAPER REPUBLIC. The winning translation will be published as one of the READ PAPER REPUBLIC short story series, and will also be eligible for a bursary for the City University (London) summer school in literary translation. 
Last year's competition was a great success, with over 80 entries from around the world. Our joint winners were published in Structo magazine, and four runners-up had their translations published on our website.
The competition is free to enter, and is open to anyone, from any country, with an interest in Chinese-English translation.
This year, our competition text is by Li Jingrui ???. The text we have chosen is a piece of reportage. A journalist for eight years, Li Jingrui now writes her own column in the Chinese edition of The Wall Street Journal, and also publishes short fiction. One of her stories, 'Missing', translated by Helen Wang, is our bookclub choice for November, and has also been featured as part of the READ PAPER REPUBLIC series. Another of her stories, 'A Quiet Winter', has been translated into English by Nicholas Richards and published on The World of Chinese site.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56afa1452a4052.17352660</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://writingchinese.leeds.ac.uk/events/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Children's Literature Day (Writing Chinese)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1B513C42-A50A-4943-8E79-BEC6FEC46203</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A full day symposium bringing together librarians, academics, translators and school teachers focussing on Chinese children's literature, in honour of the recent Hans Christian Andersen award to the Chinese children's author Cao Wenxuan.

In preparation for the visit to WREAC of the Hokkaido participants, PGR students were paired up in advance to share their research findings and practise their English and Japanese language skills for the purpose of the research presentations. The workshop was a combination of student presentations, research presentations by academic members of staff from Leeds and Hokkaido, and training sessions on the pragmatics of research. Poster presentations were produced by students who did not undertake a formal presentation.
The workshop was highly successful and underscored the importance of international exchange and training opportunities. Students particularly welcomed the opportunity to network with peers and academic members of staff, and found the environment highly stimulating.
The partnership with Hokkaido will continue, and the group has been expanded to include links with Helsinki University. Hokkaido University will be providing financial support for the 2016 event, and additional funding (e.g. from the HEFCE-PSS scheme) will also contribute to the project's sustainability into 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56df26a4103584.23237194</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Traditional Chinese Theatre workshop (Staging China) May 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B2017672-52C6-44DC-AD72-4DF4CFBDE2B1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A workshop offering British theatre practitioners and students the opportunity to gain knowledge and skills of the traditional Chinese theatre.

'Murder', which was presented as a companion piece to 'Poison' in an abridged form using a new script translated by Newcastle University MA students. This production, like 'Poison' was presented as part of a colloquium dedicated to the issues and challenges surrounding theatrical translation and working with translated texts. These challenges were discussed by the stage@leedscompany in a question and answer session directly following the show.

The Beijing Independent Film Festival had become one of China's most important outlets for independent feature and documentary film,and its host organisation held one of the country's largest archives of independent film. In August 2014, after the festival was closed down by the Beijing authorities, a selection of films from the festival programme was acquired by a team of film-makers and film scholars based in north America and made available internationally. The films shown in Sheffield screenings were Xu Tong, Cut Out the Eyes; Yang Pingdao, River of Life; and Hu Jie, Spark. The series thus showcased the work of two established and highly respected film-makers, Xu and Hu, as well as the rising director, Yang Pingdao. The films were chosen for their connection with core project themes, from the reinvention of traditions in a rapidly changing society, through practices of personal and family history-telling, to the challenges of bringing taboo past events and experiences into the public eye. The films were introduced by Dr Marjorie Dryburgh, with opportunities for informal Q&amp;amp;A after the screenings.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5898a3f61e5d34.79999853</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.showroomworkstation.org.uk/china-now</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>WREAC/EANet research workshop: Sheffield, Apr 24-25, 2014 - Memory in East Asia: Ruptured Pasts, Contested Presents, Uncertain Futures Conference</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>88C48197-EB43-4472-8E0E-392A7B416AAD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The workshop sparked academic discussion about the topic of memory.

The inaugural event took place on 9 October 2014, with readings from the work of controversial author Chen Xiwo followed by a lively discussion and Q&amp;amp;A session with the author, his translator and publisher and a sizeable audience. This event was open to members of the public, academic colleagues and postgraduate and undergraduate students. The talk was followed by the launch of the project network and website: http://writingchinese.leeds.ac.uk/.

Part of a series of talks organised by the Writing Chinese project. On 15 October 2015, the project welcomed author Diao Dou ?? to Leeds, along with Sam Clark and Ra Page from Comma Press. Comma are a Manchester-based publisher, and loyal champions both of the short story form and of literature in translation. They have just published the first English translation (by Brendan O'Kane) of Diao Dou's short fiction - 'Points of Origin'. In this collection, a town is overrun with cockroaches, which prove more than a match for the local officials; a widower and his cat move into the city, but the cat is not all that she seems; and in the story we've chosen for our October book club, a law is passed that only lets people walk the streets at night if they maintain a squatting position at all times
Diao Dou read an excerpt of one of the stories, 'Vivisection'. This story presented something which is often dealt with in contemporary Chinese fiction - the Cultural Revolution - in a slightly off-kilter way, providing a good example of how his stories mix the realistic and the surreal. We were then given a fascinating insight into the translation process through a video with translator Brendan O'Kane, who talked about some of the challenges of translating these stories, and of how to convey some of the trickier points of Chinese idiom and shared knowledge.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56af99d615df19.22913428</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://writingchinese.leeds.ac.uk/events/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Author talk with Xu Xiaobin (Writing Chinese)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C4024161-86B7-44B9-9CBE-071681A64B05</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A dialogue between Xu Xiaobin and her translator Nicky Harman in the form of a guided interview followed by Q&amp;amp;A from the floor.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5898aa17e1b214.03706389</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://writingchinese.leeds.ac.uk/events</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Writing Chinese - Talk 4 Reading and Q&amp;A with author and poet Han Dong and his translator Nicky Harman</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4279F33D-4511-477B-B881-AAD41D0A5DF0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Open to the general public.

The forum was attended by 14 TCFL researchers and teachers from eight UK universities and three high schools. Discussions focussed on what is meant by culture (and Chinese culture in particular), why TCFL teaching must inevitably involve passing on some knowledge of Chinese culture, and how this can best be achieved.
On the back of this successful first forum, plans have already been made to hold a follow-up event to be hosted jointly by the University of Cardiff and the University of Central Lancashire in 2017. The two universities and the related Confucius Institutions will provide financial support.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56df09c12b8b16.10769638</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Film Screening '3/11' and  Q&amp;A with director Mori Tatsuya</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>71F6A65C-80CC-418B-824B-56613B050050</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As part of the Ruptured Pasts, Uncertain Futures project, eminent Japanese documentary-maker Mori Tatsuya visited Sheffield for a screening of his film '311' in an open event in co-operation with Showroom Cinema Sheffield. 

Four years ago, a triple disaster of earthquake, tsunami and nuclear accident struck the Tohoku region of northern Japan. Two weeks afterwards, in the midst of the chaos and uncertainty surrounding the recovery and the ongoing crisis at the Fukushima nuclear reactor, a group of four filmmakers traveled north from Tokyo on a road trip to document first hand the immediate aftermath of one of Japan's worst peacetime disasters.

This screening of 311, co-sponsored by the White Rose East Asia Centre and the University of Sheffield, saw one of Japan's leading independent filmmakers, director Mori Tatsuya, visiting Sheffield for the first time. A QandA with Mori and project team member, Dr Mark Pendleton, of the School of East Asian Studies at the University of Sheffield followed the screening.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56bde33d2fe4e2.04746161</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.showroomworkstation.org.uk/311</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Writing Chinese - International symposium on Chinese Literature, University of Leeds</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>79C72776-BB4F-42A5-AD94-1AD58D72C51D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The first year of the project culminated with a symposium, 2-4 July 2015, bringing together key figures in the field of new Chinese writing, in a unique gathering of authors, translators, academics, editors, publishers, and literary agents. All roundtable discussions are available to view on the website (http://writingchinese.leeds.ac.uk). 
The symposium followed the journey of a story from its origins in the imaginations of authors, through its progress through the publishing world and its translation into English, to its reception by readers, critics and academics. Panel presentations and roundtable discussions, as well as author readings were held. The two guest authors were Dorothy Tse (???) and Murong Xuecun (????). Other guest speakers were: Translators Nicky Harman and Helen Wang, and translator and writer Jeremy Tiang, all of whom made up the judging panel for our Bai Meigui Translation Competition; Dave Haysom, translator and editor of Pathlight Magazine; Michel Hockx, Professor of Chinese at SOAS; Heather Inwood, Lecturer in Chinese Cultural Studies at the University of Manchester; Marysia Juszczakiewicz, founder and owner of Hong Kong-based Peony Literary Agency; Jo Lusby, Managing Director of Penguin China; James Shea, poet and Assistant Professor in Cultural Studies at Hong Kong Baptist University; and Harvey Thomlinson, CEO of Make-Do Publishing.
The symposium was followed by a public event held in conjunction with the Free Word Centre and the Leeds Writers Circle, on Saturday 4 July, with author readings in the morning by Jeremy Tiang, James Shea and Murong Xuecun. In the afternoon we were delighted to host the UK launch of the Read Paper Republic initiative, where one Chinese short story in English translation is being made available online to view every week for the next 12 months. Attended by around 40 people.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56af98c9ab4393.18924932</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://writingchinese.leeds.ac.uk/symposium/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>TCSL PG Workshop, University of Sheffield, 16 Jan 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5B8C4BE9-321A-425F-BF17-CD614BC6E5C2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A total of eight research students, from the UK, Hungary, China and Indonesia made presentations based on their MA/ Ph.D research, and received feedback from a panel of established researchers from four UK universities.

All students who took part said they learned a great deal from this process.
In a separate session, in response to a request from last year, three established researchers also made presentations on research projects they were working on. Feedback from students was that these were extremely useful examples of how to conduct and present research.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56df08e6abd300.73751089</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Staging China, A Midsummer Night's DREAMING Under the Southern Bough (Leeds, Edinburgh)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9B8A3CCF-0FDE-48B6-AEFA-40032F215871</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Approx. 800 theatre audiences saw the back-to-back performance of two productions A Midsummer Night's DREAMING Under the Southern Bough, in which Chinese students performed Shakespeare while British students presented Tang Xianzu.

Our seminars and workshops with the FCO have helped to inform policymakers on a range of issues facing East Asian governments and their relations with the UK and Europe, including key bilateral relations in the region (Japan-China, Japan-Korea), energy and environmental issues, social policy and so on. 

At the level of the local or regional community, some of WREAC's non-academic partnerships have helped to strengthen our dissemination and impact activities in deepening knowledge of Chinese and Japanese culture. For example, the Writing Chinese team linked with the International Writers at Leeds series, a programme of public readings by writers around the world to bring new Chinese writers to the notice of the general public. WREAC has also worked closely with the Sheffield Showroom Cinema in the running and promotion of screenings of East Asian films. Building on previous WREAC-Showroom events (for example those linked to the Ruptured Pasts project), this collaboration has continued in 2017. 


The activities of the Staging China and Writing Chinese projects have contributed to a greater public and professional understanding of aspects of Chinese culture and society in the UK. In both cases, the project teams have developed extensive links with a variety of non-academic partners, from theatre groups and practitioners to publishing companies, professional literary translators and a range of Chinese authors. Through symposia, practical workshops, drama performances, author Q&amp;amp;A sessions, and web repositories the projects have impacted upon professional and public audiences by raising awareness, and improving the accessibility of, contemporary and classical Chinese theatre and writing in English translation. 

Specifically, the Writing Chinese project has generated a high level of interest from, and engagement with, UK and non-UK publishers, school teachers and pupils, exam board and curricula setters, and the general public. The project's website serves as a resource for both academic and non-academic readers, and, through its coverage of new, up-and-coming, and often very controversial authors has helped to stimulate discussion and broaden readers' perspectives of what contemporary Chinese fiction might mean. The launch of the project's highly successful translation competition tapped into high levels of interest in the process of literary translation, and in its first year attracted 88 entrants from all over the world, from a mix of established/professional translators, and novices. The quality of entries was described by the judges (a panel of internationally established and award-winning translators) as outstanding. The project's partnerships with respected fiction magazine Structo and renowned literary magazine Stand, and the publication therein of the winning entries to the translation competitions has helped to extend the reach of the project, and knowledge of Chinese fiction still further. 

The project has also been highly successful in promoting new Chinese writing in English translation. New partnerships have been developed with publishers (both major international and independent presses) who have benefitted from being able to connect with the new Chinese fiction market, and have been enthusiastic contributors to the network, regularly including references to the project in their press releases about new books. The online book club has featured a new author each month, and linked this to forthcoming publications and book tours, with a wide range of authors visiting Leeds for book readings. At least one of the short stories has since been published in a bilingual edition by Daylight Publishing House, and is now under consideration for inclusion in the new A-level syllabus.

The various initiatives falling under the Staging China project have contributed to a greater inter-cultural awareness of theatre methods and practice in China and the UK by developing an international network of scholars, theatre companies and theatre practitioners. In addition, the project team's development of the Digital Library of Chinese Theatre, with cooperation from theatre companies across China, provides a bilingual compendium of Chinese theatre scripts and audio-video clips across a wide range of genres. It offers a unique resource for teachers, students, researchers, theatre practitioners and the general public. Finally, the co-production of a newly-written play (by colleagues and students at the University of Leeds, and one of our partner institutions the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing) was inspired by the works of William Shakespeare and Tang Xianzu to mark the 400th anniversary of their deaths. The performances of the play in three cities in the UK (including the Edinburgh Festival) and four cities in China reached a combined audience of over 2000 and received very positive feedback from theatre practitioners, scholars, students and the general public. The play and the accompanying workshops and seminars received considerable media attention in both countries. The project encouraged people to think about the value and relevance of two classic plays to contemporary society and to enhance cultural exchange between China and the UK. In particular, it provided the opportunity for creative teams from two different cultures to creatively explore, understand and appreciate each other's similarities and distinctions through the work of two great writers and the shared language of theatre, and resulted in a series of internationally acclaimed collaborative events. At policy level, the success of Staging China's Shakespeare-Tang Xianzu events encouraged Chinese policy makers to consider new ways of promoting Chinese culture and cultural legacies.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>DD28707B-CE71-4ABC-9CEC-5F0E856C0BEF</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56debdb538a818.61640996</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>During the second and final phase of AHRC funding, WREAC has achieved its aims of continuing to build, grow, and sustain national capacity in East Asian Studies through its focus on PGR and ECR advanced language and methods training, and academic collaboration with other UK and international academic institutions, including the other LBAS centres. This phase has also seen the development of new research networks and knowledge exchange partnerships, in addition to the expansion and enhancement of existing collaborations with non-academic partners. 

WREAC organised its Phase 2 projects within three existing strands: Identities and Cultures in East Asia; Cross-cultural Encounters and Globalisation; and Networks in Chinese and Japanese Language and Cultural Training. In turn, the projects addressed the AHRC development pathways, with most project activities falling across two, if not all three, pathways.&amp;nbsp;

All the sub-projects achieved their individual objectives, and some have exceeded expectations by expanding beyond the original plans having secured follow-on funding (Writing Chinese/Reading Chinese), external funding and support from overseas institutions (TCSL and Tandem Learning), and sponsorship from non-academic partners (Staging China, Writing Chinese). This will enable sustainability for some of the projects beyond the AHRC-funded period, while others have completed as expected.


The breadth of coverage of our projects and networks pursued under the development funding has enabled us to engage with a wide range of academic and non-academic partners. For example, the projects funded during the first phase (2012-2014) facilitated academic exchange and public engagement in the fields of stage and cinema (the Mixed Cinema Network), foreign policy (the FCO-WREAC seminars), socio-economics (Matanle's Shrinking Regions, and Conrad's Negotiating with Asia projects), and international business (the China-Japan Observatory). We were able to expand our scope further in the second phase of funding by involving more WREAC colleagues working in the Arts and Humanities to incorporate the creative industries (through Staging China and Writing Chinese), and to develop our research networks on soft power, and history and memory. Simultaneously, the funding enabled us to maintain our focus on advanced language and research methodology training in East Asian Studies through the Tandem Learning and Teaching Chinese as a Second Language projects, and via our regular PGR workshops and away days (in collaboration with other LBAS centres).

The complementarity of academic expertise and networks in East Asian Studies at Leeds and Sheffield was also a strength, and produced a critical mass of scholars working across the social sciences and humanities. The development of such close academic collaboration between the two institutions testifies to the benefit of funding across institutions. The two institutions have been able draw on their hitherto separate academic networks in China and Japan in a way for colleagues at the two institutions to gain the most from the exploitation of their dual networks. In this way, our PGRS and ECRS, as well as our more established academics, have benefitted from and become embedded in global academic networks</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>One of WREAC's most enduring legacies is in the area of capacity-building and training, and we are proud to have nurtured an outstanding cohort of East Asian specialists. WREAC alumni have embarked on careers in academic establishments in East Asia as well as the UK and Europe. Some of our former PGRs and post-doctoral fellows are now employed at the universities of Edinburgh, Leeds, Manchester, and at UCLAN, UEA, and LSE while others are further afield in Sweden (Lund University), Singapore (Nanyang Technological University), and Japan (Chiba University), as well as in the non-academic sector (FCO, UN, business and marketing in China). A further legacy is one of impact (see Narrative Impact) - in both academic and non-academic spheres - which we have achieved through our engagement with an extensive network of partners across a range of themes, embracing multi- and inter-disciplinary approaches to language-based area studies research. 

A number of the research and training networks developed during the funding period have become well established and we envisage that they will continue in one form or another, with funding from other sources already secured or being sought. For example, the TCLS team has secured funding from its various partner organisations until 2019 and is in discussion with new institutions for funding beyond that point. We are applying to UK-based Japanese Studies funding bodies for support to attend the Tandem Learning workshop to be organised in Helsinki in 2017. One member of the Sino-Japanese Relations Research Network has secured funding for a workshop in Berlin in 2017 on globalising rivalry in Sino-Japanese relations. In addition, we have had success with AHRC follow-on funding for the Writing Chinese project, now called 'Reading Chinese' (PI Weightman, Co-I Rose), and one of the newer sub-projects from the memory cluster (Music and Memory) will go forward in 2017/2018 with support from the University of Hokkaido and coordinated by Ishikawa (formerly Sheffield) who has been awarded a JSPS Fellowship. Finally, we will aim to continue to run regular WREAC PGR training events, with the help of funding from our respective institutions and the ESRC White Rose Social Sciences DTC (East Asian Studies pathway). Resources and news relating to the various projects will remain available via the WREAC main website and 'mini-sites'. For example, the Staging China, Digital Chinese Theatre Library, and Writing Chinese websites provide a wealth of bilingual materials which are of use to researchers, teachers, and practitioners alike.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>EE6FD05B-95DF-4A35-A4FF-C3BBE84A47F2</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dedec27fa789.09989942</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.wreac.org</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Teaching materials for schools (Writing Chinese)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8C733F67-C164-4CBC-8C1A-F3B02E397001</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5898acfe0377a6.31210539</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Glenn Hook, member of UK-Japan 21st Century Group</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Asia</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E89E4C8C-8559-4CA5-8593-507CCDE1B8D0</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56df21d8535ef0.53875517</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>06047190-9B13-47B6-8671-65DE216978E4</gtr:id><gtr:title>???????:???????/???? ?
