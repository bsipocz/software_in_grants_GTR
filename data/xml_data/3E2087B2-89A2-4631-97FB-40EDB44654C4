However, until relatively recently, researchers have been largely restricted to gathering accounts of readers' experiences from sources with limited evidence such as marginalia or accounts in diaries and letters, which are time-consuming to gather, or from somewhat artificial contexts such as interviews, questionnaires and focus groups, where what Pierre Bourdieu has termed the &amp;quot;legitimacy effect&amp;quot; - which prompts individuals to report on what they consider they ought to have read, or ought to think, rather than what they have actually read or actually think - may hamper the investigation. The advent of social media platforms, and the unprecedented amount of user-generated data they produce, has opened up compelling new avenues for research into reading, an experience long considered personal and private which is increasingly coming into view as a cultural activity whose social dimensions are equally as complex and as vital to understand. 

Not only has user-generated data from social media platforms given researchers very large amounts of data to work with, it has also added new forms of information, such as numerical ratings of books accompanying descriptive reviews, and information about readers' &amp;quot;affinity&amp;quot; with others depending on the number of books in their shared collections (a more complex version of Amazon's recommendation algorithm that suggests books that users may wish to buy by comparing their purchasing or browsing activity to those of others). With these new forms of data, however, has come a parallel obligation for scholars to develop robust methodologies for their analysis, including the capacity to make use of the rich metadata - the temporal and geospatial information attached to some of the information produced by users - on social network sites. In the commercial world, such information is already exploited by marketers through such techniques as sentiment analysis - automated analysis that can identify whether a tweet is broadly negative or positive - but such techniques are too crude for understanding the complex interplay between texts and readers as meaning and value are negotiated. This is the gap that this project seeks to fill. By capturing information from two platforms used by individuals to report on their reading and to connect with other readers - Twitter and the book-collection website LibraryThing - it will investigate what this born-digital data can tell us about readers' interactions with texts by taking samples of this data, and exploring and refining the methods that can be used to deal with it, particularly as it contains both numerical and descriptive elements. It will apply techniques of computational analysis to this data to identify significant patterns in relation to three areas. First, thematic and topical information: what do readers choose to foreground when they go to the trouble of broadcasting their thoughts on Twitter or LibraryThing? Second, chronological trends: do particular terms become prominent in online interactions at particular times, and how might these trends relate to events such as the publication of books which achieve mass popularity such as the Harry Potter volumes or Fifty Shades of Grey? Third, geographical influences: do socio-economic factors or the existence of book-related institutions such as bookstores and libraries play a role in influencing the spatial distribution of online interactions around books? By using these disparate methodologies in concert, and finding ways to productively combine them, the project will both advance knowledge about the intrinsic value texts represent to readers, and point to ways that this research can be carried out with ever-larger bodies of data in the future.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The beneficiaries of this research are, broadly speaking, the range of actors and institutions involved in authoring, producing and distributing books, and those engaged in facilitating engagement with literature such as reader development librarians, educators and book group leaders. Some of these roles are captured by Robert Darnton's influential 1982 diagram of the communications circuit, but in an era in which when some texts never make - or indeed need to make - the transition from the digital screen to the printed page, additional actors need to be added to Darnton's model, such as the programmers who refine the search algorithms that take users' search engine queries and produce results which direct them to one book over another, and those who run online communities such as LibraryThing whose attraction is such that they can sustain participation by users who may never meet any of their interlocutors face-to-face. 

These actors have various vested interests in learning more about the complex interplay of interrelated qualities that makes a text particularly appealing, challenging or otherwise memorable to a reader, and will benefit from the research in line with those interests. Reader development librarians seeking a book for a citywide &amp;quot;one book&amp;quot; programme that will appeal to a wide range of readers, for instance, will benefit from insights into what readers report enjoying about particular books as they make their choice. Those involved in producing book group guides - whether commercially, voluntarily, or as part of third-sector work - will be able to gain a sense of the kinds of themes readers are drawn to discussing, and those topics or textual elements to which readerly attention may need to be more explicitly drawn. Published authors, or writers seeking publication, may find it helpful to learn what kind of textual elements generate excitement among readers as they frame their books to publishers and literary agents. Similarly, publishers attempting to bring their lists to the attention of an audience with ever-growing claims on its digital attention will benefit from knowledge about the substantive content of online book discussions and conversations on Twitter, especially as these relate to events in the publishing world that become prominent enough to merit media interest (such as the advent of another Fifty Shades of Grey or a book and movie cross-promotion such as the Twilight franchise).

The geospatial component of the analysis (which, as detailed elsewhere in this proposal, will be closely tied to the thematic and chronological analysis) will have an additional group of beneficiaries: municipal and community authorities with responsibility for planning. This group will be able to use the GIS produced by the project to examine the relationship between, on the one hand, the physical emplacement of literary institutions such as libraries, bookstores, and locations hosting book groups such as cafes, pubs and private homes, and, on the other, spatial data revealing where online conversations around books tend to occur, and hence the physical spaces where book-related activities can be understood to cluster.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>16982</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop (University of Bournemouth)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>06F27E11-1742-4FC1-91AA-22C24853F4E9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I gave a workshop on using Twitter to gather data for reception study, to an audience of about 15 other academics at a conference which ran as part of the AHRC-funded Digital Reading Network.
