Non-professionals are now sharing forms of documentary reflection by publishing text, stills and increasingly video online. This project is situated in the context of this emerging field of participatory media and explores how it might develop in the second generation web environment known as 'Web 2.0.' \n'Web 1.0' can be seen as a publishing platform, an information source which included many personal web sites. The 'Web 2.0' platform arguably facilitates mass collaboration through data sharing, social networks, folksonomies, online tools for content creation, and rich media. Wikipedia, Flickr, Facebook exemplify 'Web 2.0' and suggest its power. With 'Web 2.0' evolving rapidly we are only just beginning to glimpse the creative potential of this space. This project will work with and reflect on 'Web 2.0' tools and applications and explore the new forms of creativity that it allows. \nMany documentaries can now be accessed online / whether short form video or longer 'auteur' work / but these are generally linear pieces which simply use the web as a distribution platform. More dynamic possibilities are emerging. On some video sharing sites and in Vlogs (video blogs) one can see pieces created in a 'a call and response' mode; a creative dialogue in rich media. Additionally there are some experiments in collaboration underway / the Echo Chamber project in the field of journalism, the mashups in OpenSource.com. My concern is with what a documentary practice might look like which takes advantage of the alleged affordances of Web 2.0 - the dialogic and collaborative potential of the network, the online tools for content creation and sharing. All new media form themselves out existing cultural practices. My project will investigate / in practice and in theory / the potential for the 'creative treatment of actuality' (John Grierson's definition of documentary) as a collaborative practice in the Web 2.0 environment. \nThese are urgent issues for Documentary, New Media Studies and for the media industry and ones which I believe I am perfectly placed to address. \n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>235601</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Mary Ward is a web documentary project - the third practice output of the Fellowship.

Project - the practice output of the Fellowship in Creative and Performing Arts. 
The Project is a multi-year, multi-facetted exploration of the intersection between documentary and networked culture. Fifty years after Jean Rouch and Edgar Morin launched their seminal 1961 documentary, 'Chronique d'un Et&amp;eacute;', at a new moment of technological change, Rose has gathered footage from filmmakers and film enthusiasts around the world who she invited to revisit or restage the vox pop sequences from that film. 

Launched in May 2013 - Searching for Happiness takes advantage of the latest generation of web technology (HTML5) to investigate the potential of live data for the &amp;quot;creative treatment of actuality&amp;quot; (John Grierson's 1926 definition of documentary). Selected video contributions are combined through montage with social media - Tweets, Flickr images - drawn in 'live'. In this version of the project, entitled 'Searching for Happiness', the use of social media provides live re-contextualisation of the video content, re-inscribing some of the social and cultural surround that is lost within the filming process. Based on search terms, the social media is contingent, specific and emergent, so that the user-experience of the documentary changes from person to person and moment to moment. In this respect 'Searching for Happiness' offers an enunciation of documentary as live experience and open text.

Grounded by its reference to a previous moment of innovation, The 'Are You Happy?' Project provides a framework that elucidates the mix of continuity and novelty at play in digital documentary. The reference to Rouch also evokes his view of documentary as a process of collaborative meaning-making, which provides a context for a critical focus on the co-creative aspects of this work and of wider trends in crowd-sourcing documentary content.</gtr:description><gtr:id>0A50E64D-7E40-446D-92FF-51540F17A3B8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Showing the project has stimulated substantial interest in the potential of live data as a component of documentary.

The presentation employed Ivan Ilich's concept of &amp;quot;convivial tools&amp;quot; as a framework for thinking about participatory and &amp;quot;user-generated&amp;quot; documentary content. The presentation drew on examples, of practice that I'd been part of - BBC's Video Nation (access TV), Capture Wales (digital storytelling), My Science Fiction Life (collaborative cultural history), and work in the emerging field of collaborative online documentary - The Message and Mapping Main Street.

 

The framework of &amp;quot;conviviality&amp;quot; highlights ethics and social value, and encourages connections to be identified with historical practices - Mass Observation, the &amp;quot;shared anthropology&amp;quot; of Jean Rouch - and with wider contemporary cultural practice - DIY culture, participatory art, and Craftivism.

I have been and continue to be invited to present my work in a variety of KE and industry contexts in the UK and abroad. In particular I have been invited to talk within the BBC on a number of occasions - streamed live to three locations at a BBC Connected Studio development lab in 2013 for instance, and have been cited as an influence on the development of the BBC iWonder interactive learning platform and on a forthcoming participatory media platform. I was an advisor on the AHRC funded REACT Future Documentary Sandbox (2013) and have been invited to take part as a &amp;quot;Decision Maker&amp;quot; in Sheffield DocFest's Crossover Market (2013 -16). I am one of the curators on the MIT OpenDoc Lab _docubase - a key resource for practitioners of emerging documentary. In 2014 / 2015 I was the only UK advisor on MIT Open Documentary Lab's MacArthur Foundation funded research - Mapping the Intersection of Two Cultures; Interactive Documentary and Digital Journalism - a resource intended to support the media industry within journalism and more broadly in managing editorial strategy around convergence. As an advisor I attended a convening at MIT OpenDocLab - offering insight and chairing a panel in a gathering which featured representatives from the New York Times, The Guardian, the BBC, The Sundance Institute as well as leading Professors in the field of convergence - Henry Jenkins, Andrew DeVigal among them. At the same time, as Co-Director of the i-Docs project, I bring my research to bear in leading UWE Bristol's i-Docs project - developing and supporting the i-Docs community of scholars and makers - co-convening the i-Docs Symposia - 2012,14,16, co-hosting the facebook group (2,000+ participants) and overseeing the website. i-Docs is the major international meeting point for scholars and practitioners of emerging documentary, and my input to these sites provides and supports KE. These engagements provide practitioners with access to my research in a context where documentary is undergoing transformation within its form, market, distribution and exhibition. Practitioners need to better understand that context and the opportunities that this represents. Feedback has shown that my work provides a valuable insight for practitioners as they grapple with those changes.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2010</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>BC88CBB4-A988-4436-921D-1EE3153B77F7</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5464d4214a9447.95729794</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1. My central research insight concerns the disruption to documentary which has come about in the context of digital. The impact is not only expressed at the level of form. Computerisation and the social, semantic and open web are between them producing an environment in which documentary tools, technology, funding, form, process, authorship and distribution are all reworked, and the audience become actors - capturing, liking, sharing, and potentially producing content. Documentary is transformed within a new media ecology. 

2. Lev Manovich and Henry Jenkins have both observed the tendency within digital culture for marginal twentieth-century cultural forms to be reinvented. My second key insight concerns the contemporary re-emergence and transformation of forms of community media and participatory art. Building (at times explicitly) on 20th century precedents in participatory art, community and access video, documentarists are seeking approaches to making purposeful digital work with people rather than about them. They adopt a range of modes - acting as facilitators, curators, collaborators. They experiment with architectures of participation, seeking ethical and aesthetic strategies; ways to be true to participants and engage an audience, to create the conditions within which a necessary story can be told, in a context of meaningful dialogue. 

3. In this new environment the role of the director/producer is often becoming a practice of co-creativity. I have explored this role in the growing repository of interviews with key practitioners published on the CollabDocs blog. One feature of this environment is an emphasis on process and face-to-face interaction with interactive media providing a stage for a public conversation. A co-creative approach to documentary provides a progressive re-working of documentary's historic role in the public sphere, as an open space for dialogue and a stage for the performance of citizenship. 

4. The fourth research finding concerns the potential for documentary within the 'ubiquitous data' that is both consequence and driver of the online environment. In particular I have noted the morphing of the character of video in the context of the latest web coding language, HTML5. Before that coding language became common web video was impervious to its life online; published online in a way that reproduced the conditions of the TV screen. Now, existing databases and live information drawn from social media can be connected to the documentary environment, offering opportunities for the production of new kinds of knowledge and application. 

The affordances of networked connectivity offer the potential to re-contextualise documentary material through mobilising the enormous co-creative potential of human discourse captured in the web. This has been a central theme of my web documentary, &amp;quot;Searching for Happiness&amp;quot;. That documentary has sought to find a form to shape live content into a coherent experience. The project points the way to the re-invention of documentary for the online environment and the creation of new visual and informational grammars.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The invitations that I continue to receive to speak, present, and participate in a variety of convenings both in the UK and internationally attest to the substantial interest that there is in the insights I have developed within the framework of the CollabDocs AHRC Research Fellowship within creative economy and pedagogical contexts. Documentary is in a process of transformation as described above as well as hybridising with other genres. The intersection between journalism and documentary online is of particular note. Research is required to map these new landscapes and consider the reframing of both cultures. How does the reader / user comprehend content where journalisms's strict codes around impartiality and consent meet the looser, more creative framework of documentary? 
There is much interest among practitioners also in the community media and Access TV precedents of 21st century participatory documentary. Further work could address specific case studies and develop resources to equip documentarians with models and protocols so that they can to think about how to work effectively and ethically with non-professionals. 
 
Additionally there is significant interest among practitioners in the use of live data within documentary - a central exploration within the Searching for Happiness project. There is a project in development for CDEC Creative Catapult by my colleague Jon Dovey which builds on the findings from that project. This proposes the development of a platform for industry - The Context Engine - which would allow editors / users to plug live data into documentary content.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A0B19E4D-6012-4D02-9D26-5BF530502949</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5464cfbf812139.52122926</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://collabdocs.wordpress.com</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D1E04246-ADD8-4E99-B1E5-4B89A76F6C42</gtr:id><gtr:title>We're happy and we know it: Documentary, data, montage</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Studies in Documentary Film</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f773522bb4bc0b1a1ae6b06f029ae1a8"><gtr:id>f773522bb4bc0b1a1ae6b06f029ae1a8</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dovey J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d0820821951032</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>647C71C8-90CC-40D2-A130-98BC7926DB5B</gtr:id><gtr:title>DIY Citizenship: Critical Making and Social Media</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2cc21885aa88b2e46d3cf093ee508ccd"><gtr:id>2cc21885aa88b2e46d3cf093ee508ccd</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rose, M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-0-262-02681-9</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>i-1037568069.0981153bb6ccaa</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8BB98B5E-4DF8-4FA9-8E4C-5B65D9D196DA</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Documentary Film Book</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/18f859e6215456f192954578aaf872fc"><gtr:id>18f859e6215456f192954578aaf872fc</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rose, M.
