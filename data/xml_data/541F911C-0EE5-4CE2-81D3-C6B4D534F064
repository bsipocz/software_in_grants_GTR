Most chemotherapy works by damaging DNA, and when a cell detects this DNA damage a suicide pathway which is programmed into all our cells gets switched on. Previous research by our group has shown that the status of a protein called BRCA1 is important in determining whether a breast tumour cell switches on this suicide programme in the presence of DNA damaging chemotherapy. If a woman inherits a faulty version of BRCA1, her chances of developing breast cancer are greatly increased, however paradoxically the resulting breast tumour cell is much more sensitive to DNA damaging chemotherapy than a breast tumour cell which has normal functioning BRCA1. This is an important issue for the treatment of breast cancer because breast cancer which develops due to the inheritance of a faulty BRCA1 protein represents only 5% of all breast cancers. The research outlined in this proposal seeks to determine how the presence of BRCA1 allows a breast tumour cell to evade death in the presence of DNA damage. We have identified another protein called NFkB which only becomes active when tumour cells which have functioning BRCA1 are treated with DNA damaging chemotherapy. We have shown that if we stop NFkB becoming active in cells which have functional BRCA1, we can cause these cells to enter suicide mode thus rendering the tumour sensitive to DNA damage. We conclude that the ability of BRCA1 to turn on NFkB, is an important prerequisite for BRCA1 to enable cells to evade suicide in the presence of chemotherapy. The research that we have proposed will examine further the role of NFkB in enabling BRCA1 to allow cells to survive in the presence of DNA damage. We will investigate how BRCA1 turns on NFkB. The normal function of NFkB is to switch on the expression of a set of signature proteins which are able to inhibit the cells suicide pathway. We will look for expression of these signature proteins in the cells where NFkB is switched on in response to damage. 
The work proposed in this grant will be of significant value in the design of therapeutic strategies for the treatment of breast cancer. The design of specific inhibitors against target proteins turned on in this pathway should render the breast tumour cell significantly more susceptible to DNA damaging chemotherapy.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>We have previously reported using multiple cell line model systems that BRCA1 mediates resistance to a range of DNA damaging agents including etoposide, cisplatin and bleomycin. NFkB is a well-documented mediator of chemoresistance in response to DNA damaging agents. We examined the activation of NFkB by electromobility shift assay (EMSA) in BRCA1 deficient HCC-1937 cells that had been reconstituted with BRCA1 (HCC-BR) or empty vector (HCC-EV), following treatment with etoposide. There was a clear activation of NFkB in HCC-BR cells treated with etoposide compared to HCC-EV cells. Similarly we demonstrated that siRNA mediated inhibition of endogenous BRCA1 in T47D cells abrogated etoposide induced activation of NFkB as shown by EMSA and luciferase assays, where luciferase was placed under the control of an NFkB promoter. To investigate the consequences of NFkB activation on cell survival, NFkB was inhibited using either siRNA against the p65 subunit of NFkB, or with the chemical inhibitor BAY-7082. Treatment with either inhibitor caused a significant reduction in the survival of HCC-BR cells following etoposide treatment as shown by cell count experiments, however neither inhibitor had any effect on the survival of etoposide treated HCC-EV cells. Thus we conclude that the BRCA1 dependent activation of NFkB in response to DNA damage plays a significant role in mediating survival. 
The current proposal aims to further examine the role played by NFkB as a mediator of the BRCA1 induced resistance to DNA damage. Firstly we will determine if BRCA1 is a general mediator of NFkB activation in response to a range of DNA damaging chemotherapy. Secondly we aim to elucidate the mechanism by which BRCA1 modulates the activation of NFkB. Finally we seek to identify BRCA1 and NFkB regulated anti-apoptotic target genes, which may function to regulate the observed chemoresistant phenotype. To carry out these aims we will make use of the cell line models of BRCA1 deficiency described above. To identify novel transcriptional targets we will make use of microarray expression profiling. The results of this research will be of significant value in the development of theraupeutic strategies for overcoming the chemoresistance of BRCA1 expressing cells.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>288855</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5357007B-1392-436C-AB5C-E8DB73F1EF92</gtr:id><gtr:title>Profiling of the BRCA1 transcriptome through microarray and ChIP-chip analysis.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nucleic acids research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c36b222012acb03861b96f398c3518bb"><gtr:id>c36b222012acb03861b96f398c3518bb</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gorski JJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0305-1048</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>pm_14444_24_21880590</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>84498845-039E-4B4A-8484-6255A8B80960</gtr:id><gtr:title>BRCA1 is a key regulator of breast differentiation through activation of Notch signalling with implications for anti-endocrine treatment of breast cancers.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nucleic acids research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e1bbebd92a0d81ac71a64802f022f792"><gtr:id>e1bbebd92a0d81ac71a64802f022f792</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Buckley NE</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0305-1048</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>pm_14444_24_23863842</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>63CB4121-1D71-47EB-899B-09881163D8EE</gtr:id><gtr:title>The DeltaNp63 proteins are key allies of BRCA1 in the prevention of basal-like breast cancer.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Cancer research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e1bbebd92a0d81ac71a64802f022f792"><gtr:id>e1bbebd92a0d81ac71a64802f022f792</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Buckley NE</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0008-5472</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>pm_14444_24_21363924</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>23D6AD13-758D-4812-9462-562BFF6A8192</gtr:id><gtr:title>NF-?B is a critical mediator of BRCA1-induced chemoresistance.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Oncogene</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4ab4185149341b2cfacd7ac91476a8c8"><gtr:id>4ab4185149341b2cfacd7ac91476a8c8</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Harte MT</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0950-9232</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>pm_14444_24_23435429</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>FA918AA2-6FD2-4B55-9992-8FF51DF25D31</gtr:id><gtr:title>BRCA1 and GATA3 corepress FOXC1 to inhibit the pathogenesis of basal-like breast cancers.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Oncogene</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/30d297ccc387a2dc9334e45e7b775d51"><gtr:id>30d297ccc387a2dc9334e45e7b775d51</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Tkocz D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0950-9232</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>pm_14444_24_22120723</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">G0600267</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>7C58A707-1BF6-4573-A44F-30B271C80813</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cancer</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>8F896112-5A04-4A11-A9F0-2B446D9AAC8A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>5.1  Pharmaceuticals</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
