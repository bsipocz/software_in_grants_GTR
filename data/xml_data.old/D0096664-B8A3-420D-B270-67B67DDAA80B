The conversion of C-H bonds into new functional groups is a very desirable process due to its atom efficiency and retention of functional groups. An important area of modern research focuses on functionalisation of typically inert C-H bonds, such as the aromatic C(sp2)-H bond. Activation is typically achieved using a catalytic metal species. The vast majority of known aryl C-H activation strategies require substrates that fall into one of three categories: (1) arenes incorporating a directing group; (2) electron-rich arenes; (3) electron-poor arenes. Each strategy has limitations due to the need for covalently bound substituents on the aromatic ring. We propose a universal C-H activation method that requires no directing groups or covalently bound substituents. 

Our proposed method of C-H activation involves transient pi-coordination of an arene to a catalytic Ru(II) complex. The eta-6 bound arene is activatated towards C-H activation and subsequent arylation by a second metal catalyst. Once arylation has taken place, exchange between the bound arene and aryl starting material completes the catalytic cycle. 

Pi-coordination of aromatic compounds to Ru(II) is known to increase the reactivity of the bound species. For example, an increase in electrophilicity leads to nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) of eta-6 bound aryl chlorides, which are unreactive when not bound to Ru(II). Due to the inert metal arene bond, this reaction is usually stoichiometric in Ru(II). Recently, we described a catalytic SNAr process that operates via a pi-coordinated arene intermediate. In this proposal, we will use the increase in acidity of pi-coordinated arene C-H bonds to achieve C-H arylation via a concerted metalation-deprotonation mechanism. By controlling the rate of arene exchange, the reaction will be catalytic in Ru(II) complex, resulting in C-H activation of unfunctionalised arenes, such as benzene. The specific aims of the project are:

(1) To demonstrate C-H activation and arylation of eta-6 bound arene-Ru(II) complexes. Initially, the reaction will be stoichiometric in Ru(II).

(2) To carry out C-H activation of eta-6 bound arenes using catalytic quantities of Ru(II). The reaction will proceed via: (a) arene pi-coordination to Ru(II); (b) C-H activation and arylation; (c) arene exchange between eta-6 bound product and free arene starting material.

(3) To synthesise a Ru(II) complex that increases the rate of C-H arylation by accelerating the rate of arene exchange. From our preliminary results, it is established that arene exchange is the rate limiting process in related reactions and that Ru(II) complexes incorporating tethers that coordinates to Ru(II) during arene exchange accelerate the rate of exchange. 

This novel C-H activation methodology has the potential to be transformative in the field. No longer will directing groups or covalently bound substrate be required to achieve C-H activation. Beyond the scope of this one-year proposal, the approach in which transient pi-coordination increases the reactivity of an aromatic compound could be applied to other reactions of aromatic compounds, in which covalently bound electron withdrawing group are required.

The new synthetic methodology described in this project will be applicable to several areas of the chemical industry, including the pharmaceutical and materials chemistry industry.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The direct and immediate impact of this grant proposal will be the opportunity for the PI to launch his independent research career. The PDRA will develop research and professional skills, such as scientific writing, conference presentation and time-management, which will impact their future career path, whether it be in academia, industry or some other area. Undergraduate project students will also develop similar skills in presentation, independent study and scientific writing. Other direct impact will be the advancement of the UK and international C-H activation research field. We also envisage impact on other areas of catalytic research, as discussed in the academic beneficiaries section.

Our longer-term impact vision is for our novel C-H activation method to be used routinely by the chemical industry. The Suzuki-Miyaura reaction has become one of the most widely used reaction in the pharmaceutical industry, due to its simplicity and functional group tolerance. However, this reaction is less atom efficient than equivalent C-H coupling reactions. We see potential for our C-H activation protocol to replace the Suzuki-Miyaura reaction in the formation of biaryls in pharmaceutical products. This would have an impact on the UK economy as companies using our reaction will save money during synthesis and waste disposal. The knock-on effect will have a societal impact - if pharmaceutical companies can product drug candidates more cheaply, savings can be passed on to end-users such as the NHS, reducing the cost of healthcare in the UK. 

To realise this economical and societal impact, commercial exploitation and patents will be discussed with Durham Business and Innovation Service prior to publication. We will use the results of this EPSRC First Grant as preliminary data to seek industrial support for further development through, for example, the EPSRC iCASE awards. This will lead to commercial exploitation of catalytic reactions based on transient pi-coordination. The timescales of this impact pathway will be: filing of patents at the end of year 1; industrial collaboration through iCASE from years 2-5; commercialisation from year 5 onwards through partnership with industry.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>98563</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>70</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Travel Grant</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-04-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Royal Society of Chemistry</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>60A21FEF-DEE7-4622-9EAC-1EB1EECC9BE6</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c96a019c5dc7.64702720</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Learned Society</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-04-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>15000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Royal Society Research Fund</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>The Royal Society</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>3FDDEE19-A7B5-4EAA-A144-CA8D247695B7</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c9692b9e3221.69113573</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>This 12 month award was completed in Dec 2016. There have been several academic impacts as a result of the award. Firstly, Dr Luke Wilkinson, a research associate, who was funded through this award received valuable training in homogeneous catalysis, inert atmosphere Schlenk apparatus techniques and catalytic reaction development. Upon completion of this grant, Dr Wilkinson secured a 2 year research associate position at Imperial college, London, working with Prof. Nick Long.

The project has also developed academic impact in the form of 1 oral conference presentation (Dr James Walton) and 2 conference poster presentations (Dr Luke Wilkinson). Further academic impact is expected upon publication of our successful results (planned submission May 2017).

Further cultural and economic longer term impact include industrial collaboration to promote our new catalytic reaction into the industrial sector. We are currently investigating potential partners to achieve this aim.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>B2CAE288-D9E1-4809-9486-278C0F37A030</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>58c960ec75f775.05344086</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Chemicals</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The objectives of this award were to discover novel C-H activation protocol, which could be both stoichiometric or catalytic in Ru catalyst. We were successful in this and will publish our results in due course target submission is May 2017, once all work is written up (by Dr James Walton). Our successful reaction involved C-H activation of orthofluorotoluene bound to Ru in an eta-6 fashion. Catalytic activation is achieved using Pd(OAc)2, AgPF6 and CH2ClCH2Cl solvent. This important discover has the potential to be used in the industrial pharmaceutical synthesis of biaryls. We also developed some new inert atmosphere synthetic chemistry with the synthesis of several new [CpRu(arene)]+ complexes. 

In terms of future collaboration and partnerships, we established a link with Dr Joseph Bear (UCL), who spent a week in our laboratory to investigate nanoparticle systems, using our catalysts. We have also developed a connection with Dr Antoine Buchard, University of Bath, who is a computational chemist. On the back of this EPSRC award, we have submitted a UNESCO Green Chemistry award, which builds on the results of this successful grant and includes some computational investigations.

Finally, addition novel (unexpected) reactions have emerged during the course of this grant, which we will pursue over the coming 12 months, including submission of new grant proposals.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>There are several exciting future projects that have emerged as a result of this award.

As a result of this award, addition novel (unexpected) reactions have emerged. These include a deiodination reaction, using [Cp(NCMe)3]PF6 catalysts. My PhD and MChem students will carry this project forward to investigate the scope and application of this reaction. We will also prepare a new grant application in this area.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>F945950F-9B33-4D88-957B-EF68B74C43A5</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c96593559bb2.85195120</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://community.dur.ac.uk/james.walton/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F682C46B-0C46-49E6-B711-EB5161C97E89</gtr:id><gtr:title>Nucleophilic trifluoromethylation of electron-deficient arenes.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Chemical communications (Cambridge, England)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c060f0a013ecb634808bd0e28a9a3dc9"><gtr:id>c060f0a013ecb634808bd0e28a9a3dc9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pike JA</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1359-7345</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a2ff1008aef16.73032402</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E17C6EE6-083F-4DAA-98C1-349050B185F9</gtr:id><gtr:title>C-H Activation of p-Arene Ruthenium Complexes</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Organometallics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9c450255674dc0a6616e7a7b823433e9"><gtr:id>9c450255674dc0a6616e7a7b823433e9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wilkinson L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a2ff001814b93.86231139</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/N007441/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64596636-AE88-4F6E-A816-9C4C203E1197</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Catalysis &amp; surfaces</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>60EBB420-734E-4DB5-B0F2-65A1115A27F8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>70</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical synthesis</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>35E9CECD-F211-4914-9F91-4B8FB76B773D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Catalysis &amp; Applied Catalysis</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A097DA61-EABD-4142-9025-D4EA5CA63082</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>70</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Co-ordination Chemistry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
