Waste is a significant problem facing a rapidly urbanising world, with challenges at every stage including waste prevention, treatment/management, recycling and reuse, and the health and ecosystem impacts of poorly managed waste. Rising to these challenges, particularly in relation to sustainable cities, is high on the policy agenda at local, national and international levels. For example a recent (2013) UK Government report on waste noted that: We need to develop further the concept of a circular economy, where one person's waste becomes another's valuable resource...Making the changes needed may require innovation and creative thinking...

Aims and Objectives
The aim of the Network is to develop a forum for knowledge exchange and debate across art &amp;amp; humanities and science disciplines and subject areas with a common focus on waste treatment, management and innovation. This will seek to develop responses to the question: how can arts based approaches inform waste management innovation techniques and processes; and secondly, (how) does place (local context, identity, culture, governance) make a difference to waste generation, waste innovation delivery and uptake?

This aim will be met through the following objectives:
i)To establish an interdisciplinary network of Europe-wide academics, artists, scientists, practitioners, stakeholders, and interested end-users. We will run four workshops in 4 European cities (London, Amsterdam, Maastricht, Bangor in Wales) to explore and develop ideas, issues and possible solutions and learn from each other, and also run a number of 'pop-up' events piloting arts-based approaches to public engagement and waste. A 'wiki style' open source website will provide network support. 

ii) to identify particular sorts of waste (e.g. industrial/domestic, organic/manufactured, chemicals/metals, waste-energy, water) and to identify specific 'intervention points', which have good potential for creative interdisciplinary innovation.

Applications and Benefits
Bringing together different disciplines and different 'communities of place and practice' to address a common problem will have the primary benefit of structured knowledge exchange and capacity building across a number of divides (e.g. academic/practitioner, geographical, artists and scientists). The process of creating and participating in the network will therefore be its key outcome/benefit. The network will also make connections (through the pop up events and through the website) with 'the general public', enabling 'local and lay expertise' to inform the network. 

We aim to identify, through an iterative process of workshops and facilitated discussion, not only how 'good practice' in one area can be uptaken in another, but to identify what sorts of waste, and what sorts of 'intervention points', may be best suited for taking forward creative interdisciplinary solutions, and to seek future funding to develop these, ensuring a legacy for the network. We also anticipate a number of smaller 'spin off' innovations, which may be quite simple, such as better recycling leaflet design and event management. 

We aim for the long term benefits to be more sustainable waste management and treatment innovation systems and improved governance including citizen participation, enabling waste to be more sustainably treated and for more value to be extracted from waste streams. This would have clear benefits for the health, wealth and wellbeing of cities and their citizens.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research? 
1. Artists seeking to develop local and international academic, and stakeholder/practitioner, relationships to enable arts informed interdisciplinary innovation and citizen engagement in relation to waste specifically and sustainability more generally; 
2. Stakeholders and practitioners involved with the governance, management and treatment of waste, such as Local Authorities, NGOs and Social Enterprises, policy makers, local waste policy and practitioner agencies representatives; local/regional government, community partner and environmental groups; 
3. Businesses seeking to become more sustainable and innovative around waste management; 
4. Industries involved in waste management and treatment innovation; 
5. Citizens as producers of waste and responsible for its management as end users of systems, and as stakeholders, ie as taxpayers, residents, ecological citizens. 

How will they benefit from this research? 
This Research Network's key objective is to build interdisciplinary capacity and knowledge exchange across a number of divides (geographical, academic/ practitioner, art/science, governance), and to develop specific foci for specific innovations/ interventions to improve waste management, treatment and governance in cities. Long term benefits will be more sustainable waste management and treatment innovation systems and improved governance including citizen participation, enabling waste to be more sustainably treated and for more value to be extracted from waste streams. The long term benefits of improved waste management innovation have clear benefits for the health, wealth and wellbeing of cities and their citizens. City waste systems are stretched, creating social and environmental risks. There is significant financial value to be extracted from waste streams as well as the potential to reuse and recycle more trace elements which are unsustainable to extract as raw materials. This is a key policy agenda: a UK Gov report (2013) Prevention is better than cure: The role of waste prevention in moving to a more resource efficient economy noted: we need to make better and more efficient use of the increasingly valuable resources available to us... a world where substantially less waste is created across the economy, delivering real financial, environmental and social benefits. The challenges of waste management and treatment are faced by all of us as global citizens, particularly city dwellers, and the research beneficiaries identified above are tasked with addressing these challenges in different ways and at different scales, from local to global. 

Interim benefits for all key participants in the network (artists, scientists, policy makers, practitioners, stakeholders, businesses and industry, public citizens) who are already involved or potentially interested in the field of waste management/ treatment/ governance, will be the opportunity to become engaged in anongoing process of managed, structured, iterative knowledge exchange, through online networking and most importantly through the four city-based workshops and the associated public participative 'pop up' events. There will be a strong educational/ learning element, including wider public engagement, whereby &amp;quot;local/ lay knowledge&amp;quot; of citizens and practitioners, for example, can inform industrial innovators and policy makers. Knowledge exchange will enable significant capacity building which has its own value through informing the thinking and potential practice of different stakeholders; process as output. Capacity building around the role of the arts specifically in the waste innovation process is seen as a key benefit with the potential to inform current and future practice. Impacts are also anticipated in terms of identifying specific interdisciplinary innovations which can be developed into structured future funding applications (e.g. H2020) and other 'spin off' projects.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>37733</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>artwork created specifically for the project by Irene Janze as part of 'pop up' public engagement/site specific installation

Purpose: to use arts led methods to engage the public in thinking about waste. Outputs include the ongoing development of artwork co-produced with members of the public who engaged in the pop up. The arts pop up event was organised by Irene Janze, the creative director of the smARTcities project, collaborating with other artists in the network

Description from smARTcities artistic director Irene Janze:
Ariaan, Netty, myself and other apostates popped up at the Art boulevard in the Wertheimpark festival next to the Hortus in Amsterdam. Some people of the public made waste sculptures, some participated in project of Netty who invited the public in Dutch: &amp;quot;is er iets wat je aan niks en niemand kwijt wil? Neem plaats en vertel het me dan zal ik het vereeuwigen.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Tell me what you dont want to loose.&amp;quot; Again, a very different public in comparison with publics at other occasions passed us by. Over all the public overhere produced no longer or hardly any waste at all. They all sorted out their left overs and put them in different garbage bins. Conclusion from the public: waste has become a resource. But is this really the case? Do we know what happens with the waste in the garbage bins? And do we need more recycled plastic for instance? To add to the amount of plastic all ready existing? Or do we have to go for bioplastics? Is recycling an answer to the waste problems? Or do we have to produce differently or may be less? Here more about the plastic topic at the workshop on December 8, 2016 in Maastricht Talking with the public people with young childeren expressed their concern about the plastic bubble.As have I. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKNJyKyfL9g&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be .Buro jan-ZE, footage A.van Walsum, movie Irene Janze</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58a59da14a8a67.37211336</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://smartcitiesandwaste.com/doku.php?id=public_engagement#pop_pop-_up_4_july_3_2016_art_boulevard_wertheim_park_amsterdam</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Maastricht Interdisciplinary workshop (2nd project workshop).</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>367527F6-7732-4546-A3AF-1C595A20E2BF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>the second smARTcities interdisciplinary worskhop held at the Van Eyck Academy, Maastricht on 9.12.16.
title:

As with the first pop up, the aim was to creatively engage the public in conversations about waste, through interaction with pop up arts installations. Approximately 100 people were engaged with in two locations in the city suburbs; a middle class district, and a low income, ethnic district. 

Videos of the events and feedback from Irene Janze (blogs and photos) are in the process of being digitally archived on the project website. Overviews of pop ups 1) and 2) were provided at the Amsterdam workshop held on 28th April. Artistic outputs generated by the pop ups continue to be developed and the methodology refined for future roll out.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5732075f2307f5.75050419</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://smartcitiesandwaste.com/doku.php?id=public_engagement</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Amsterdam pop up5)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E3F54A26-2B9E-45CB-85E3-46CADAD08880</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Pop- up 5, September 11, 2016 the Temple of Wasted Idols ( de tempel der Afvalgoden) , zeeburgerdijk 122 Amsterdam

Irene Janze and several of the artists participating in the Amsterdam workshop are an artist collective known as Buro jan-ZE. For the final Amsterdam smARTcities and waste pop up, Buro jan-ZE made an exhibition for the smARTcities and waste in an old building, Zeeburgerdijk 112 in Amsterdam in where Buro jan_ZE temporarily rents a studio. The Exhibition was open during the &amp;quot;Open studios Centrum-oost&amp;quot;, 21st-22nd May2016. Occasionally performances /participatory events, were also held for people visiting the gallery. This final event was a culmination of themes and artwork developed by Irene Janze , Netty Gelijsteen and the other artists involved in Buro jan-ZE- Maria Louisa Vandenput, Ida Voorthuis and Ariaan van Walsum, most of whom also actively participated in the smARTcities Amsterdam workshop held on April 28th 2016 and indeed have been part of the delivery of previous pop ups. It is fascinating to see how these artists are working with, and critically exploring, the concept of &amp;quot;waste&amp;quot;, and it is exciting to see how the workshop itself has been part of the &amp;quot;incubation period&amp;quot; of developing ideas. So there is a back-and forth- dialogue here, which is also involving the public's perspective, through these &amp;quot;open source&amp;quot;, pop up, participatory practices.

Irene has written a PDF report, available here,reportexpo_zeeburgerdijk.pdf which is a fantastic,colourful and insightful record of this final exhibition. She notes that:

The exhibition is of course not intended as illustrations or explanations of scientific and/or technological waste innovations. It is certainly not my intention to reduce the artworks and performances as suchIn Amsterdam the focus of the smARTcities and waste meeting was and is on buildings, cities, matter, skins and bodies. We have tried to address those issues raised in the workshop at the VU in a poetic and/or artistic way

Purpose: to use arts led methods to engage the public in thinking about waste. Outputs include the ongoing development of artwork co-produced with members of the public who engaged in the pop up. The arts pop up event was organised by Irene Janze, the creative director of the smARTcities project, collaborating with the local artist Netty Gelijsteen.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5731fc5e49de27.45351352</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClQbXcyFk-8VKWXU03UC6ew</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Amsterdam interdisciplinary workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1A123E18-582D-4A35-81F1-74AC0733C5B3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>25 people, mostly based in Amsterdam, (with the PI and co-I also attending) and representing a range of disciplines and practices (artists, scientists, local policy makers, students, humanities and social scientist academics, third sector organisations and local political parties), participated in the first smARTcities and waste arts-led interdisciplinary workshop, held at VU Free University, Amsterdam, April 28th 2016. 

The theme of the day was [waste, innovation and] Buildings, place(s), and space(s). The day consisted of interdisciplinary speakers, and participatory, faciliated deliberation (World cafe) around key discussion topics relating to the overall theme of the workshop and the aims of the network. Participants also brought along their own artwork and also participated in an interactive arts session, continuing the work of the arts pop up events also undertaken as public engagement initiatives as part of the network's capacity development and knowledge exchange remit.

The world cafe discussion notes, Photos, blogs, social media (twitter, project website) , videos and presentation slides are amongst the initial outputs from this event which are being digitally archived currently. A workshop report will also be forthcoming and will be webmounted and circulated to participants.

This is an iterative process of capaicty building and knowledge exchange across time and the findings and outputs from this event will inform the next workshop to be held Winter 2016. There has also been positive feedback from participants in the workshop and social media interest through twitter.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5732036e161b59.73996103</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://smartcitiesandwaste.com/doku.php?id=amsterdam</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>this is an ongoing project so key findings relating to this research network are 'work in progress'.
Key Findings:
the methodologies being trialled for interdisciplinary knowledge exchange and capacity building are being shown to be effective; the workshops are popular, well attended, lively and have a strong interdisciplinary narrative and coherence relating to waste innovation. Different disciplines and different 'communities of practice' are informing each other and the network is continuing to grow and develop.

Arts-led approaches to interdisciplinary knowledge exchange are being shown to be particularly effective in opening up 'third space'; faciliating lateral thinking and a willingness to explore and engage. Further- Examples of arts-led approaches, for example for innovative public engagement purposes, have inspired workshop participants; for example policy makers seeking to engage publics in recycling initiatives.

&amp;quot;waste&amp;quot; as a &amp;quot;boundary object&amp;quot; dense in meaning and value(s) has easily generated interdisciplinary and cross-practice engagement across a number of divides 

The methodologies trialled for arts-led public engagement, namely artistic site specific 'pop ups' have been successful and have generated significant involvement from artists in the network at no additional costs to the project (free time given by artists involved). They have also successfully engaged the public and generated insights which are informing the development of the network.

A number of issues and themes have been identified as being of particular interest in the context of stimulating interdiscplinary innovation in the context of waste. These include the concept of &amp;quot;tipping points&amp;quot; ; and the experimental use of materials as 'common ground' between artists and scientists. More conceptually, the links between waste and value(s) have been explored: we have identified that &amp;quot;When an object has no value it is seen as waste. But waste is also dense in meaning and value(s)&amp;quot;. (Alex Plows, blog post).

While &amp;quot;science communication&amp;quot; per se is not the main objective of the network, the workshops are definitely fulfilling this function and providing scientists with means to communicate their research to different disciplines and publics.

A number of themes and ideas associated with these issues and findings continue to inform the development of the network as we move into the second and final year.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Use of methods described above- for 'best practice' interdisciplinary knowledge exchange and public engagement
