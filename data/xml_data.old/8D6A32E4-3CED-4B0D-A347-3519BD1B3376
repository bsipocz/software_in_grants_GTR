Exchange</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/J005150/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This unique consortium draws on the research excellence of interdisciplinary and complementary design innovation labs at three universities - Lancaster University, Newcastle University and the Royal College of Art and connects it with public and private sectors, linking large and small-scale businesses, service providers and citizens. Together, our expertise in developing and applying creative techniques to navigate unexplored challenges includes that of designers, artists, curators, producers, broadcasters, engineers, managers, technologists and writers - and draws on wider expertise from across the partner universities and beyond.

The Creative Exchange responds to profound changes in practice in the creative and media-based industries stimulated by the opening of the digital public space, the ability of everyone to access, explore and create in any aspect of the digital space, moving from 'content consumption' to 'content experience'. It explores new forms of engagement and exchange in the broadcast, performing and visual arts, digital media, design and gaming sectors, by focusing on citizen-led content, interactive narrative, radical personalization and new forms of value creation in the context of the 'experience economy'. The primary geographic focus is the Northwest of England centred around the opportunity presented by the growth of MediaCityUK and its surrounding economy. The three universities act as local test beds with field trials in London, Lancaster and Newcastle prior to larger public facing trials in the northwest. This will support the North West regional strategy for growth in digital and creative media industries, whilst generating comparative research and development locally, nationally and internationally.

The Creative Exchange has been developed in response to a paradigm shift in content creation and modes of distribution in a digitally connected world, which has profound impact for the arts and humanities. This transformational-change is taking place within the landscape of a growing digital public space that includes archives, data, information and content. How we navigate and experience this space - and how we generate content for and within it - is central to how we create economic, social, cultural and personal value. The Hub draws on new and agile approaches to knowledge exchange for the creative economy that have been previously developed by the partner universities and new ones co-developed with specialist arts organizations, sector organizations and communities of users.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This hubs will explore new forms of engagement and exchange in the broadcast, performing &amp;amp; visual arts, digital media, design and gaming sectors. Many of whom will be located in the Northwest of England around the opportunity presented by the growth of Media City and it surrounding economy. However as the three universities will act as local test beds prior to public facing trials in the northwest and therefore beneficiary companies will also be located in NorthEast and London.

Through literature, individual company engagement and our pre-bid workshop in Manchester we have identified wide ranging business/organisational research and skills needs, ranging from:
1 Understanding citizen empowerment, how to operate in an experience economy, how to upskill for the digital environment especially in Northwest and MediaCity (NWDA (2008),Skills Set(2010) 
2 Understanding 'how an avalanche of technology will deliver opportunities as well as threats' 'to explore how to avoid inequality of access' 'Arts understanding of the audience and how to create experiences using technology', 'how to increase citizen engagement both physically and digitally' 'how to understand human responses, psychology and legal and ethical issues' Sample from Workshop 25 June.
3 Exploring the opportunities presented by the digital public space, and to explore access issues, enable business to experiment, to prototype experiences in the real world, understand the creative context for data driven experiences, broker new forms of co-design develop new services that go beyond crowd sources, (partners) 
 
Therefore a wide range of partners have been recruited to develop the Hub. These include a Lead partner, BBC. Large corporates (e.g Miscrosoft) Public Sector (e.g. Manchester City Council, Lancashire City Council); connecting/portal bodies (e.g Sharp, Creative Lancashire); and SME's Creative Concern, Stardotstar.
The Creative Exchange Hub's proposed knowledge exchange activities responds to these needs and impacts on the target sectors through:
i) Identifying shared concerns, skills needs and emerging trends and themes of interest and concern to partner companies through the curate activity 
ii) Brokering connections between organisations and businesses to identify project, research requirements and KE and facilitating exchange of leading edge academic research, sharing insights and trends through the connect activity
iii) Facilitating new collaborations around new services and products generated through co-creation and design experiments, enabling scaling-up of micro-enterprises and SMEs and opening up new demonstration and live testing opportunities, and thus enable new entrepreneurial activities around new services and products, through the intervention activity
iv) Introducing new knowledge and access to new arts and humanities researchers during the resource activity
v) Enabling citizen and community engagement via participation in events, co-design, rapid prototyping and testing, investigating appropriate, usable, personal and meaningful services that lead to new business proposition, through field trials.
iv)Developing toolkits for creative KE mechanisms for exploitation beyond the hub and into other sectors such as health and transport, and other disciplines e.g Law or Philosophy
v) Disseminating to a broader industry audience through industry facing conferences both the KE activities and mechanisms

The KE Hub will identify and attract additional partners into the the Hub through an energetic communication campaign, through the hub council and partners support and communication of successful activities, dissemination of the work through the conferences and field trials, and through the allied activities of the Highwire CDT, SIDE Digital Hub and RCA Helen Hamlyn Centre and our intermediary partners such as Sharp and Creative Lancashire. All of which enables us to expand the hub, its impact and its sustainability.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-01-09</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>4042323</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This research re-imagines the mix-tape for digital content as physical customizable jewellery that can once again embody values not generally attributed to digital content.

Anyone can simply call a landline or mobile from the phone by dialling the desired number. People with inclusive mobile phone plans are invited to donate some of their free minutes by connecting to the NoPayPhone as a bluetooth handset. Each call is randomly routed through one of the nearby donor phones. By donating free minutes you are helping to build an open, ad-hoc community resource. By virtually lending your mobile to strangers you are also adding unknown calls to your mobile phone bill. NoPayPhone explores the notion of phone boxes as a symbol of privacy, and helps to confuse targeted advertising and profiling by your mobile phone operator and any third-party surveillance of call metadata.

Hidden by a lovely veneer, Chattr participants adventured into dystopian space, a caf&amp;eacute; governed by social media rules, in which they had to negotiate unknown boundaries between physical - digital, private - public, live - archived, local - global.

At a first glance Chattr might look as an access restricted area, conversely Chattr was presented as the utterly public environment. Under the slogan 'your privacy is very important to us', Chattr provided a temporary hybrid space in which participants could kick back and enjoy a coffee while sharing their chats with an online community.

Chattr mirrored the Terms of Service of social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn. By choosing to access Chattr lounge, participants accepted the Data Use Policy, which required them to carry a recording device within Chattr confines. All spoken conversations would then be recorded, transcribed and archived in a publicly accessible database that shall remain permanently in a public space online. Thus, Chattr's operational model relayed on the generation of an archive of popular culture as a by-product of participant's social interactions within the caf&amp;eacute;.

Chattr is conceived following the operational model of digital social networks, providing a service in exchange for participant's privacy, aiming to build up a publicly accessible archive of private conversations.</gtr:description><gtr:id>3FC71B17-5AF6-462D-95A3-F7CF1D0F1FE2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>FutureEverything, Manchester with 500 attendees</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d8749bd51811.64353253</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Chattr (FutureEverything)</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artwork</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Music video by Cape Town hip hop artist</gtr:description><gtr:id>715AB183-6835-4BA5-8F50-7A9085BEA7C6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Over 5,000 YouTube views across the 5 videos</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dd6274968975.69033443</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Cinehack Music Video - Sterk op Hede by Die Skerpste Lem</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.cinehack.com/cinehack-cape-town/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Produced in collaboration with The Dementia Innovation Hub and the British Transport Police (BTP); a YouTube video campaign to raise awareness of Dementia Friendly stations.</gtr:description><gtr:id>EE1CD1EB-3264-415E-862B-73915F7E49FC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>http://www.ncl.ac.uk/press/news/2015/11/dementiafriendlystations/</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dc19599c60e4.64458394</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Dementia-Friendly Train Stations</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.ncl.ac.uk/press/news/2015/11/dementiafriendlystations/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>CX co-working space, as part of the 'Hybrid Lives' project, which reveals the social relations at work, through interactive tables which measure and display bandwidth usage, and video works which blend live images of current and historical work.</gtr:description><gtr:id>225159C4-8240-4DAB-9307-C488B88FE2AF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Hybrid Lives was a freely accessible co-working space used by over 1,000 people during the run of the FACT exhibition Time and Motion.

Swaythe Band is designed to help participants sway to the music by illustrating a song's tempo. Players (or members of our band) are given a PlayStation Move controller (or baton). During a song, participants hold the controller as the LED light at its top changes colour in time to the beat of the music. The controllers are connected to a central computer via Bluetooth (using the PS Move API ) which dictates the colour and timing. This configuration is able to support up to eight participants with the computer being additionally responsible for playing the music.

In the example presented at Create4Dementia, the timing of the lights was hardcoded to accompany &amp;quot;The Shrimp Boats&amp;quot;, a song by Jo Stafford (1951).

In the versions post Create4Dementia Swaytheband is fully configurable allowing different beats and tunes to be created. This is done via the XML file which is read by the program as it loads.

Swaythe Band is more than just its software outputs. It's important to note how we used the PlayStation controllers. There were treated (and called) batons during the experience and given a rope textured handle, drawing inspiration from the trawling nets on the 'shrimp boats'. This made them easy to hold, pleasing to look at, and soft, should they be dropped. Correspondingly we also decided on the colour of the controllers should be the colour (Little Greene Shrimp Pink / #f7c7a9) when resting.</gtr:description><gtr:id>A2F6725E-B41B-44CB-9DC4-53C49DBC1A69</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Swaythe Band won Best Project at the Create 4 Dementia hackathon at the Great North Museum, Newcastle-Upon-Tyne.

Swaythe Band has been trialed in a care home in Ireland where residents have used it to augment their enjoyment of music sessions in the home. As well as the importance of this digital prototype to the home, Kellie Morrissey has made this one of the main outputs of her PhD and will discuss this in her upcoming DIS 2016 paper (subject to peer review).

Through numerous local, national and international performances the piece has been presented to over 400 people and opened up conversations and collaborations between various individuals, organisations and institutions. Notably examples include: Magnus Williamson from ICMUS, Fort Process in Brighton and the NewBridge Project, Newcastle.
This is a first performance of its kind, I know of no other performance piece utilising mobile technology for this method of sound diffusion. In early 2015 the system will be open sourced and available for other sound artists and musicians to ultilise. Fields has recently received support from UK commissioners Sound and Music to engage new audiences through a 5-date tour across 2015. 
Fields has been performend at the following events:

Sounds &amp;amp; Guts is engaged in developing new ways in which to work collaboratively with a range of partners who contribute to dialogue around current social, political and ontological issues. As a collaborative project it creates a space in which people can reflect upon their own experiences of particular issue and form opinions or change behaviors in relation to this issue. As an ongoing project Sounds &amp;amp; Guts will go on to experiment with a range of participatory approaches to engaging people with the issue of loneliness through performance making. 

The project resulted in partnerships between a number of individuals, organisations and institutions, including; Queens Hall Arts Centre (Hexham), Live Theatre (Newcastle), The Pacitti Company, residents of Holy Island, Dr. Laura Cull (Surrey University), Northumberland Council, Arts Council England and a number of artists and researchers who were involved in making the performance including Taryn Edmonds (film), Matthew Evans (theatre director), Emma Beverly (theatre producer) and Tim Shaw (sound). These partnerships are ongoing and will underpin Phase 2 of Sounds &amp;amp; Guts

A total of 9 Performances of Sounds &amp;amp; Guts were presented at the following venues; Queens Hall Arts Centre (Hexham), Live Theatre (Newcastle), St Cuthbert's Centre (Holy Island) and SPILL Festival (Ipswich) between September 17th - November 2nd. The total audience attending these performances was 249. The installation was presented in the Ipswich Art School Gallery venue at SPILL Festival, engaging approximately 200 people.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>546380240fe901.61662674</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Sounds &amp; Guts - Tess Denman-Cleaver</gtr:title><gtr:type>Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.tenderbuttons.co.uk/project/sounds-guts/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>As part of a collaboration with Gabriella Arrigoni, participants during an exhibition at FACT Liverpool were able to generate and 3D print personalised fingerprint shapes from stories they've imagined as part of a forensic engagement activity.</gtr:description><gtr:id>522FE38D-D04E-4EA7-BE90-CB2A8F1497B6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Impact for this artefact is described in the associated engagement event (Fabricating FACTs)</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56db806a722250.17316181</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Fabricating FACTs fingerprints</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artefact (including digital)</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://makingdatathings.wordpress.com/2015/02/05/fabricating-facts-3/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The digital scarecrow is the result of a participatory design exercise with children from the village who created drawings that were used to inspire the final scarecrow design.</gtr:description><gtr:id>528DAD75-2A4E-4E04-A4BA-85626F032D91</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This output formed part of The Creative Exchange, a broad programme of activities with notable impact in multiple areas.

It is composed entirely of user-generated content from diverse and geographically separated conservation communities across the UK. It features a variety of video, image, sound and text-based content, representing contributions from &amp;gt;40 individuals.

A unique, dynamically generated introduction sequence (composed entirely from the user-generated content) sets the scene for the documentary and also introduces a suite of interactive navigational tools that help audiences explore and create their own interpretations of the content.

Rather than being a 'standalone' artefact, Red Tales integrates with existing ecologies, both online (via social media) and offline (via different co-located communities). Users can 'curate' and share collections of existing content, as well as add new content to a &amp;quot;living&amp;quot; documentary. Our aim was to reflect the heterogeneity of the content and the 'unresolved' nature of the topic. Thus, rather than presenting a linear narrative, audiences are invited to explore and contribute to the documentary through a technical framework and an interaction paradigm that builds equally upon recent research in documentary/media studies and human-computer interaction, and pioneering interactive documentaries (eg Bear71 / 18 Days in Egypt). 

Red Tales was produced through participatory workshops and developed in response to an ethnographic study of the community that revealed its inherent diversity, several shared concerns and hundreds of individuals' stories. In making the film, we adopted a collaborative, multidisciplinary and participatory approach and we have drawn upon - and hope to contribute new to knowledge to - the AHRC's digital-economy and knowledge-exchange programmes. 

Through making this film, we have gained unique insights into knowledge exchange methods that bridge the worlds of academia, industry and the voluntary/charity sectors and the role digital technology can play in forging new experiences, supporting grassroots communities and producing non-linear documentary narratives.</gtr:description><gtr:id>59B953F2-2224-4614-A444-EE0E45D7AE73</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Several articles in the mainstream press</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dc187d312681.11386387</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Red Tales iDoc</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.redtales.co.uk</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>We asked 16 researchers to respond to the question: &amp;quot;What is the digital public space?&amp;quot;

Project R-hythm culminated in 1 performance event that hosted a total of 18 people who took part in the performance walk. The audience were aged between 4 - 77yrs of age. 

The project supported the formation of a number of partnerships which house ongoing conversations regarding participatory practices and performance as a collaborative research tool.

The suitcases support face-to-face and mediated encounters and the valorization of existing relations within a locality. The design of the suitcases emphasise choice and reciprocity through a process of 'asking' and 'giving', formulating questions to inspire story telling and nominating people to hand a suitcase to. With their thoughtful material design, travelling suitcases are specifically designed to draw people in reflective processes and engage with fellow citizens' personal narratives and perspectives.

The suitcases technical system was chosen to make the system as accessible as possible-tailored for low media and digital literacy skills, and to upload media content online in areas where there is very low or inexistent wi-fi network and accessibility. For this reason an Interactive Voice Responsive system was chosen. The suitcase comprised a GSM phone in a 3D printed case, which allowed the recoding and uploading of media content online without the need for an internet connection. Suitcase comes with its associated webpage where all content can be accessed (and curate it). 

Process 
A 'Travelling Suitcase' is given to a citizen who is prompted to record a story s/he wants to share with others. Then the citizen is invited to pick an envelope and write something about the story recorded and added it to the top of the suitcase. S/he is then prompted to choose someone else to hand the suitcase to and formulate a question to inspire storytelling. In this way the suitcase travels person to person till the last envelope that prompts to handing the suitcase back to the initiator of the process.

Technical system 
For the purpose of building a robust, sustainable (in terms of monetary costs and technical expertise needed to use and maintain it) and reliable system for the collection of place-related stories and their community dissemination an IVR system was designed and developed. A number of communications frameworks have been reviewed for this (including asterisk and freeswitch) but for the purpose of this project a more reliable and quick solution was chosen - an already running cloud communications service (e.g. twilio.com and nexmo.com). One ten digit number was purchased per suitcase; each call is redirected to an Apache server (on an Ubuntu installation hosted at digitalocean.com/) where a PHP script serves a VoiceXML file with instructions of how the call should be handled (menu options, voice clips etc.); if the user chooses to record a message the story is being recorded and stored on the server; if the user chooses to listen to a message, a random (or sorted) story is being fetched by the server and played back to the user; the messages can be accessed by either calling the equivalent phone number or visiting erithwalks.co.uk.</gtr:description><gtr:id>E2006BD3-6A44-479E-B02F-A3B3F6965339</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The residents and the housing institution were able to collect and distribute place-based stories about the multiple practices and values in and about their estate undergoing urban regeneration.

We propose an extension of this model, whereby the existing partners in TILO are considered similar to the partners within a standard cluster project and we propose two of the existing CX postgraduate researchers are allocated to the project alongside an academic, with Professor Rachel Cooper as a research sponsor and mentor and Dr Andrew Quick as the lead academic.

Whereas the standard CX cluster consists of short, intense research projects running for a few months. We propose a longitudinal approach, whereby postgraduate researchers would be allocated for the 12-month lifecycle of the project at 20%. These researchers would be allocated in kind alongside a budgeted academic (Dr Quick). 

The IOCP are primarily researching the psychological and physiological reaction to the direct experience of interacting with TILO and its affect on brand perception and the locus of control. The CX research would be focused more on evaluating the Arts and cultural sector significance of the results and the strategic organizational opportunities. The emphasis would be on locating the research results within other related digital arts projects, disseminating the information within the arts community and looking at the potential and actual artistic and cultural impact.

The residents would like to create walks around the year to establish a connection with new residents and between the past and future of the area. Clara made several visits to Erith Park to build relationships with residents, run participatory workshops, and co-design the digital walking.

As that was very low (2 days per company), a lot of the work fell to Phds to undertake as we had to manage the company input very strategically. 

Because Alpha set out to influence and change something that wasn't within any of our remits it was challenging to actually achive the grand aim of fixing procurement, however we did achieve the majority of our research aims as scoped for the first phase. 

We achieved an empirical review of 'good' procurement from the reports and literature, we mapped out the landscape and factors of influence on Procurement within the BBC, we plotted and assessed the impact of previous intervention within the system and devised tools to measure procurement effectiveness and how the experience lined up with company strategy. 

Bringing together this learning, we recognized that a toolkit or report would not have the influence on the area that we liked and instead we formed 'the ministry of good procurement' which brought together our learning into a manifesto of good procurement and seeks to champion 'good procurement' using more guerilla tactics.
Throughout the project our partners, both academic and comoany were meeting with people creating policy and procurement guidelines. We fed some findings to them directly as we went, but largey the experience and relationship with them led to us considering alternative approaches to disseminate our findings as they said they were overrun with reports and toolkits.

The project and our approach was influential on developing networks between CX and Helsinki, supported by PROUD, Emma Murphy ran a Masterclass featuring the Alpha approach to mapping the Factors of Influence, our findings and recommendations on empathy and our Manifesto with Jussi in Helsiki. 

The Ministry for Good procurement and its associated brand collateral has great potential for impact but requires a full website building and a system so that users can sign up to the manifesto for good procurement and also input their thoughts. We are discussing bringing both the ministry and the Helsinki model of procurement to fieldtrial or a second stage project with FutureGov. That would secure significant impact on the highly complex landscape of procurement.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>546c717e2301a5.27397380-4</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>University of Dundee:

The States of Mind device was produced in parallel with the design of the FACT Liverpool 2015 'Group Therapy: mental distress in a digital age' exhibition in which it was initially presented. A drop-in workshop 'Mapping the emotional landscape of Liverpool' was held during the exhibition, at which museum visitors and workshop participants were invited to talk about their individual journeys to the exhibition, using tangible and tactile rapid-prototyped versions of the digital 3D objects to reflect on their personal mental wellbeing. The States of Mind device was technically enhanced and featured in the 2015 London Design Festival. Across both events over 2,900 digital representations of people's states of mind were collected and shared using the TILO digital display system at FACT Liverpool and social media.

This is a whole new way to experience and make sense of the pulse of the Olympic Games.

Emoto captures and visualises the global response around the London 2012 Olympic Games on Twitter in an interactive online visualisation and physical data sculpture. As events unfold, emoto processes global twitter data and analyses the messages for content and emotional tone, which is then fed back to the viewer providing greater insight in real-time. After the Games, a physical data sculpture at the Cultural Olympiad closing event provides a truly unique interactive archive of the online response to London 2012.

Based on analysis of approx. 12.5 million Twitter messages, emoto presented both the big picture, the world from above, as well as the intimate and personal details enabling the viewer to zoom right in to specific detail. The dynamic nature of evolving news stories within the Olympic Games could be followed online via emoto, providing greater insight in real-time and an alternative perspective to that found in standard (eg TV) sport media coverage, or in the live experience for fans.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Goldsmiths, University of London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Near Miss</gtr:description><gtr:id>53971228-8FA6-47BD-BD17-252C029B9B84</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In progress</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>546c80f42be6b1.09576814-4</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>?

FACT provided access to a large public audience, creative consultation, local knowledge and premises to work in Liverpool. FACT also have strong links with local SMEs who were a target audience for this collaborative work. Stefan Kazassoglou, via his micro-SME Kinicho, brought expertise in 
contemporary sound diffusion technologies and access to a state of the art spatialised sound system - an array of 20 loudspeakers and associated software enabling the creation of immersive third order ambisonic spaces. During the project, Stefan constructed a larger version of his sound system (that was used to present work and stimulate new work) and made several impulse response recordings ('acoustic snapshots') of the locations used (also used as materials in the subsequent creative work). Dr. Magnus Williamson (Newcastle University) brought musicological expertise in European liturgical practices and institutional contexts, 1350-1650, and in the interaction between musical forms, books, ensembles and spaces; he also has brought interests in the role of sound in animating public encounters with lost or 'disappeared' spaces. 
Magnus contributed to critical reflections on the value of the collaborative work (both in Liverpool and in 'disappeared heritage spaces') throughout the project, and is developing further work with CX collaborators as a result.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>'Sound Spaces' was a practical and creative exploration of the potential of spatialised (&amp;quot;3-D&amp;quot;) sound through the making of spatialised sound environments that creatively respond to and gain perspectives on how we experience the urban environment. The project unpacked various elements of what the city is, how it might be (re)imagined as 'disappeared' or non-existent spaces and how it could be explored through sonic environments as material (Ingold, 2013). Through public and SME participation, the project also investigated how SMEs might incorporate spatialised sound in their own creative, technical and public engagement activities. The project was focussed on the city of Liverpool beginning with a four-day public making workshop as part of FACT Liverpool's Build Your Own: Tools for Sharing exhibition programme. During this workshop, participants explored the use of spatialised sound by, for example, creating a fictional map of Liverpool based on the sonic affinities of places within the city ('Soundlines' - one part leyline, one part songline). The workshop also explored the use of inexpensive, self-made technology and sophisticated ambisonic systems (Kinicho) for the creation of digitally spatialised sound environments. CX researchers facilitated the four-day workshop and a later week-long exhibition/residency at FACT. In these activities, CX researchers produced creative work in collaboration with partners and members of the public, and individually, bringing expertise in creative practice and practice-led research.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Edinburgh College of Art (ECA)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>School of Design</gtr:department><gtr:description>This is How We Do It</gtr:description><gtr:id>ADC22DB5-A697-4B4E-BB51-8143A4E2590E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Publication outputs from TIHWDI:

The RSA has pioneered the use of offline social network analysis as a means of achieving social policy outcomes by analysing people's social relationships and seeing how they impact on wellbeing, life satisfaction and other life outcomes. However, this approach is resource intensive; the LocalNets tool automated the process of community asset discovery to help community-focused organisations identify and understand community concerns and issues more efficiently.

Because Alpha set out to influence and change something that wasn't within any of our remits it was challenging to actually achive the grand aim of fixing procurement, however we did achieve the majority of our research aims as scoped for the first phase. 

We achieved an empirical review of 'good' procurement from the reports and literature, we mapped out the landscape and factors of influence on Procurement within the BBC, we plotted and assessed the impact of previous intervention within the system and devised tools to measure procurement effectiveness and how the experience lined up with company strategy. 

Bringing together this learning, we recognized that a toolkit or report would not have the influence on the area that we liked and instead we formed 'the ministry of good procurement' which brought together our learning into a manifesto of good procurement and seeks to champion 'good procurement' using more guerilla tactics.
Throughout the project our partners, both academic and comoany were meeting with people creating policy and procurement guidelines. We fed some findings to them directly as we went, but largey the experience and relationship with them led to us considering alternative approaches to disseminate our findings as they said they were overrun with reports and toolkits.

The project and our approach was influential on developing networks between CX and Helsinki, supported by PROUD, Emma Murphy ran a Masterclass featuring the Alpha approach to mapping the Factors of Influence, our findings and recommendations on empathy and our Manifesto with Jussi in Helsiki. 

The Ministry for Good procurement and its associated brand collateral has great potential for impact but requires a full website building and a system so that users can sign up to the manifesto for good procurement and also input their thoughts.

This is a whole new way to experience and make sense of the pulse of the Olympic Games.

Emoto captures and visualises the global response around the London 2012 Olympic Games on Twitter in an interactive online visualisation and physical data sculpture. As events unfold, emoto processes global twitter data and analyses the messages for content and emotional tone, which is then fed back to the viewer providing greater insight in real-time. After the Games, a physical data sculpture at the Cultural Olympiad closing event provides a truly unique interactive archive of the online response to London 2012.

Based on analysis of approx. 12.5 million Twitter messages, emoto presented both the big picture, the world from above, as well as the intimate and personal details enabling the viewer to zoom right in to specific detail. The dynamic nature of evolving news stories within the Olympic Games could be followed online via emoto, providing greater insight in real-time and an alternative perspective to that found in standard (eg TV) sport media coverage, or in the live experience for fans.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Infonomics Ltd</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Alpha Procurement</gtr:description><gtr:id>38D82A13-E646-4201-A7E8-FBEF61CDA3E0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Reining back our projected outputs and aims somewhat, we achieved a lot within the time allocated. As that was very low (2 days per company), a lot of the work fell to Phds to undertake as we had to manage the company input very strategically. 

Because Alpha set out to influence and change something that wasn't within any of our remits it was challenging to actually achive the grand aim of fixing procurement, however we did achieve the majority of our research aims as scoped for the first phase. 

We achieved an empirical review of 'good' procurement from the reports and literature, we mapped out the landscape and factors of influence on Procurement within the BBC, we plotted and assessed the impact of previous intervention within the system and devised tools to measure procurement effectiveness and how the experience lined up with company strategy. 

Bringing together this learning, we recognized that a toolkit or report would not have the influence on the area that we liked and instead we formed 'the ministry of good procurement' which brought together our learning into a manifesto of good procurement and seeks to champion 'good procurement' using more guerilla tactics.
Throughout the project our partners, both academic and comoany were meeting with people creating policy and procurement guidelines. We fed some findings to them directly as we went, but largey the experience and relationship with them led to us considering alternative approaches to disseminate our findings as they said they were overrun with reports and toolkits.

The project and our approach was influential on developing networks between CX and Helsinki, supported by PROUD, Emma Murphy ran a Masterclass featuring the Alpha approach to mapping the Factors of Influence, our findings and recommendations on empathy and our Manifesto with Jussi in Helsiki. 

The Ministry for Good procurement and its associated brand collateral has great potential for impact but requires a full website building and a system so that users can sign up to the manifesto for good procurement and also input their thoughts. We are discussing bringing both the ministry and the Helsinki model of procurement to fieldtrial or a second stage project with FutureGov. That would secure significant impact on the highly complex landscape of procurement.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>546c717e2301a5.27397380-3</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>University of Dundee:

As that was very low (2 days per company), a lot of the work fell to Phds to undertake as we had to manage the company input very strategically. 

Because Alpha set out to influence and change something that wasn't within any of our remits it was challenging to actually achive the grand aim of fixing procurement, however we did achieve the majority of our research aims as scoped for the first phase. 

We achieved an empirical review of 'good' procurement from the reports and literature, we mapped out the landscape and factors of influence on Procurement within the BBC, we plotted and assessed the impact of previous intervention within the system and devised tools to measure procurement effectiveness and how the experience lined up with company strategy. 

Bringing together this learning, we recognized that a toolkit or report would not have the influence on the area that we liked and instead we formed 'the ministry of good procurement' which brought together our learning into a manifesto of good procurement and seeks to champion 'good procurement' using more guerilla tactics.
Throughout the project our partners, both academic and comoany were meeting with people creating policy and procurement guidelines. We fed some findings to them directly as we went, but largey the experience and relationship with them led to us considering alternative approaches to disseminate our findings as they said they were overrun with reports and toolkits.

The project and our approach was influential on developing networks between CX and Helsinki, supported by PROUD, Emma Murphy ran a Masterclass featuring the Alpha approach to mapping the Factors of Influence, our findings and recommendations on empathy and our Manifesto with Jussi in Helsiki. 

The Ministry for Good procurement and its associated brand collateral has great potential for impact but requires a full website building and a system so that users can sign up to the manifesto for good procurement and also input their thoughts. We are discussing bringing both the ministry and the Helsinki model of procurement to fieldtrial or a second stage project with FutureGov. That would secure significant impact on the highly complex landscape of procurement.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>546c717e2301a5.27397380-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>University of Dundee:

It has enabled the opportunity to work anywhere, anytime. Yet digital space simultaneously lacks geographic substance; it is both nowhere and everywhere. This project responded to a growing need for design solutions that reduce psychological distance to foster a sense of connectedness in distributed working. It explored how digital visualisations of workspaces can create a sense of being local in digital space and enrich human experience independent of geography, and resulted in the development of a new prototype app. CX PhD researcher Ben Dalton contributed research and design expertise, produced a prototypical digital app, organised workshops and public activities, and disseminated the research at events and in publications.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Tyne and Wear Archives and Museums</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Past Paths</gtr:description><gtr:id>808617D5-852E-48A2-B75C-B3A6BA886366</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Past Paths online discovery interface for Tyne and Wear Archives and Museums online collections</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e15a1f7ecf81.86322948-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Tyne and Wear Archives and Museums (TWAM) provided access to their digital archive and curatorial expertise in the development of the Past Paths system.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>This collaboration is an example of a collaboration that was developed in CX whilst funded from elsewhere.

The bid was successful and CX PhD student Andy Garbett suspended his PhD to deliver part 1 of the project - a new interface to TWAM's archive that moved away form traditional models of archive search to deliver a &amp;quot;visitor&amp;quot; experience centred on the metaphor of a digital journey through the collection involving serendipitous encounters with families of objects that would not normally be discovered by traditional search-based interfaces.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Cumbria</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Blockanomics</gtr:description><gtr:id>A65D7A1F-0C7C-4128-9850-562C15163DA8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Blockonomics: UKAuthority press article</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e04855335f08.72213641-2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>DGKCT LTD

Based on a physical interface, the device provides a platform for people to create digital 3D visual objects representing their states of mind in physical environments and using digital social media. The States of Mind device was produced in parallel with the design of the FACT Liverpool 2015 'Group Therapy: mental distress in a digital age' exhibition in which it was initially presented. A drop-in workshop 'Mapping the emotional landscape of Liverpool' was held during the exhibition, at which museum visitors and workshop participants were invited to talk about their individual journeys to the exhibition, using tangible and tactile rapid-prototyped versions of the digital 3D objects to reflect on their personal mental wellbeing.

When people create and interact with personal profiles, upload personal documents to cloud storage, or generate image metadata by taking and sharing digital images, they are participating in shared digital experiences. The nature of these experiences is often fragmented by the speed of interactions, flattened by homogenised interfaces, and concealed by system architecture. Alongside developing the design artefacts the project set out to develop a set of design guidelines to help Tactical Technology Collective raise awareness of such digital processes using tangible instruments.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Great North Run Culture</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Great North Fabrications</gtr:description><gtr:id>7E24270D-8266-4BC8-8F5B-2A519403176C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Great North Run data things</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e1574d59afa9.85598593-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Great North Culture enabled engagement with runners (and their data), and the general public through inclusion in their Great North Greats exhibition.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Great North Fabrications was a collaboration between CX PhD student Bettina Nissen and Great North Run Culture. Bettina developed a series of workshops as part of the Great North Greats exhibition during which runners' Great North Run (GNR) data was turned into physical objects. The personal data from a participating runner's chip was translated into a unique souvenir for them to take home as a memento of their GNR achievement. During this live materializing workshop running data was translated into physical form, engaging the public not only with new technologies but also giving them the opportunity to explore the data captured from their run in tangible ways. The unique objects were generated by an interactive, digital software (developed by Bettina Nissen) using the runner's tracker number and were fabricated live by the attendees during this time using a 3D printer. Shapes could be generated from previous as well as the current year's running data and could be taken home by participants as personlised souvenirs while a selection of generated forms were displayed in the Hall of Great North Greats. This included data objects from elite runners and a combination of objects generated from data of the public selecting different groups, speeds, gender and age to show the diversity of the North East's public as Great North Greats.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Kent</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Paths of Desire</gtr:description><gtr:id>94D78868-797E-455C-B298-DD1F0D65BE16</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Paths of desire prototype app</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e13f311459f6.34813697-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>University of Kent:

FACT provided access to a large public audience, creative consultation, local knowledge and premises to work in Liverpool. FACT also have strong links with local SMEs who were a target audience for this collaborative work. Stefan Kazassoglou, via his micro-SME Kinicho, brought expertise in 
contemporary sound diffusion technologies and access to a state of the art spatialised sound system - an array of 20 loudspeakers and associated software enabling the creation of immersive third order ambisonic spaces. During the project, Stefan constructed a larger version of his sound system (that was used to present work and stimulate new work) and made several impulse response recordings ('acoustic snapshots') of the locations used (also used as materials in the subsequent creative work). Dr. Magnus Williamson (Newcastle University) brought musicological expertise in European liturgical practices and institutional contexts, 1350-1650, and in the interaction between musical forms, books, ensembles and spaces; he also has brought interests in the role of sound in animating public encounters with lost or 'disappeared' spaces. 
Magnus contributed to critical reflections on the value of the collaborative work (both in Liverpool and in 'disappeared heritage spaces') throughout the project, and is developing further work with CX collaborators as a result.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>'Sound Spaces' was a practical and creative exploration of the potential of spatialised (&amp;quot;3-D&amp;quot;) sound through the making of spatialised sound environments that creatively respond to and gain perspectives on how we experience the urban environment. The project unpacked various elements of what the city is, how it might be (re)imagined as 'disappeared' or non-existent spaces and how it could be explored through sonic environments as material (Ingold, 2013). Through public and SME participation, the project also investigated how SMEs might incorporate spatialised sound in their own creative, technical and public engagement activities. The project was focussed on the city of Liverpool beginning with a four-day public making workshop as part of FACT Liverpool's Build Your Own: Tools for Sharing exhibition programme. During this workshop, participants explored the use of spatialised sound by, for example, creating a fictional map of Liverpool based on the sonic affinities of places within the city ('Soundlines' - one part leyline, one part songline). The workshop also explored the use of inexpensive, self-made technology and sophisticated ambisonic systems (Kinicho) for the creation of digitally spatialised sound environments. CX researchers facilitated the four-day workshop and a later week-long exhibition/residency at FACT. In these activities, CX researchers produced creative work in collaboration with partners and members of the public, and individually, bringing expertise in creative practice and practice-led research.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>English Heritage</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Playful Narrative Realms</gtr:description><gtr:id>4BCDDD8F-D28A-4416-95C8-51757C6AB2B4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Publications in review, ongoing collaborations in discussion.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>546e1e4b6e4f32.84667537-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>University of Northumbria:

Entitled Time &amp;amp; Motion, this programme included an exhibition of artefacts and experiments (13 December 2013 - 24 February 2014 presented at FACT Liverpool), a symposium, film festival, talent lab and a publication. The purpose of Time &amp;amp; Motion was to re-examine the relevance of our traditional notions of the eight-hour working day. Amid the new realities of a globalised experience economy and a working environment that is increasingly distributed, virtualised and digital, our definitions of production and consumption, work and recreation are becoming increasingly blurred. RCA CX researchers Professor Jeremy Myerson, Dr Georgina Voss, Ben Dalton, John Fass, Veronica Ranner, Ben Koslowski, Susannah Haslam and Jimmy Tidey contributed research and design expertise and producation and organised events, a symposium and edited a publication.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>NHS England</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Blood Data visualisation (Kendal)</gtr:description><gtr:id>C3E7A6B3-0E93-485A-BB9C-C465E4385E64</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Prototype app, report</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e049d9439b50.85140936-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>This was a collaboration with NHS clinicans at Preston Royal Hospital</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>CX PhD students Jeremy Davenport and Adrian Gradinar worked to develop a prototype to visualise the dialysing patients blood data to increase patient-clinician communication</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>MeYouandUs</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>TILO</gtr:description><gtr:id>B2F1F115-2949-40C7-BEF5-FDC16465793F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Ongoing</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>546c7cb7a17b72.60595340-2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Develop a hybrid display system for Arts and Cultural venues for marketing, currently intended to be called 'TILO' (the 'software'). alongside the software they will create a website supporting the project at tilo.org.uk which will distribute research and comment as well as providing an overview of the software.

The project through the software and platform will explore how digital public space can have an emotional and personalised dialogue with visitors (public and stakeholders). The software will build on an industry standard digital signage system (called Scala) that centrally manages and schedules digital content.

This will be tested with two arts organisations; The Phoenix Leicester, and The Foundation for Art and Technology in Liverpool ('FACT').</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The CX hub's methodology, and collaborative approach offer an existing framework that could be the starting point for the layer of arts research requested by the AHRC for the TILO project. We propose an extension of this model, whereby the existing partners in TILO are considered similar to the partners within a standard cluster project and we propose two of the existing CX postgraduate researchers are allocated to the project alongside an academic, with Professor Rachel Cooper as a research sponsor and mentor and Dr Andrew Quick as the lead academic.

Whereas the standard CX cluster consists of short, intense research projects running for a few months. We propose a longitudinal approach, whereby postgraduate researchers would be allocated for the 12-month lifecycle of the project at 20%. These researchers would be allocated in kind alongside a budgeted academic (Dr Quick). 

The IOCP are primarily researching the psychological and physiological reaction to the direct experience of interacting with TILO and its affect on brand perception and the locus of control. The CX research would be focused more on evaluating the Arts and cultural sector significance of the results and the strategic organizational opportunities. The emphasis would be on locating the research results within other related digital arts projects, disseminating the information within the arts community and looking at the potential and actual artistic and cultural impact. Both research timelines would run in parallel and be integrated and each strand would inform the other.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Guardian Digital Agency</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Community Data Journalism</gtr:description><gtr:id>A3DFF2CA-7129-4439-B793-05E9AE37935C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Everybody Needs Somebody: Physical Social Networks Visualisation; Adaptation and Input: Defining A Living Curriculum; A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Website: Telling About Browsing</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e0513f101456.66135552-2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Priya Prakesh, Design for Social Change/Changify, contributed to testing, trialling, hosting and polling new formats of regen-making and urban story telling with local community, analytics and data reporting, social media engagement and voice-based reports based on probes put in physical locations.

Consequently, attempts to capture and communicate the heritage of crafts practices might miss important aspects of practitioners' skills and experiences. This project explored the design, development and utilisation of technologies to support the capture and presentation of these intangible aspects of craft practice in two ways. Firstly, by developing a sonification system which translates craft gestures into live audio feedback and secondly by making tangible artefacts from and with the practitioner's movement data. CX researchers faciliated a series of practical and discussion workshops with craft practitioners, developed and iteratively refined a sonification system (gesture-capture tools and software), and produced a series of tangible artefacts based on the gesture data captured.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Glasgow School of Art</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Perceptive Media</gtr:description><gtr:id>EEE9AF4E-160D-4E2B-8B8F-5BC3C666BFB6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In progress</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>546c7da7ab5869.43810467-3</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Mudlark:

HCI has been involved in democracy-related research in a number of ways, from usability studies assessing systems in use (e.g. e-voting systems) to ethnographic studies exploring democratic practices and values of local communities. However, the vast amount of work in HCI focuses on exploring citizens' democratic interactions without questioning the participatory and democratic assumptions underlying them.
We invited researchers and practitioners from the fields of maker communities, DIY electronics, design for democracy, socially engaged arts etc. to submit 200-500 words abstract (by email here) describing a context that you have worked in or designed for focusing on the way in which democracy is practiced.

With the merging of the 'real' with the virtual on and off-line, 'play' with the creation of multiple 'selves' is now commonplace. This offers limitless opportunities for impersonation, deception and fakery; useful tools for political counter-strategies, but also the roots for anxieties regarding loss of control over issues of 'real' identity. So what are the implications for the material realities of the body in the mangled and mutable unreal 'real' of the virtual, digital realm?

Featuring presentations from Dr Shehnaz Suterwalla, Noam Toran, Onkar Kular, Ben Dalton and Leslie Kulesh, participants use the term 'authenticity' as a prism through which to explore and challenge questions regarding impersonation, politics and gendered resistance, addressing the question of whether the faked, forged, inauthentic multitude-identities afforded by the digital era are a cause for panic, or a point of potential?</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dcbc07eb1e89.75522820</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.ica.org.uk/whats-on/authenticity-real-bodies</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>How to capitalise on findings in the arts and humanities</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CCC4AB4D-1B2C-4BA0-9AAF-8100F715845B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>How to capitalise on findings in the arts and humanities - article in ResearchFortnight</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d05012701e50.44759502</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Transnational Masterclass on Creative Facilitation</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D2818862-D968-444E-992B-C2F141623B64</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This workshop was led by Marc Tassoul, a world renowned expert in creative facilitation.

This then led to the creation of the digital game i-dentity in collaboration with RMIT University, Melbourne, Australia.

The abstract follows:

Games are a type of play, but there is also an experience of play within games. This play is the experimental aspect of the game. It allows a person to be expressive and creative which makes these new experiences significant and meaningful [4]. It is why future games and new pervasive sensors will focus on play. These new interfaces will support play through an understanding of spoken language and the ability to determine the body position precisely without latency. They will recognise expressiveness, identify the player's mood and even read lips. This behavioural information will ensure the play in games is natural, spontaneous and appropriate.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dd60a14d1257.96477258</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Publicness in digital public space (interview)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F755774C-32C9-417F-A600-1F2D7B70C51A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Interview about publicness in digital public spaces.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d86cd2757e51.29395312</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/liv-sj%C3%A6l/2014-06-27/der-er-en-ny-eftert%C3%A6nksomhed-p%C3%A5-internettet</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Mixed Reality Game Design</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6FA70F07-2747-4E0A-BA1F-C9454BB3DA5A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Game design workshop at the Mixed Reality Lab, Nottingham.

RITA's main premise is to provide an opportunity for older people across the North East of England to help shape the University's research agenda by suggesting research projects ideas and by highlighting questions that are pivotal to the experiences and lives of older people. The competition is also intended as a way to support research engagement by members of regional U3A's - both by learning about latest research or undertaking research themselves - and as such emphasising the original values of cooperative and lifelong learning that the U3A organisation was initially founded upon.
Since March 2013 we have been running design workshops with U3A 'research ambassadors' who act as advocates for research within their own U3As. In these workshops we have been both support them developing research ideas and to explore what it means for there to be a 'research culture' within the U3A. We have been doing this through a combination of methods that allow them to share personal stories related to research, to deliberate in groups on what makes meaningful research activity, to reflect on the challenges they have faced within their own local U3As as advocates of research, and to provide informal feedback and critique to other peoples project ideas. The project so far has revealed a great many challenges related to preconceptions of the value of different approaches to research and how to support a diverse set of individuals with different levels of commitment and interest to research in engaging in their own research activities. At the same time, it is providing interesting insight into alternative notions of undertaking citizen science, which is often limited to treating the public as a node to collect information for scientific pursuits.
Our work on the project is open-ended but is likely to continue through to the development of digital tools and resources for U3A members and Research Ambassadors to co-ordinate their research activities with each other.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dc7fa15d7321.19953935</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Quantified Self - CIID Summer School workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2FBAABC5-CB53-4293-A7C5-1E6A3C2AB4DF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Participation in a workshop facilitated by Marius Watz &amp;amp; Antoni Kaniowski learning initial skills programming with data.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56db7e22113392.67793183</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://ciid.dk/education/summer-school/ciid-summer-school-2013/quantified-self/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Data-driven generative design of personalised mementos (workshop contribution at CHI'13)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AA4C4127-E27D-4C17-A9B4-797BFC04092F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Position paper and presentation as part of a workshop (FAB at CHI) at the conference CHI 2013 to stimulate debate amongst attending researchers</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56db7537948784.99371342</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://fabworkshop.media.mit.edu/2013/04/21/data-driven-generative-design-of-personalized-mementos/#more-106</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Ageing Playfully: Our favourite things Workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CCA1E688-D9E2-4388-93B1-B646787B7338</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In our first in a series of workshops the team used playful and creative ways to explore the range and type of activities enjoyed by all.

In this workshop week we asked students to rethink and explore the full potential of biological materials and transience and what way and manifestations this contrasts existing fossil-fuel derived ones.

&amp;quot;At present, the origins of materials and resources used in our designed electronics and objects are unclear and difficult to trace back. This is mostly the case for fossil-fuel derived and raw materials, such as plastics and precious metals, which require long, complex supply chains all over the globe with multiple geographical sources.
These materials are problematic as such, as they cannot be returned into the ecological material cycle, but lead to hazardous landfills and pacific garbage patches instead. We would like you to develop an understanding how transient materials differ from our current material culture.
What does it mean to design temporary things that are programmable, melt, and disappear on demand and how would they look and feel like? The goal of this seminar week is to design an object that represents your take on transient materials.&amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56ddb458416177.12847697</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.zhdk.ch/index.php?id=93808</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Cinehack @ Leeds International Film Festival</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8E4A1C7B-4B6B-4235-8A08-CBEB7DB59128</gtr:id><gtr:impact>An invited workshop at Leeds International Film Festival, during which we used a number of 'cinehacks' to help generate cinematic documentary footage of the festival with approximately 30 volunteers.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dd4f0d305509.90890570</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.leedsfilm.com/films/cinehacking-liff/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Exhibition of Biophilia - Organ Crafting NEXT NATURE - Nano Supermarket</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BAFC8A31-DA25-412F-8FE7-89406E91FDE3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>&amp;quot;Biophilia - Organ Crafting&amp;quot; has been on long-term loan for four years with dutch art organisation NEXT NATURE and has now been extended the loan for another year.

I formed a team with one undergrad and a lecturer in games to create an Imaginary Skip Rope game.

This game was interesting because unlike traditional Skip Rope our game is a little more forgiving - there is a relatively low risk of injury since you can jump to any height, we could introduce dynamic balancing to give new players an advantage, you could play it remotely over the Internet, there's no right and wrong answer (you're not out when you get hit), and best of all, you use your imagination.

We simulate the rope using verlet integration - so the game is authentically reproducing a rope behind the scenes. Players can collide with the rope when it is at the low point in the travel, unless of course they jump.

We integrate to find the position of the blue/red controllers which we use to spin the rope. To detect when the central players have jumped we measure the magnitude of the movement of the white controllers.

Players are given a &amp;quot;rolling start&amp;quot; by letting the end players &amp;quot;arm&amp;quot; the PlayStation Move controllers once players are ready. Each game lasts only twenty seconds - the best player is indicated by giving them a green light, the other, a red light.

What Do We Do Now? was the theme to GGJ15. As players on both sides of the rope - we become a little bit of the game engine - what do we do now? Do we play nice or do we go fast?

At the end of the Game Jam this was presented to the students on Lincoln's games programming course and I was able to release the code for them to see how it was created.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dc7e99966706.62335212</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://thecreativeexchange.org/activity/imaginary-skip-rope</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Daemons and Sock-Puppets: Metaphors of Personal Identity for Pseudonymity in Digital Public Spaces (Artefact talk series) - Ben Dalton</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8D41DA89-CAA5-4CA2-9121-070E4B0C1BD6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A talk in the Artifact Project series to a mixed audience of scientists and artists, students of Imperial College and Royal College of Art along with members of the public.

&amp;quot;This research examines the role of pseudonymity in design practice for digital communication and everyday life. A reoccurring challenge in exploring the potential of digital public space is the creation and control of personal identities. The requirement for people to use a single, 'real-name' identity has emerged as a key concern of social networks, internet commerce and government services online. This is problematic, since identity is often described and understood in terms of multiple facets, performances, characters and masks rather than just a single, 'real' name. Furthermore, there are persuasive pre-digital cases for the value and necessity of pseudonyms in communication and society, including political critique, nom de plume, puppetry, witness protection and identity exploration.&amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dddfaec5fd59.05831577</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.union.ic.ac.uk/arts/artifact/about-us/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>TRADERS Big Data in the City: exploring notions of design and agency</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2D5C588A-E941-4AB4-A2BD-D61AC4A26765</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Group workshop led for TRADERS training week 4: data mining.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d9884dab2867.26204168</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Lincoln Games Group</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4BF49989-EB14-414C-AA53-CAB2125A0DCE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>January 12th 2015 - Presentation to Lincoln Universities - Game Research Group

This was a 20 minute presentation of the i-dentity game to the Lincoln Games Group.

This was given to about 20 students and staff from the group. The framing of the presentation described i-dentity as a game drawn from the tradition of childhood games and play that makes us challenge the way we think about games. 

i-dentity is a body-space game that is played with a tangible interface. i-dentity was designed in the Game Jam at CHI 2013 and inspired by traditional play. The game was motivated by advocates of the New Games Movement, such as Bernard De Koven who suggests that designers should reconsider old playground games and how we play together.

i-dentity used childhood games such as Sleeping Lions and What Time is it Mr. Wolf as a starting point for design. Through role-play and experimentation with digital prototypes we explore how the core elements of these games can be represented digitally and these changed during development of the game. Our paper describes how this crossover from physical play to a digital game created new compelling and social gameplay.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dcaac112b556.81371375</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Undergraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Magic Worlds</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7F10EBAE-DF72-447D-98A9-951E2D83BFAD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>An interactive cauldron designed for a traveling children exhibition which creates light and sound feedback when ingredients are placed within it.

Each participant chose some type of personal activity to monitor and analyze, learning something about the obsessiveness of the data-driven world view in the process. Once collected, we looked at how data can be visualized. Processing will be our primary tool for visualization, allowing us to exploit the power of computation to do statistical analysis and help us generate custom visuals by mapping properties found in the data set to suitable visual structures that simultaneously clarify and illuminate the ideas we wish to communicate.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dc7ba1cfe2f1.37189245</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://ciid.dk/education/summer-school/ciid-summer-school-2013/quantified-self/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talk on research on cycling, within the broader context of changing research and policy challenges (2014)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>683C6EDA-2405-4858-B6AE-84AF73A87ABC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Talk organised by the Policy Studies Institute where I spoke about my research

Gavin Wood attended this workshop through the submission of a workshop paper with the expectation to look at games that supported more physical and social play - inspired by the ideas of childhood play and games.

The workshop was led by RMIT and we formed a team with the following people to create a new design:
 Jayden Garner RMIT University, Melbourne, Australia
Gavin Wood Newcastle University, Newcastle Upon Tyne, United Kingdom
Sebastiaan Pijnappel RMIT University, Melbourne, Australia
Martin Murer University of Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria
Florian Mueller RMIT University, Melbourne, Australia

The result of this workshop was the creation of the game i-dentity and its related full paper at CHI 2014:

This then led to plans for extending the game Intangle to a tool for playworkers and youth workers - Talk About Sex.

The abstract for this workshop submission follows:

We are interested in embarrassing interactions as part of wider research that is exploring how play-centric game design allows us to create new engaging play experiences between players and their environment. Embarrassing interactions are an important feature of play and an inevitable facet of games that can be played in the real world. In this abstract we discuss several innovative designs where digital play has given us the opportunity to explore, manage and leverage embarrassment. We describe our method for creating more &amp;quot;playful&amp;quot; games and discuss the type of interactions we expect to experience and capture. We then describe our Wild Man mobile phone game where we find our digital game provides a convenient alibi for unconventional play in a heritage space.

In the actual workshop we explored how designers can leverage embarrassing in order to encourage young people to explore important issues.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dd61ee0243d4.08539019</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Interglacial Performing Collections</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D18BFBEC-A569-4FA9-8059-3CCD5802E8D6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>3 day artistic residency responding to various artifacts from Ipswich Musuems, culminated in a public sound installation.

The Polyphonic Futures platform has been launched via a multi-media installation at the Raphael Gallery at the Victoria &amp;amp; Albert Museum (V&amp;amp;A) in London on the 24rd- 25th Sep 2016.
The platform has been launched online, a video has been screened in the gallery, and new members for the platform were aquired through 8 workshop sessions, based on drop-in sign-ups. Firstly, the new members were introduced to the bio-digital enabling material silk in a brief hands-on session, secondly, they contributed their own version of a biomaterial future via a paper sheet, that was then photographed and uploaded via Ipads to the platforms' data base. During these days 45 new members were gained for the platform, excellent feedback was given for the design and structure of the platform. During this busy publicly accessible event, people have expressed throughout an explicit wish to be further involved in public-facing science-design intiatives like Polyphonic Futures, which helped solidifying the research hypothesis with this project.

Many of the participants didn't know each other.

The parish council explained to the group that it was running a survey of local residents. Bretton has a large Polish community, and the parish council could not afford to translate the survey into Polish, which limited the effectiveness of the survey.

Teachers from the school said they could encourage bilingual polish-speaking students doing their Duke of Edinburgh award to help administer the survey more widely, as a result 50 extra surveys were completed.

Meeting community needs (survey translation) using an existing community resource (the DoE students) is an example of the value of creating new community connections.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56df081831f8f7.53265047</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://localnets.org</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Zines in the age of 'big data'? at Artists, Scientists and Makers evening Superposition V - Ben Dalton</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>71EED3B5-A530-4D1E-81AA-71BB252B470A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation on the Bundle Publishing CX project at an event for artists, scientists and makers organised by the Superposition group in West Yorkshire.

Professional magician and slight-of-hand artist, Tony O'Neill, experimental jazz musician and neuroscientist Christophe de B&amp;eacute;zenac and digital artist Ben Dalton will talk.

Ben Dalton's talk 'Zines in the age of 'big data'?' introduces and proposes the idea of bundle publishing. At odds with current trends in digital distribution, bundle publishing involves editing a large collection of digital content and then publishing it on a specific date as a single, large ?le. Inspired, in part, by the Humble Indie Bundle initiative as a means of pay what you want, charity supporting, DRM Free, cross-platform game distribution. Dalton asks what forms these user funded digital publications may take and what issues there may be surrounding distribution. This talk aims to raise questions about design, the future of live broadcast, crowd access to 'big data' and the role of spectacle in digital public space as a means of creating masquerade.&amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e08ea9cd4bf8.83810219</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.thesuperposition.org/005magicperception/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Thinking Digital Tweet Translations - Bettina Nissen</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BE35F6AF-7F1C-4D36-868F-4368970DBB9C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This deployment of a newly developed data making activity engaged this digital conference's community in offline conversation about their twitter and social media habits.

1) at the design of game for young people in a library
2) deployed the game with a school

To begin exploring the potential of linking play and storytelling together in a library-based game, we held an initial exploratory workshop at Benjamin Road. The participants were the project team, which included two computer scientists, two games designers, an interaction designer, two creative writers, an English teacher, a children's book author and a member of library staff. The primary aim of the workshop was to develop a common understanding across the team about the potential for using games to engage children in reading and writing about
books. The majority of the workshop was spent with the team working in three small groups and 'experience prototyping' basic games that were acted out in the library. Each group used blank playing cards to make basic prompts that initiated playful interactions with the library's book collection. After prototyping and iterating their games, the groups reconvened to share ideas and created the design for a digital game prototype.

Following this exploratory workshop, we made prompts into an initial card-based playful storytelling game. This was piloted with groups of children aged 8 to 10 years on a school visit to Benjamin Road Library.

The digital version of DoHS was then written and deployed in Benjamin Road Library in two further workshops with the same 20 children who had participated in the pilot study. As before, the children were accompanied by teaching staff. We used the dictation facility on each mobile phone as a way of documenting audio from the workshop, which enabled us to capture the children's conversations both in the workshop room and in the library space itself. This was supplemented by field notes from each researcher detailing interactions between children, teachers and facilitators as well as the children's use of the library space. DoHS also logged interactions with books for later analysis.

Over the course of the two 2-hour workshops, the twenty children collected 109 books. The books chosen by them to incorporate into their stories were diverse, ranging from non-fiction such as books on the geography of Asia, to fiction such as Alice in Wonderland and Dracula. The relative freedom that we provided for the children to explore the library also meant that there were instances where children picked books from the adult section, much to the bemusement and occasional concern of the teachers. 10 of the 109 books in total were used by both of the workshop.

The following paper contains more detail about these workshops:

The project used narrative to (re)interpret and (re)present digital information across digital and physical space. By exploring modes of interaction and co-production, this project aimed to connect bits of digital interaction with embodied experience and to develop innovative and playful ways to experience geographic data.

The project asked a series of questions: How can a Twitter-based fictional narrative reconstruct the experience of dwelling in the city? Which kind of textual, visual and tangible formats support the reading of data through narrative? And how might these shape or shift the experience of the city and of the digital streams of information that surround us, as they add to both?</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dc7870401be0.76239461</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>CX Conference.

As we become more connected, information and collaborations (enabled by new technology and business practice) further promote this fruitful exchange. This conference aimed to explore and propagate new mutually beneficial exchanges between academia and the creative industries.
Specifically we focussed on:
Academics developing new understandings of the creative sector
New and innovative forms of academic collaboration with creative sector partners
New processes, tools or approaches that facilitate knowledge exchange and collaboration
Members of the creative commercial sector who are interested in moving into academia and starting to undertake research.
This was not a traditional 'sit and listen' conference. There was a high degree of both experimentation in the form of the conference and interaction throughout the conference.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dc7e2477c1a8.02937243</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://thecreativeexchange.org/tkex</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Red Squirrel Workshops (Cumbria &amp; Northumberland)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3081BC7A-87EF-48B5-A250-9A8DF3112002</gtr:id><gtr:impact>20 people attended 2 half day workshops about red squirrel conservation and storytelling, which led to the development of an interactive documentary about the subject.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dc1fa870bea8.15921795</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Wild Man Game presented in Korea</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C2BFC0DF-1395-4585-A1D6-C74C2520DBF2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Wild Man Game has just been presented at a Serious Games' symposium and at the British Embassy in Seoul, Korea.

The Wild Man Game formed my part of two talks on Serious Games in Seoul, Korea.

The talks were part of a special invitation from Prof. William Latham | Goldsmiths and Dr. Brigitta Zics | Ravensbourne who have received British Embassy support to set up a knowledge exchange network in Serious Games &amp;amp; Gamification and facilitate a Symposium between Korea and UK researchers, industry experts and academics.

The visit spanned a week with an initial networking event between Seoul National University, Korea University, UCL and Goldsmiths that looked to create a common ground for future exchanges between UK- Korea and generate a platform for collaborative projects.

Our colleagues hope that this event will be a starting point for long-standing exchanges between UK and Korea delegates with research interest on games, serious games and gamification.

The presenters view on games challenged the audience on gamification using the Wild Man as an example. For example, in relating this to psychology, he discussed how play can drive change around meaning and attitudes, while gaming can often be link with excelling against a ruleset.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dd4fa0567c91.65541766</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://thecreativeexchange.org/activity/wild-man-game-bridges-digital-seoul</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Private Clouds Public Good</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>123F02B0-D5CB-481E-8488-A2318225D3F1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Hosted as part of AcrossRCA.

Many of the devices developed were used to generate or listen to sound for communication purposes. From radio broadcasts to early underwater microphones, listening was a key strategy in the war effort. Many accounts of the war recollect sound as the primary sensory experience yet no sound recordings actually exist. There is an interesting space for creatively imagining what these technologies actually sounded like. In this project we aim to rebuild some of these once innovative technologies, many of which are still being used and developed today. Through engaging with how these devices were made we hope to bring a creative and contemporary perspective to this time of technological progress.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56db2aff4bc587.29048108</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://transmit-receive.tumblr.com</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Several invited talks at Cycle City Active City 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>41917BC6-8F43-4031-8DD6-BB7A6EC138D6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Several talks at Cycle City Active City, including:

The goal of the workshop is to reflect on how HCI research can contribute to democracy, taking into consideration the heavily subjective nature of both &amp;quot;democracy&amp;quot; as a value and &amp;quot;participation&amp;quot; as a means to achieve it.

HCI has been involved in democracy-related research in a number of ways, from usability studies assessing systems in use (e.g. e-voting systems) to ethnographic studies exploring democratic practices and values of local communities. However, the vast amount of work in HCI focuses on exploring citizens' democratic interactions without questioning the participatory and democratic assumptions underlying them.

We hosted 30 researchers within this area for a 1 day workshop to explore this topic.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dad0ca20fc31.87757642</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://hci-democracy.co.uk/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Conference</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6C1C746E-D416-4F8A-A741-87354EC646D4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Filming of CX PhD students and exhibition material for the end of CX at FACT in Liverpool</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6c33e861861.68834023</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Art Hackathon</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CE2E42BD-DABB-4301-8173-BC3757EBDA5D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>http://arthackathon.co.uk/</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56df05c6d61bd4.30174023</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://arthackathon.co.uk/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Great North Fabrications</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A66AD23C-E920-49AA-9AF5-D9DA2373185C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>200-300 people attended this series of 3D printing workshops engaging them with running data and new technologies to encourage reflection, discussion and learning, in collaboration with Great North Run Culture and Tyne and Wear Archives and Museums</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56db5e838accd9.92319746</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://makingdatathings.wordpress.com/2015/08/18/great-north-fabrications/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seminar: Textiles as an Interface</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>94D66C2D-3BAB-4FE1-A1C1-08585A6476B3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Led by Veronica Ranner, PhD candidate, The Creative Exchange and Dr Dan Lockton, Visiting Research Tutor, IDE, this seminar explores the role Textiles can play as an interface - from the traditional example being the interface between our selves and our environments through the clothes that we wear, to advanced materials and their shifting implications for society.

Alongside with wearable tech, body interface that quantify everything, notions of control, omnipresence, surveillance, and inescapability are not afar. While makers of these technologies
are focusing on feasibility, manufacturing, biomaterial performance, and ease of use (see 'invisible design'), artists and designers are challenged with the question how to operate and practice in a technological climate increasingly dominated by control.

Attendees from across the UK, both partners and participants in CX, and attendees invited to see, use and discuss the outcomes and findings of the hub.

Premiering at FACT (Foundation for Art and Creative Technology), The Creative Exchange presents the new exhibition Designing Digital Now, taking a critical look at how we are shaping digital technologies and, in turn, how digital technologies are shaping us. The exhibition is showcased in the FACT Connects space between 17 - 25 June, exploring how digital resources from smartphones to Facebook have transformed what each of us can learn, make and do. Visitors are invited to explore how designers, makers and artists have worked across public and private sectors to develop new concepts, products, services and infrastructures. Responding to today's complex picture of technological risk and opportunity, the exhibition will present collaborations that cross between education, industry and government, revealing emergent intersections between digital technologies and our everyday lives. Designing Digital Now looks into how digital things can be imagined, designed and made in ways guided by our creative and ethical needs, rather than the functional capabilities of digital technology. The exhibition features prototype products, infographics and films alongside a number of interactive exhibits from smartphone apps to a giant collaborative drawing machine. A programme of events will accompany the exhibition, ranging from workshops on digital games or self-publishing magazines. Visitors are invited to contribute their own stories to a digital map of Liverpool, become part of a participatory documentary or experience a live audio walk around the city. The exhibition is part of a special programme of pop-up exhibitions which is showcased this spring and summer in the FACT Connects space, in the foyer at FACT (Foundation for Art and Creative Technology). FACT Connects is a wide-ranging programme, which engages with members of the community, and allows FACT to connect even more with artists, musicians, and makers.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c8134c659ca8.08033293</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://thecreativeexchange.org/activity/designing-digital-now-exhibition-17-25th-june-fact-liverpool</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>BBC North industry placement for 5 months</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C6AB2C39-220F-41F3-B923-CB78CD35D292</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Andrew Garbett was hosted at BBC North Research and Development lab for 5 months in order to interview professional journalists and their practices of incorporating citizen journalism within the national news agenda.

Our aim was to bring people together to share ideas, experiences and concepts as well as build digital prototypes that break-down, problematize and otherwise explore the digital design space around dementia and dementia care. We wanted to motivate critical, even subversive, provocative designs that might attempt to raise questions rather than provide technical solutions.

We made our invitation open to a wide range of people, including: software and hardware developers, designers and practitioners with backgrounds in, for instance, Human-Computer Interaction, interaction design, healthcare or education, or anyone who was interested in identifying new ideas, critiques and digital designs for the care of people with dementia. Teams competed for juried prizes and we provided space for work, rest and creativity as well as food, inspiring speakers, mentors and prototyping hardware and facilities.&amp;quot;

We formed our team with Dave Green, Newcastle University and Kellie Morrissey, UCC, and created Swaythe Band. This digital prototype received the prize for Best Project at the event.

The prototype has now been used for Kellie's fieldwork at UCC and we are awaiting news on a DIS2016 submission.

The game was created in collaboration with staff from the heritage site and a specialist in eighteenth-century culture from the Newcastle University.

In a series of workshops with a senior curator at English Heritage we rediscovered the motif of a Wild Man that is &amp;quot;resident&amp;quot; at this site. This motif was then used to inspire the design of a game that supports social, physical play which visitors can enjoy together. Observation of families using our digital prototype revealed how our game intertwined play with the affordances of the space - such as those of its hidden stories, histories and meaning. Based on our work we suggest that playful digital games create new relationships with our heritage spaces and remove the preconceptions young people have that these places are &amp;quot;stuffy&amp;quot; boring destinations.

The workshops led to the creation of a digital game which we deployed in an evaluation with four families from the general public which allowed us to further refine the game.

Finally, the game was played on a special &amp;quot;events day&amp;quot; around the Wild Man which was also promoted by English Heritage. As part of this open day a group of young people visited the site with the Community Interest Company - Bad Apples North East - as part of their Key Fund activities.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dd5cc1e1a981.38224273</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Perceptive Media: Poster Session Interact 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>12E06D9E-5657-480B-BBD2-B3CE2278BCC7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A poster session discussing with people and demonstrating to them the use of Perceptive Media and how it could change performances.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d97a159b20f6.80673816</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>PANEL: Design for Dialogue</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>76ED66C5-E75A-4295-88DF-ECC9200A5B5D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I have been invited as panellist (&amp;quot;catalyst&amp;quot;) as part of a conversation called &amp;quot;Design for Dialogue&amp;quot;, organised by Culture Lab (Newcastle) at the Design Research Conference (DRS 2014), Ume&amp;aring; Institute of Design, Sweden.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e05b38d2d4c6.27615313</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://openlab.ncl.ac.uk/drs2014/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Hack Lancaster - 24h Heritage Hackathon in Lancaster</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4874ADAC-EE1E-4129-8166-2B86FA5B90D3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A Hackathon, support by CX, bringing together coders, scientists, designers, historians and innovators to create digital things using newly release local archaeological data.

The process investigate alternative modes of political participation in discussions about city planning and place making. The process situates political engagement and discussion about the city, in the city itself through the use location based media content access and creation. The process comprises of two parts. In the first part of the process a group of people are invited to do a walk in the city and generate stops, by associating personal design prompts to specific locations along the walk and justify their choice, which are digitally recorded. The group can then access archival material relating to political controversies and mechanism of city planning. At the end of these walks each group generates routes, stops and user generated media content, which is then utilised to construct a walking trail. Other city residents can then do this walking tour to invite other city residents to discover locations and related issues and add their own opinions. 
In this way the City Walk process aims at constituting an ongoing process of user generated content in ad about the city towards the re-envisioning of specific location in the city. 

City Walks was utilised as a process and method in the My Place project with members if the Elders Council to explore how they could have an impact on city planning in the age friendly city. City Walks was significant in supporting the group formulating ideas and demands for changes in the city as well as enter in constructive dialogue with the local planners and authorities.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dc7893a615e6.66034364</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013,2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>RCUK TSB AHRC Workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AF17AE22-C2B2-4B60-A060-F745C61B9283</gtr:id><gtr:impact>N/A</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54620c5f9b0542.04698366</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academic audiences (collaborators, peers etc.)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Digitally Fabricating Data-Things: A Participatory Approach to Making Data Physical (workshop contribution - CHI'15)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1D8428CC-5687-4483-B315-66459DEC7EAF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A position paper presented in a workshop (Making Data Physical) at CHI 2015 encouraging debate amongst participating researchers</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56db74664cabb3.41708969</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://makingdatathings.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/nissen-participatorydatathings-final.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>3rd Living Assemblies Workshop - Design Your Silken Self</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>36797C36-5F22-41CB-903F-6B1B5A602CF8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>International guest speakers:

During this two-day workshop, organised in collaboration with The Arts Catalyst as part of the CX Polyphonic Futures project, participants collaboratively explored the potential of reverse engineered silk, currently confined to laboratories. Taking the body as the first site for investigation, Veronica Ranner asked participants to consider themselves as &amp;quot;Living Assembly&amp;quot; that can be hacked, enhanced and patched into through using bio-digital materials. Activities involved material experiments combined with a narrative design process to speculate on silk's possible future use in the world.

This then led to the creation of the digital game Intangle in collaboration with RMIT University, Melbourne, Australia.

The abstract follows:

Traditional play and its games offer a unique opportunity for game design research since its games are almost always engaging, creative and fun. They are typical of the well-played games described by Bernard DeKoven. As we look to capture the values of this play in computer games we need new approaches to game design. Game Jams provide a suitable approach; Games Jams are playful, they encourage exploration of rules and boundaries, and through seeking innovation they avoid the mainstays of computer game development.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dd61139b2925.95390180</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Lecture: Inflating Curiosity event; Polyphonic Futures - Design, Silk, and Bio-Digital Interfaces</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F9BC6A20-675D-439A-B74E-EDBFF854A159</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I have been invited the MIT Media Lab, Tangible Media Group (led by Prof. Hiroshi Ishii) to give a lecture as part of the &amp;quot;Inflating Curiosity&amp;quot; event at the Royal College of Art, UK.

&amp;quot;This talk presents co-performance as a potential tool for anonymous pseudonymity. We can define anonymised pseudonyms as identities for communication, untraceably disassociated from a performer, that are persistent in use long enough to establish some measure of social reputation. Digitally authoring or controlling an identity allows for provenance to be hidden through cryptographic systems. However, mass storage and processing can uncover 'signatures' and 'fingerprints' in diverse communication modes. These include approaches as varied as writing style, time-of-day analysis, and camera or other hardware profiling.

Anonymous pseudonyms enable creative experimentation and are a healthy extension of multifaceted identity. Historical norms in writing, performance and innovation demonstrate the broad-reaching benefit of creativity under the security of invented names and characters. On the web, particularly in the early years of the internet, easy forms of anonymous reputation management have proven invaluable for numerous contexts of social interaction and debate. Untraceable pseudonyms also make open critique and whistleblowing possible.

Co-performed identities, in which multiple people control a single character, offer an opportunity for increasing the complexity of attempts at 'fingerprinting'. Examples are presented to illustrate this design space, including historical cases such as Nicolas Bourbaki, expert co-performers such as commercial puppeteers, and trends in internet use in which prototype co-performed identities seem to have spontaneously emerged.&amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dde196bac362.66627797</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://vimeo.com/119157252</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Perceptive Media Workshop MozFest</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B596DCFD-2257-4F32-844E-4600E69C2432</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A workshop and Science Fair at Mozfest 2015</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d9791eef4c94.86642253</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The Wild Man Game - bringing historic places to life</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6FB2754B-6D88-4261-98AF-6C7CCA51FF5F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>http://www.software.ac.uk blog is widely read blog (more than 10,000 unique views per week) which details software projects.

The theme of this seminar was the translation of ideas into actual benefits for older people - for health, education, sociability, and fun. My presentation looked at the benefits of designing digital technologies for experiences of play.

There were domain experts such as RNIB, Help the Aged, academics and some members of the public.

My talk was 20 minutes - and presented how we can use playful design as a way to challenge current design practices and open up</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dc3af0489a44.04608784</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talk on Near Miss Project to POMPEYBUG (Portsmouth Cycle Forum), November 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>72211DD9-1CDA-4A86-B334-E3B694C431DF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I was the guest speaker at a well attended meeting of POMPEYBUG; representatives from the local authority were in attendance as well as members of the public.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d84c447dd632.07934506</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>GamesJam - CHI 2014 Games Competition</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D95568E0-CE62-430B-9445-10A25DA506DA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This output formed part of The Creative Exchange, a broad programme of activities with notable impact in multiple areas.

They were carried out through a collaboration with Bad Apples - a community interest company (CIC) in the North East who work with young people.

They took place during Keyfund workshops which are being run at the Bad Apples studios. These workshops are part of a scheme encourages people to find new skills by funding activities where young people manage, lead and take ownership of projects.

Bad Apples are currently using creative-play in these workshops and we looked at augmenting this part of the session with digital play and games. We will explored how this play can encourage the young people to be creative, foster communication across these groups, and help support attachment with the space.

As part of this research we will aim to give young people who do not get a chance to make games an opportunity to participate in the design of digital games and play. We hope that these games can then be used as a tool by other organisations that reach out to new young people.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dc3f4077f421.58177287</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Living Assemblies Roundtable Session</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>805E2C6F-8218-41E7-AA74-C25FE308F0C6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Roundtable session with the scientists from SilkLab as part of the Polyphonic Futures project.

Through this activity, we also developed
capacity and capability in creative businesses and developed public service innovation. The demonstrable impact of the CX Hub can be described under three headings - economic impact, social impact and cultural impact.
This project resulted in over 100 new concepts for products and services, these are being adopted to varying degrees by the partner organisations. 
The 42 academics involved in the work are also using the KE Techniques in their working practices and developing further KE with similar or the same partnering organisations.

Through novel partnerships of academic, industry, public and third sector expertise, and creative applications of digital media and technology in social and cultural contexts, the CX Hub explored new ground in terms of method and approach. It catalysed a series of paradigm shifts in the sector and delivered value through its outputs.
Four Paradigm Shifts
? A shift to a more integrated, cohesive and effective approach to working with small and micro creative and digital business, which have not traditionally engaged with academic research
? A shift from the concept of Digital Public Space as an online cultural archive, as initially proposed by the BBC, to a series of interactive digital public spaces with broader scope for business innovation
? A shift beyond traditional models of PhD research to a more flexible and
dynamic approach better suited to working with creative and cultural SMEs in the sector
? A shift from Knowledge Exchange to Creative Exchange, focusing on the
distinctive quality and value of cross-sector collaboration in the Arts &amp;amp;
Humanities.
Value
The CX Hub:
? Invested &amp;pound;333,237 in 94 projects (core and associated), generating significant value for a network of 176 contributors from 107 connected organisations as well as attracting leveraged funding of more than &amp;pound;1.8 million
? Generated more than 100 concepts and prototypes for new products and
services, creating new IP and 45 new jobs in creative and digital SMEs and in academia
? Produced 21 highly skilled people at Doctoral level who can lead new 'hybrid' thinking both in academia and industry in the creative economy
? Engaged with 150 academics across the Arts &amp;amp; Humanities and other fields and signed up 42 academics to collaboration agreements, developing new models of collaboration that have subsequently been adopted outside the CX Hub
? Secured further research funding of more than &amp;pound;17.5 million by CX partners to address related topics in the creative and digital sector.

The major achievements of the CX Hub can be summarised under four headings: New Thinking on Innovation in Digital Public Space (industry-theory sphere); New Product, Service and Technology Development (industry-practice sphere); New PhD Models and Capacity (academia-theory sphere); and New Forms of KE (academia-practice sphere).
 
The CX focused from the start on the innovation potential of Digital Public Space (DPS), initially working with core partner the BBC at MediaCityUK in Salford and its creative hinterland in the northwest to explore the Corporation's vision of open access online national cultural archives. An achievement of the CX project as a whole has been to radically broaden the concept of DPS to embrace the value creation opportunities in a range of additional digital public spaces resulting from social, civic, health and co-working flows of data. Through papers, events and think tanks, the CX started a profound debate about the future of DPS in the UK, built an autonomous expert forum comprising representatives from such bodies as the BBC, British Library, Wellcome Trust, Wikipedia and Ofcom, and is set to catalyse a Charter for Digital Public Space. This will define and seek to protect the public interest in DPS and will be of huge benefit to the many small creative firms seeking to innovate in this area.
 
New Products and Services
A key achievement of the CX Hub has been to develop new products, services and technologies designed to create new opportunities for creative businesses while bringing benefits to communities in the North of England and beyond. We have evidence of new apps, games and software, alongside spin out company formation
and job creation in micro firms. Four service and product development themes emerged over the life of the Hub:
? Heritage, place and tourism: novel applications of digital technology were used
to re-envision heritage/tourism offers
? Citizen participation: creative digital technologies were adopted to encourage
more open democratic processes in local communities
? Public service redesign: open data and other technology resources were co-opted
to improve local services, from transport to health
? Entrepreneurship: there was particular emphasis on working with hard-to-reach micro-businesses

New PhD Model
A distinctive achievement of the CX Hub lay in the recruitment and supervision of a cohort of 21 PhD students across the three institutions. These PhDs engaged in a series of mini-projects with academics and companies as innovation collaborators
and facilitators. To effectively combine doctoral work with innovation practice and KE required a new mixed-mode PhD model between theoretical enquiry and realworld application to be developed. The result is a new 'hybrid' cohort of researchers in KE who add capacity in the field and will, as they take up new roles, help to re-calibrate approaches across the sector in the future. The PhD cohort also
played a significant role in a deliberate shift of strategy during the project to introduce more informal, iterative and organic models of engagement with the creative economy.

New Forms of Knowledge Exchange
The CX's final major contribution lies in its work on new KE platforms and models, leading to our promotion of the idea that the digitally enabled creative economy requires swift, agile and networked 'Creative Exchange' and not simply a linear 'tech-transfer' model of knowledge exchange which presumes a simple bidirectional
transaction along a single axis of demand-produce-supply. This new
approach was first crystallised in a major two-day KE conference at Lancaster University in September 2013, and subsequently developed in PhD theses,academic papers, further projects and other outputs. In this context, the CX achievement lies in piloting new approaches that demonstrate the different and distinctive qualities that the Arts &amp;amp; Humanities bring to KE, in addition to challenging both academics and supporting university systems to be more responsive and flexible in how they operate. These new forms of KE are now evident in the three partner institutions in the CX Hub.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We anticipate that the take up from the CX Hub's activity with its partners will be broad-based and diffused over time. Here are some specific activities that we know will be taken forward:
 
? Red Ninja is working with a CX intern to develop the Open Planning software application and implement with city councils 2016-17
(contact: Lee Omar, Red Ninja, lomar@redninja.co.uk)
 
? NHS Preston Hospital is working on phase two of the Blood Data Visualisation app through to full trials 2016 -17
(contact: Jeremy Davenport, j.davenport2@lancaster.ac.uk)
 
? Development of SME digital engagement with the Digital Catapult Centre in the North East January 2016 -June 2016
(contact: David Dunn, david.dunn@sunderlandsoftwarecity.com)
The CX programme has led to further research investment and will result in significant and wider impact on industry and society in general:
 
? EPSRC IOT PETRAS grant (announced January 2016) in collaboration with UCL,Imperial, Oxford, Warwick and 40 companies includes our partners in CX, BBCand Microsoft, Cooper and Coulton (a CX collaborating academic) are leading on adoption and acceptability, design and behaviour in relation to privacy, ethics and trust (all research topics covered under the CX programme)
 
? EPSRC Digital Civics (Wright and Olivier). This Centre for Doctoral Training is supporting 55 doctoral students over eight years in the design, deployment and evaluation of community-driven digital technologies and services through, for example, the redesign of local services with communities, and the development of at-scale platforms which allow citizens to engage with local government, and
commission their own services (http://digitalcivics.org.uk )
 
? AHRC LEAPFROG (Cruickshank). Co-designing new tools and approaches to facilitate new creative engagement activities in the public sector. The models of Creative Exchange are now being applied to the N8 consortium programme driving clusters of KE and Research under the Urban Living theme (Cooper lead for N8) and Creative and Digital theme (Coulton lead for N8) with support for KE from Professor Cruickshank (director KE on CX).
 
Furthermore, the PhD model is now embedded in the partner organisations and will be further developed and applied. Anticipated impact is also international as we continue to share the model with other universities, for example Gothenburg University and IE University Madrid via staff visits.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>3359FC67-C768-4521-97E4-001F8C6CEC78</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56de96fef0d957.78546280</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>For NESTA we (Andrew Sleigh, Kathleen Stokes, Hannah Stewart) created an open dataset of UK makerspaces.

The invitation was open to both academics and creative industry representatives who had an interest in this area and digital public space including architects, artists, technologists, social studies and urbanism academics and many others.

The goal of the activity was not only to create project concepts but also to build relationships and successful cross-sector interdisciplinary teams. When designing the experience and activities, our priorities based on previous learnings across the Creative Exchange were to provide a safe environment with all partners on equal footing, and to provide engaging experiences that would spark idea generation and form research teams. 

A process of iterative development informed the design of specific tools to meet these goals. These tools included tangible objects to facilitate mechanisms of collaboration. Tools included: 'Hearts and Hats', 'Link Map', 'Thematic Walk', 'Partners Pie' and the 'Journey Booklet'.</gtr:description><gtr:id>72BB8962-43D3-44EF-A705-0E0E8BA81D42</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As a result of this event two collaborative projects were funded through The Creative Exchange:

Near Miss: this collaboration between the University of Westminster and SME Blaze ran a national digital survey on cycling 'near misses' and their impact on cyclists. It held a summation workshop with key stakeholders in this area to present the research outcomes and produced a report which has gained significant coverage in the UK press. They have now secured additional funding to extend the survey and include international aspects.

Paths of Desire: this involves researchers from Lancaster University, Manchester Metropolitan University and the University of Kent as well as Lancaster City Council, a digital design company and a fine artist. They are developing a new map application which displays locations based on experiences and interests of users. This unique prototype app is in final development stages and will be developed further by the SME partner.

Additional informal connections have been made and sustained between participants forming the basis of a network of collaborations who continue to discuss shared topics and may enable future working.

Long term impacts of this project include the learning which has been retained within The Creative Exchange both in terms of working practices for the doctoral students and methods taken forward to other ideation and collaboration workshops and events. The tools themselves may also be transferrable to other contexts and we are exploring cross sector opportunities for this.

A key outcome of this was to set a precedent for an exciting and engaging event to bring people together beyond the traditional workshop or conference with stratified hierarchies and less opportunity for broad collaboration.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d04ea00ec000.17142100</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Creative Lounge tools</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>NewsDrop is a toolkit for supporting community journalism of parliamentary debates. It uses a physical installation that displays a live news paper, authored by community journalists through an online news production tool. The production tool aggregates related news, BBC programmes using iPlayer and twitter.

National news coverage of Parliamentary debate is inherently non-local specific content and often communities are affected by these issues and are left without an outlet to discuss these issues. NewsDrop was envisaged as a way in which communities can become more aware of this discussion through supporting local community journalists in aggregating and disseminating local news about Parliamentary debates.</gtr:description><gtr:id>D62197BF-F5ED-418E-BA88-FA506788BD48</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The prototype was exhibited at the #NewsHack 2013 event to leading media industry experts which resulted in winning the award for best academic submission.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d989368892b4.14955207</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>NewsDrop: a toolkit for supporting community journalism of parliamentary debates</gtr:title><gtr:type>Physical Model/Kit</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://hack.sbl.io</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>Web based platform for connecting creative practice: A collection of creative projects using digital technologies to explore local heritage, place and memory.</gtr:description><gtr:id>833C2DBF-9BAE-40DA-989B-63D419A3B84F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This output formed part of The Creative Exchange, a broad programme of activities with notable impact in multiple areas.

Up to 300 people can connect simultaneously, the swarm of tiny speakers creates a collection of overlapping sound sources enabling listeners to gain a unique spatial perspective on their shared environment. Each phone also becomes a visual medium, screens flashing from white to black as sound is played. Coupled with the audio this creates an ever changing flickering of light and sound throughout the performance space.

The seamless designed website invites users to dive into the collection and enables the experience of serendipity while browsing through artefacts. Adapting the users' scrolling speed the interface either keeps displaying related items or presents random new topics. Storing items that have been clicked on the website allows users to go back in their browsing experience. Also, a map view presents all items that are stored and their relations to each other.

We'll show you on a handy map all of the places near you that have been reviewed by other mothers. We've also carefully designed FeedFinder so that it can be used one-handed as much as possible so that you can even be adding a review of a breastfeeding place as you breastfeed your little one.

You can use FeedFinder to find places around you where other mothers have had positive breastfeeding experiences. Every recommended place on the map will have been reviewed by someone who's breastfeeding. You'll be able to see not only how they have rated that place, but also any handy comments that they have added about their experience or the location, like whether they have toys and a menu for toddlers, or where the breastfeeding room is if it's a bit difficult to find.

If you can't find somewhere near you, or have found a new gem be sure to add the new place to the map. You'll find the process easy and convenient with FeedFinder doing most the hard work, like locating the place on the map, or adding the address details - all you'll need to do is add a star rating and your own comments.

FeedFinder is part of a research project based at the Digital Interaction group in Newcastle University, UK. Check out http://feed-finder.co.uk for more details about how we store, collect and use your anonymised data.</gtr:description><gtr:id>7E4C93AF-B334-481E-BCC8-E8E9F084727E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The FeedFinder application has been widely received within the UK and further afield.

In this Game Jam we attempted to capture the values of play from our childhood and party games. In order to do this, we created the i-dentity game which was built upon the childhood play of &amp;quot;What time is it, Mr. Wolf&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Sleeping Lions&amp;quot;.

In our game, four players that benefits from being played in front of an audience (Fig. 1). It is played with a set of Sony Move controllers and no screen. Players assume the role of an interrogator or one of three spies. The three spies each hold a Move controller. One Move controller is randomly selected by the game to represent the spies' leader. The leader's movements illuminate all three of the spies' controllers, while the spies' movements are ignored. Vibration feedback is discretely sent to the leader's controller when moved to let him/her know his/her role in the game. The leader's role is only known amongst the spies themselves.

The interrogator, whose goal is to identify the spies' leader, conducts or asks the spies to perform movements. For example, we observed commands such as asking the group to jump up and down, they could be asked to &amp;quot;pretend they had just been shot&amp;quot;, or to play air guitar. However, the interrogator can only address the spies together, as a group (so the interrogator cannot say &amp;quot;only the person in the middle should jump&amp;quot;). While the leader moves through acting out a command, everyone's light turns on. When the leader is stationary the lights go out. The spies copy their movements in an attempt to identify whose movements control the light. The game continues until the interrogator believes she/he knows the identity of the spies' leader. At this stage, the interrogator points towards the leader. The chosen leader waves their controller; if all the spies' controllers illuminate, the interrogator wins and the spies and interrogator switch roles, otherwise the leader and the spies win. Players often agreed upon a limit to the amount of commands that could be asked before requiring the interrogator to select a leader.</gtr:description><gtr:id>B7B87F2F-D158-4A8D-ACFB-37A3BF3B490A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The value of i-dentity has been its use as a digital tool to explore how movement in digital games is represented. To this end, we wrote software upon the PS3 Move Library that allowed a Mac OSX machine to connect to a number of PlayStation Controllers. This software now provides an exemplar of how you can write a game to use the PS3 Move controllers. These controllers represent one future of digital game control where the most important thing is the body-space, exercise and social engagement rather than being placed in front of a display and being given a prescriptive game experience.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>546384ee017cc8.79979855</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>i-dentity - Gavin Wood</gtr:title><gtr:type>Software</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://github.com/baawolf</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>Haemodialysis patients in the UK usually undergo routine monthly blood tests which support the medical team in assessing their ongoing condition.

The game resurrects the mythical Wild Man of Belsay who features in the Middleton family's coat of arms. With location beacons hidden around the rooms, the experience is played through visitors' mobile phones, the voice of the Wild Man guiding them through challenges and responding to the players' actions as they explore the old hall.

This app takes users into a different time and place where wild creatures roam the rooms of Belsay Hall, challenging them to creep carefully through the halls to surprise the Wild Man - who listens and feels their every move.

Typically visitors get their information via audio headsets or information boards but these are very isolating and don't encourage people to engage either with each other or their surroundings. The aim of the Wild Man Game is to get people to look beyond the mobile phone and explore their environment in a way they wouldn't otherwise, immersing themselves in the history rather than simply looking at it from a distance.

The players in the game do not have to follow a set route around the house or look at things in a certain order. Instead it is about exploring in your own time and in your own way as the game develops around you.</gtr:description><gtr:id>FF02D2B5-68CE-4E63-83D8-39856D5609AE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The augmented reality software from this App have been used in the Labella app which has achieved considerable success in the upcoming CHI 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56daf244b23387.33370834</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>The Wild Man Game</gtr:title><gtr:type>Webtool/Application</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>This algorithmic software was developed to generate unique shapes from the conferences hashtag twitter data.

Together they looked at how to design empathy and community into an open hardware product development life cycle. The central concern and motivator for the project and its research approach was civic wellbeing, bringing a new angle to the timely topic of wearable devices and open data, including demographics outside the usual young technology aware user base. There is a lot of data that is about individuals but not a lot of data that is for individuals and their communities. Numbers that Matter aimed to design more meaningful ways of accessing and building with that data - not limited to designing for the tech elite of early adopters and instead responding to the day-to-day needs and concerns of a locality. The Numbers That Matter project held a Hackathon in March 2014. The winner of this hackathon, with financial and business development support from The Creative Exchange, went on to found a startup company Made With Glove developing heated glove wearable devices, and was shortlisted for The Pitch top 100, Britain's biggest small business competition. http://www.thepitch.uk/shortlist/made-withglove-ltd/220. After receiving a &amp;pound;5,000 innovation voucher from Innovate UK to conduct prefeasibility studies, the company founder Michelle Hua is now applying for the SMART funding through Innovate UK and hopes to launch a commercial product during 2016. &amp;quot;Creative Exchange have been very supportive in progressing my idea to prototype stage. While the funding itself was to bring an idea to prototype stage, I have received more than a prototype which has added great value to my business. The value, I believe, has been in making the right connections and meeting the right people to support my business. This is so important in every entrepreneur's journey. I was invited to attend and exhibit my prototype at the Prime Conference at the Royal Institution of Great Britain. I was inspired by all the speakers and made valuable connections with people from the industry. I was also invited to attend the AHRC and Innovate UK meeting in London to discuss ways in which AHRC and Innovate UK can have better relationships and how Innovate UK can better service its customers. We also addressed the challenges of small and micro businesses' access to Innovate UK. Being a startup entrepreneur, it was very interesting learning about the issues of funding from the funder's perspective. I was invited to showcase my prototype at the Innovate UK exhibition at Old Billingsgate in London with over 2000 international delegates, providing me with many opportunities for my business. The support along the way from the team has been invaluable, answering questions in relation to funding, business ideas, models and introducing me to networks of contacts as well as discussing and brainstorming ideas. It has been a positive experience and I am grateful for the support.&amp;quot; Michelle Hua</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>57305d247930f1.71395749</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:url>http://www.michellehua.co.uk/made-with-glove</gtr:url><gtr:yearCompanyFormed>2014</gtr:yearCompanyFormed></gtr:spinOutOutput><gtr:spinOutOutput><gtr:companyName>Red Ninja</gtr:companyName><gtr:description>Red Ninja is a Liverpool-based design-led technology company, who collaborated on the Open Planning project with Liverpool University academics, Liverpool City Council and two Creative Exchange doctoral researchers.</gtr:description><gtr:id>2C5B2212-540E-4CBA-9981-081D3EBF4C16</gtr:id><gtr:impact>When they started working with Creative Exchange they were, in their own words, 'a bootstrapped tech start up with 3 staff and little track record of working directly with local authorities and universities'. Not only did the Open Planning project develop an innovative app for new perspectives on engaging with the urban planning process, it caused significant shifts in the business practices of Red Ninja and their approach to collaborative work. Lee Omar, the CEO, describes the impact on the company as follows: &amp;quot;Having direct access to work with a local authority in a paid capacity gave us confidence and credibility, which enabled us to design and develop a solution that enables more visibility for citizens living in urban environments.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;The Creative Exchange process was fantastic for us as we invested much more of our own time into the project to enable us to produce IP that we could commercialise. The learning of working with the city data sets as part of the Creative Exchange has enabled us to design and develop commercial products with a multinational energy company on a smart energy platform that will enable sustainable urban developments. Commercially this was valuable to us and is worth ten times the financial reward than the Creative Exchange project. This validates the extra work we did on the Creative Exchange project.&amp;quot; Since engaging with Creative Exchange, Red Ninja employs five times as many staff and their turnover has increased six fold. The company is also continuing the collaborative approach to work, sponsoring a programme of PhD students embedded within their practices and developing their own research arm. Additionally, as a direct result of things learned from the Open Planning project, Creative Exchange is funding a new twelve-month collaboration to develop a new platform by which public data (such as that held by city councils) can be held and provided back to relevant parties in a way that can be truly open and beneficial. It will involve working with current data handling companies to develop a new system, with the aim of scaling it across the country. It will initially be trialled in three cities: Manchester, Lancaster and Liverpool.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>57305c51a1a145.73099249</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:url>http://www.redninja.co.uk</gtr:url><gtr:yearCompanyFormed>2011</gtr:yearCompanyFormed></gtr:spinOutOutput></gtr:spinOutOutputs></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A44BA7DB-F6BF-4B6C-8720-0A353FF51537</gtr:id><gtr:title>What
