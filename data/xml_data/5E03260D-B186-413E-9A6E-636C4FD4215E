The obese state is dangerous as it makes the children more prone to a series of diseases including heart and blood problem, diabetes and even some types of cancer. Recent studies found that low physical activity and quite high consumption of fast food and soft drinks were among the main causes. The research team has planned for a program to tackle this problem at junior high schools around the city. The program consists of four weekly education sessions of why and how to choose food &amp;amp; drinks healthily and also how to be more physically active. Additionally, the program includes a school and online support system to help maintain the effort of the students. Both of the education sessions and the support system are run by the star students (peer leaders) to take advantage of the influence between the children themselves. This first small-scale project is for the purpose of checking the acceptance of the students, their teachers and their family members and the possibility of success in school settings for the future larger program in Ho Chi Minh City. This purpose is achieved through the results of interviews and group discussions with the students, the peer leaders, the teachers and the parents.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Overweight and obesity in junior high school students have been rising sharply in the past decade in Ho Chi Minh City. Obesity in these adolescents increased the risk of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and even some types of cancer later in life. Recent findings from previous local cohort and observations revealed several possible causes including the low level of physical activity and medium to higher consumption of fast food and sugar-sweetened beverages among these students. The research team has planned for an intervention to help students change their lifestyles into healthier and more active ones. This intervention consists of four sessions of nutrition and physical activity education program followed by a school-based and online support system. The innovative focus point in this study is that both education and support system are run and managed by peer leaders of the students themselves who can potentially have more influence among the adolescent community. This initial study is a pilot of intervention with the objectives of assessing the acceptability of the students, their teachers, and their parents and also the feasibility of larger scale intervention in school setting in HCMC. The objectives of this pilot will be measured through qualitative interviews and focus group discussions along and after the intervention.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>This pilot study is a major setup for later full-scale intervention to tackle three issues the low level of physical activity, the increased time spent in sedentary behaviours and high-energy dietary patterns (including fast food and sugar-sweetened beverages) of the junior high school students. At this stage, the research team believes that the people who benefit the most are the students and the peer leaders of the intervention program because they will have the greatest chance to have a more precise understanding of nutrition and physical activity to make a better decision to maintain the healthy life. Their family members including parents and any sisters or brothers living in the same household are also benefited from the child who is attending the intervention school as there is a section of the education program which also encourages the student to spread knowledge and to inspire others to be active. At the school level, teachers will be informed and they will increase the preparedness to help children actively prevent obesity through healthier lifestyles. Also, the Department of Education of Ho Chi Minh City will have another method/approach to engage the child obesity.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-07-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-07-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>148294</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/R004587/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>7C58A707-1BF6-4573-A44F-30B271C80813</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cancer</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>D4FDB752-4E9C-491F-9C63-B7D7F6F95417</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cardiovascular</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>160D22D0-5677-4513-A0AC-7F3526B7F336</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Metabolic and Endocrine</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>D81A471F-556F-4570-BF6A-5D197943223C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Oral and Gastrointestinal</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>A77DAE3A-499B-4F46-971D-6C82F51F9C2E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Stroke</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>5841ECCD-C9B1-4B8B-993F-ACC8E9585125</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>3.1  Primary preventions interventions to modify behaviours or promote well-being</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
