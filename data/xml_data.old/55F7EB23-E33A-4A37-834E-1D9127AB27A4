I have developed a particularly powerful invertebrate model system that permits us to couple quantitative movement analyses with a range of extracellular and intracellular recoding techniques in animals that carry out their normal behaviour. We will focus on two main issues. First, we will analyse plasticity in aimed scratching movements and underlying neuronal networks, across three time scales. Second, we will test the hypothesis that regulation of leg joint stiffness is critical for successful aiming towards a target. To analyse plasticity, we will first define the ability of locusts to modify their movement kinematics in response to instantaneous changes in body orientation, leg loading or leg damage. Locusts are marked with retroreflective markers that define the body and leg, and the movements are videotaped. We use customised motion capture software to process the images and automatically detect the limb movements so that we can generate very large datasets for analysis. From the movement kinematics we use inverse dynamics calculations to compute the joint torques, which will be related to the patterns of motor activity recorded extracellularly from the leg muscle using standard techniques. We have already implemented the basic features or the inverse dynamics procedure in a Matlab program. Once we have defined the mechanisms underlying the rapid compensation, we will examine how the behaviour and neuronal control networks are recalibrated over hours and weeks following various perturbations, including limb damage and precise surgical manipulation of proprioceptive feedback from an identified joint receptor. We have already developed the surgical technique, and will use standard electrophysiological methods to record the responses of the sensory neurons. To analyse developmental plasticity at the time of the last moult into adulthood, we will compare movements kinematics and patterns of motor activity in the same individuals before and after moulting. We will use paired intracellular and extracellular recordings, and dye backfilling to define the patterns of branching and synaptic connectively of juvenile and adult wing hair sensory neurones. To analyse joint stiffness we will make direct measurements of the forces required to perturb the limb during an active movement. To do so will require the development of a miniature closed feedback torque-controller. This will be technically challenging, so we also plan to calculate joint stiffness from measurements made using standard force transducers in a much simpler setup. We will also record intracellularly from the leg motor neurones restrained and perhaps reduced preparation so that we can control their firing rates and manipulate joint stiffness directly. These motor neurones are among the largest in the ventral nerve cord, and are routinely recorded in my laboratory. A leg will be loaded by the addition of small lead weights, and the effects on movement kinematics, dynamics, and motor patterns measured as described above. We will use a laser photoablation method to destroy the 3 inhibitory leg motor neurones to test directly their role in modulating joint stiffness. We have proven experience in the key techniques that we wish to use, and have developed new methods to increase the power of our approach. Our results will demonstrate clearly how sensory-motor transformations are adapted over time, and how limb mechanics interact with neuronal control systems to guide aimed limb movements. These outcomes will advance our understanding of nervous system functioning, and will guide the design of autonomous legged robots.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-07-22</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-01-23</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>369442</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>I am not aware of directly attributable applied 'use' of this work to date, but this is very difficult to ascertain.</gtr:description><gtr:id>C1722002-3EDC-4968-8E36-27C538568BAC</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>5450f871425f39.47252266</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The broad goal of our work is to develop an understanding of how nervous systems control aimed limb movements. We work with insects (locusts) in which we can couple precise measurements of aimed leg movements with a range of methods for measuring and manipulating nerve cell function in animals that carry out their normal behaviour. We analyse aimed scratching movements made in response to gentle touch on the wing surface. We have focussed on two related issues: (1) a determination of the muscle and limb properties that drive movements; and (2) changes in nerve cell function following changes in the load on a limb, or limb damage, or during development when the wing and limb shape change. We have shown that surgical manipulation of an internal sense organ that signals limb joint position systematically alters aimed movements made by the limb. This demonstrates that the particular sense organ is key to the control of the limb. Moreover, the movements recover within 7 days, demonstrating a remarkable adaptability in the nervous system. This work was published in the Journal of Neuroscience 29: 3897-3907. 2009). We have shown that an inhibitory motor nerve cell that affects the functioning of limb muscles becomes active prior to movement. Artificially manipulating the cell's activity demonstrates that it acts to increase limb velocity without affecting accuracy. It does this by increasing the rate at which the muscles can relax, which prevents a build up in tension of opposing muscles at a joint. We have shown that passive forces within the limb make a significant contribution to aimed movements, so that in some cases movements occur even when there is no active muscle contraction (Journal of Neurophysiology 99: 484-499. 2008). We have characterised the muscle properties underlying these passive forces and will use these measurements to develop further our computer model of the limb. This model will in turn enable us to test further ideas about the control of limb movements in a range of conditions that are difficult to test experimentally. We have shown that there is a highly organised internal representation of sensory signals that gives rise to the aimed movements. The distribution of the sensory receptors (on the wings) changes during development and we relate this to developmental changes in the aimed movements. We have also shown that aimed limb movements of upside-down locusts are fully compensated against the effects of gravity, and that animals whose limbs are damaged during development aim the remaining stump of the limb correctly. We have shown how groups of motor nerve cells that drive limb muscle contractions work together under loaded conditions to produce the observed compensation. Our research has supported the training of 4 postdoctoral scientists, both in-house and on external courses, as well as a PhD student and several undergraduate students. It has generated a new collaboration between our lab and an engineering lab that will take the work forward in exciting new ways.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our work could lead to the design of better neuroprostheses or robotic limbs.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B1088E82-A87A-4DEC-9C08-46B4F1B1767B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5450f6ee8750b3.12367620</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>482C52C7-8C01-43CD-9227-76B6A51016D9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Physiological characterisation of a simply innervated insect muscle</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/473db5d5d5a3b0037caed3eefd54899c"><gtr:id>473db5d5d5a3b0037caed3eefd54899c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Clare,A.J.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56e15b8025f177.82240336</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C612A3AF-4DF6-4247-933A-C20F00835A0E</gtr:id><gtr:title>A somewhat neglected aspect of insect neurophysiology.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Journal of experimental biology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/df4f4b15480679707ee858770436bb1f"><gtr:id>df4f4b15480679707ee858770436bb1f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Matheson T</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0022-0949</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5450b546361f19.14777075</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B81916BC-B889-4E07-AF6A-5E1111DF7E21</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Insects -
