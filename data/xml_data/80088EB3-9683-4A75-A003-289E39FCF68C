While much is known of protein-protein and protein-carbohydrate interactions, we lack a detailed understanding of the corresponding carbohydrate-carbohydrate interactions (CCIs). These are, nevertheless, important in a wide range of biological contexts, e.g. fertilisation, cell-cell recognition and cell adhesion. A major issue associated with the study of CCIs is that they are inherently weak. For this reason, most work to date has been done within multivalent systems where many weak carbohydrate-based associations act cooperatively to provide an overall strong interaction (avidity). The best analogy for this is Velcro, where many little hooks with little individual strength, act together to provide immense combined sticking power. However, multivalent environments are necessarily macroscopic, and it is hard to probe the detail of the specific interactions involved; to retain the Velcro analogy, how do the hooks line up and which features of the hooks are important and which are not? For instance, we know that small changes in carbohydrate structure do lead to changes (either a gain or loss) of CCIs. However, the details how chemical/structural changes in the carbohydrate components translate to binding affinities is not understood. Our strategy to tackle this problem is new and is based on tethering (constraining) carbohydrate units on to a peptide scaffold which will encourage them to interact with one another. As our primary assay, we have designed sensitive systems that should respond to and, in turn, allow us to detect CCI's. We have other systems, which are more rigid, that will then allow us to localise carbohydrates and present them to one another, i.e. force them to interact. We will then use a range of spectroscopic methods to study the nature of any interaction with the aim of elucidating more of the molecular detail of the interactions involved. This will then lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms associated with CCIs, which are of fundamental importance in a range of biological environments. Insight into how these processes work (by understanding them at the molecular level), therefore, may then lead to approaches that could allow us to predict and engineer CCIs i.e. enhance or inhibit them, and turn them on or off. In turn, this understanding and the ability to identify and study new CCIs could be used to probe and thereby gain a better understanding of a given biology process. Thus, in essence, the long-term aim of this work is to contribute to our fundamental understanding of CCIs, which has implications for our knowledge of how nature uses this weak but important process, and to achieve this we propose a new approach to tackle the challenges that this field presents.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>351648</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>29700</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>University of Bristol</gtr:description><gtr:fundingOrg>University of Bristol</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>HoD PDRA</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>7AECF6A7-26E8-438F-B426-E07717A4F4F9</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5ee20c5e5ee20c7c</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Our goal in this project is to study, and in this way understand more fully, the ways in which a carbohydrate interacts with other carbohydrate units.

For example, carbohydrates associated with proteins or cell surfaces.

Our strategy to tackle this problem is new and is based on tethering (constraining) carbohydrate units on to a peptide scaffold which will encourage them to interact with one another. As our primary assay, we have designed sensitive systems that should respond to and, in turn, allow us to detect CCI's. We have other systems, which are more rigid, that will then allow us to localise carbohydrates and present them to one another, i.e. &amp;quot;force&amp;quot; them to interact. 

We used a range of spectroscopic methods to calibrate using a complex saccharide already associated with a CCI (based on a complex sugar called Lewis x) and then studied the nature of any interaction with the aim of elucidating more of the molecular detail of the interactions involved. This necessarily required a comprehensive set of control experiments because the interaction being observed is weak and it is imperative that we were able to determine the presence of a real effect. We think we have achieved this and that we have, and for the first time, observed a single CCI. While this remains a qualitative determination, this work lays a foundation for looking at other carbohydrates. These, and this work is underway but incomplete, taking individual fragments of Lewis x (in other words combinations of components) to identify exactly which structural/molecular features underpin the CCI effect. This will lead ultimately to a better understanding of the mechanisms associated with CCIs, which are of fundamental importance in a range of biological environments. Insight into how these processes work (by understanding them at the molecular level), therefore, may then lead to approaches that could allow us to predict and engineer CCIs i.e. enhance or inhibit them, and turn them on or off.

Indeed this is a methodology that could also be used to probe other very weak, but important, interactions. Within the CCI context we recognise that we are look at &amp;quot;cis&amp;quot; as opposed to &amp;quot;trans&amp;quot; interactions (where &amp;quot;trans&amp;quot; refers to intermolecular interactions) and extending these studies to the &amp;quot;trans&amp;quot; series (where metal-based interactions are believed to be important) would be important. 
The weak nature of the CCIs inevitably challenges methods for probing them but equally, and as carbohydrates become more important as the basis of new therapeutics, the need to understand what drives CCI and related interactions becomes essential. In our own work we have now recognised the role of other types of interaction based on the (to date not widely appreciated) hydrophobic regions of carbohydrate surfaces (which is a key driver for CCI) and this has led to new studies to probe the occurrence and importance of e.g. carbohydrate-protein C-H/pi interactions.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C725A45C-ACD7-47A9-ADE3-2397E8E9C2CF</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d8272ddc0a11.80574825</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8AB66766-5930-4116-B793-786F42C3477E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Random-coil:a-helix equilibria as a reporter for the Lewis(X)-Lewis(X) interaction.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/26c6e48b78fe82ec92bf4a5e25bb245f"><gtr:id>26c6e48b78fe82ec92bf4a5e25bb245f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Altamore TM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1433-7851</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5649f4e7e13a78.33417970</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/E038662/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F442B6BE-8B89-4C01-8D3B-E8A4D320B672</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>80</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biomolecules &amp; biochemistry</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>60EBB420-734E-4DB5-B0F2-65A1115A27F8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical synthesis</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>0B9701E7-D17F-4963-82DA-B3926A65B50A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biological &amp; Medicinal Chem.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>731E9FEC-8A1C-4A39-A68A-A4E20E5B1CC4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Carbohydrate Chemistry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>02567418-12CB-462E-9092-530C6E63B359</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical Biology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
