Funding has been received from the ESRC to support three workshops with the aim of consolidate and build further an international collaborative network of leading researchers engaged in the study of youth transitions in the context of&amp;nbsp; long reaching economic and social change. To examine the processes involved in navigating the transition to adulthood in difficult times and how these may differ across different countries, the network will use longitudinal data from Household Panel and cohort studies collected in the UK, Germany and the USA. The three workshops will address the following issues:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>identification and evaluation of comparative measures and indicators of youth transitions, their antecedents and associated outcomes in the three countries&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>data harmonisation and sharing of data across countries&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>developing a conceptual and methodological framework for the comparative study of youth transitions&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>review and debate of advances in statistical methodology for application in the research.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>There are five key groups who will benefit from the networks' programme: academics from a range of disciplines; early career researchers and PhD students; policy makers in national and local government and related agencies and think tanks; educational professionals and practitioners; the wider public. The impact plan will focus on directly reaching all five of them. Through informing and influencing these groups, and inviting them to the workshops, we would hope to create a 'trickle-down' effect which would impact on all potential beneficiaries.

The proposed activities of the network address directly three of the current ESRC strategic priorities, i.e. health and wellbeing, understanding individual behaviour, and social diversity and population dynamics. The network's programme will add value and maximise the international scientific, economic and societal impact of current work through international collaboration, providing access to data resources and expertise from overseas, and creating an ongoing international and interdisciplinary research network. It will facilitate capacity building and support the next generation of world-class researchers engaged in the use of longitudinal data sets by creating opportunities for networking and exchange of ideas among early career researchers and senior staff involved in state-of-the art research at highly prestigious institutions. 

The research conducted will help answer questions about the causal processes that lead to positive and negative adaptations to economic stress. Developing a better understanding of these causal pathways can:
a) support improved quality and better targeting of services directed at young people 
b) provide evidence to inform current policies focused on improving life chances of those whose transitions are the most problematic such as for those leaving school early, those not in education employment or training (NEET), teenaged parents and carers, etc.
c) raise awareness of the factors that have a positive impact on youth transitions and their outcomes in education employment, family life, citizenship and health 

The insights gained will be of immense value to policy makers, offering a comparative framework against which UK policy initiatives aiming to support young people in the time of economic crisis can be set against those of other countries. Government priorities, such as developing apprenticeship as the main transition route for young people not going to university can be viewed against shifts in the willingness of employers to take on young people, the changing levels of government support available, and how these vary internationally. Those working in the Education, Youth, Social and Health services will gain better understanding of how to target and adapt their provision to young people's need, and employers how to improve and target better their recruitment and training. 

The findings will be disseminated widely across social science, policy and practice. In addition to presenting them at national conferences and workshops and publishing them in peer reviewed journals, a 'main findings' research summary will be made accessible to the general public via our website and the media. Other users of the longitudinal datasets will be alerted to the findings through e-newsletters posted on the relevant websites. Through the research centres participating in the network there is extensive experience of effective means of communicating longitudinal research findings in an easily accessible manner, and the means of accessing the data on which the findings are based that will be capitalised on to the full.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>25102</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The findings of our research group are relevant for academics from a range of disciplines (including early career researchers), policy makers, educational professionals and the wider public aiming to steer the institutionalised pathways and interventions aiming to prepare young people for making the step into adulthood and obtaining economic independence in a global context. 

To reach our target audience we held three international workshops aimed at academics (described in the section on Key Findings), a policy workshop at the Cabinet Office, and engaged in different dissemination activities to reach a wider audience, including educational professionals and the wider public:

In April 2013 we were invited to the Cabinet Office to present and discuss our findings with policy makers and researchers. The findings have influenced further debates among policy makers regarding the improvement of vocational training and competence development of young people (focus on cognitive as well as social and emotional skills).

In May 2013 Schoon was invited by the Education and Employer Task Force to give a presentation on Young People's career expectations and their impact on the transition to 
adulthood. The presentation stimulated discussions with professional organisations and teachers about how to prepare young people for a changing future and how to engage 
employers in education. http://www.educationandemployers.org/research/young-peoples-career-expectations-and-their-impact-on-the-transition-to-adulthood/ 

In September 2013 Schoon was invited to give a Keynote at the Penn State' Annual Symposium on Family Issues, on 'Diverging Pathways: Rethinking the Transition to Adulthood'. The paper was commented on by US academic colleagues and published in a book edited by P. Amato, A. Booth, S. McHale, &amp;amp; J. Van Hook in 2015 providing opportunity for further knowledge exchanges with international academics, policy makers, and other interested organisations. http://www.pop.psu.edu/event/587/21st-annual-symposium-family-issues-%E2%80%93-diverging-destinies-families-era-increasing-inequality 

In 2014 the network published a Special Section in Longitudinal and Life Course Studies, edited by Jeylan Mortimer, on Youth, economic hardship, and the worldwide &amp;quot;Great Recession&amp;quot;. The special section included seven contributions from our network and has reached a wide international readership. http://www.llcsjournal.org/index.php/llcs/issue/view/26 

In September 2014 Schoon was invited to give a keynote for the 1st International Conference of the Berlin Interdisciplinary Education Research Network (BIEN) at the Deutsches Institute f&amp;uuml;r Wirtschaft (DIW), Berlin, I.: Preparing for the Transition to Adulthood: The role of school experiences. The discussions highlighted in particular the effectiveness of supporting so-called non-cognitive skills, such as school motivation, self-regualtion and self awareness to facilitate a smooth school-to-work transition and stimulated plans for collaborative and comparative research among interdisciplinary teams of educational researchers and professionals. http://bien-edu.net/1-bien-jahrestagung-hat-stattgefunden/ 

In October 2014 Schoon was invited to give a keynote on ' Making it Against the Odds: Diverse Strategies and Successful Adaptation' at the SRCD special topic meeting on Positive Youth Development in Prague, stimulating discussion and debate with international scholars and policy makers about a global response to young people's experiences in the great recession. A book publication of the proceedings (edited by Anne Petersen) is currently in preparation http://www.srcd.org/sites/default/files/documents/invited_program_summary.pdf 

In January 2015 Schoon was invited to deliver a Masterclass on 'Becoming Adults in the 21st Century Britain: Rethinking transitions to adulthood' to the Department of Business, Innovation and Skill (BIS) at Westminster (with Karen Evans) - which had 142 views. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5c3orR4KDg?dex=2&amp;amp;list=PLBKSiHxV0EKb_Q7divA1mhGLOJEssoKIl

In July 2015 Bynner and Schoon received a contract from Cambridge University Press to publish a book on 'Young People's Development and the Great Recession: Uncertain Transitions and Precarious Futures'. The book will comprise contributions of the workshops as well as a final discussion and evaluation with comments from Glen Elder and Walter Heinz.

Also in July 2015 a call went out for a special issue on young people and the Great Recession in the International Journal of Psychology, to be edited by Ingrid Schoon and Jeylan Mortimer http://oowsection.org/2015/07/23/call-for-papers-a-proposal-for-a-special-section-in-the-international-journal-of-psychology/ 

In October 2015 Schoon organised a symposium on 'Transitions to Adulthood in Context' at the conference of the International Society for Longitudinal and Life Course Studies in Dublin. http://www.slls.org.uk/#!programme/cxv2 

In January 2016 Schoon was invited to join a Plenary debate on 'inequality in educational transitions' at an International Conference organized by the College for Interdisciplinary Educational Research at the Social Science Centre (WZB ), Berlin. http://www.ciderweb.org/conference 

In April 2016 Schoon (Ingrid) and Lyons-Amos (mark) published a paper on ' Diverse pathways in becoming an adult: the role of structure, agency and context.' in Research in Social Stratification and Mobility. ISSN 02765624. http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0276562416300178

In May 2016 was asked to give advise the Department for Work and Pensions on how to support competence development among adolescents and young adults, focusing on vulnerable young people and those at risk of NEET

In June 2016 Schoon was invited to give a Keynote Lecture on 'Making it against the odds: diverse strategies and successful adaptation in school-to-work transitions in England' at the Llakes Research Conference 'Growing Up and Global Austerity: comparing youth opportunities, aspirations and civic values around the world

In June 2016 Schoon also was invited to give a keynote lecture on 'Diverse Strategies and Successful Adaptation in the Transition to Adulthood' at the International Conference on Beliefs and Behavior in Education and Culture, West University of Timisoara, Romania

In January 2017 Schoon in collaboration with Jeylan Mortimer edited a special section on 'Youth and the Great Recession - are values, achievement orientation and outlook to the future affected?' in the International Journal of Psychology, 52(1), 1-8

In January 2017 Schoon was asked to provide advice to the Department for Work on Pensions regarding the specification of a family life course framework related to the development of the Social Justice Green Paper</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>749C1878-CAFF-49B4-8B6D-18CEC2CAE4FB</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5463b5fd4bdb51.82289841</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We held 2 international workshops at the Institute of Education in London, 1 workshop at the University of Bremen, and 1 policy workshop at the Cabinet Office. 

In the first workshop we assessed the comparability of markers of the transition to adulthood, their antecedents and associated outcomes in the UK, US and Germany using information from panel study data. The findings suggest that some indicators, such as education and partnership are more difficult to compare than others, such as employment or parenthood. Furthermore, the economic downturn appears to have had different effects in different countries, and varied for different age groups. The Great Recession has to be understood as a variable feature of the current epoch, and government policy and the prevailing international macroeconomic circumstances are key drivers of the emerging development of the next generations. 

The second workshop focused on issues related to the analysis and teasing out of pre-existing trends and direct recession effects on young people's education and employment trajectories. The use of regional indicators and employment statistics as well as macro level indicators of GDP and low growth, suggests variations in response to the recession, pointing to pockets of resilience versus deep vulnerability and a growing precariat experiencing long spells of career instability.

The third workshop examined the wider effects of the recession on youth transitions, focusing not only on participation in education and employment, independent living, partnership and family formation, but also on psycho-social outcomes, such as health, aspirations, outlook to the future and civic engagement. The findings from the presentations suggest that the effect of the recession has been relatively small (compared to pre-existing trends), is not consistent across outcomes, and varies by countries and for different subgroups of the population. They point to the role of institutional levers as well as individual characteristics in shaping opportunities. Across the different studies education appears to be a significant predictor of subsequent demographic behaviour.

The policy workshop stimulated a debate especially regarding the importance of sub group analysis, the role of churning during the period of first labour market entry, and the implications for longer term outcomes in the labour market. Another issue concerned the skills and qualifications needed during the economic downturn for enabling flexible response to economic ebbs and flows, and the perceptions and attitudes of young people towards work, different types of work, and receipt of benefits. 

We have addressed some of these issues in more detail in a special section of the Journal of Longitudinal and Life Course Studies. Moreover, and most recently (January 2017) Schoon in collaboration with Mortimer edited a special section in the International Journal of Psychology on 'Youth and the Great Recession - are values, achievement orientation and outlook to the future affected? '. Moreover, new evidence regarding these questions and issues will be presented in an edited book (Schoon and Bynner are joint editors) on Young People's Development and the Great Recession: Uncertain Transitions and Precarious Futures, published by Cambridge University Press (the book is currently in print and will be released in summer 2017). 

Evidence from Europe and the United States suggests that the impact of the recession varies for distinct outcomes and by age, the latter pointing to potential sensitive periods for interventions. Although the direct effects of the recession are not as dramatic as we originally thought, they accelerate pre-existing trends towards more prolonged and precarious transitions to independence, and are likely to bring with them long-term scarring with respect to health and wellbeing. Of special concern are problems of entering the labour market, which now also affect graduates, and the growth of low paid, temporary employment, especially regarding the 'gig' economy. Moreover, while feelings of self-confidence and self-worth have eroded, young people continue to subscribe to the &amp;quot;American Dream,&amp;quot; the belief that in principle it is possible to make it - even if limitations to one's own capabilities are recognised. Trust in institutions has declined, but support and concern for others have increased, suggesting that in times of economic hardship and uncertainty social relationships become more salient. Young people's response to the recession appears to be less of a &amp;quot;me-first&amp;quot; reaction than &amp;quot;let's help each other&amp;quot;: a form of &amp;quot;collective agency&amp;quot; to counter the inadequacy of social safety nets.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We have established a highly motivated international team of researchers and are continuing the study of transition experiences of young people, examining the short- and longer-term impacts of recession effects.

The team has published a special section in in Longitudinal and Life Course Studies comprising seven articles with evidence on the experiences of young people in the recession from the US, UK and Germany. Another special section on 'Youth and the Great Recession - are values, achievement orientation and outlook to the future affected? '(edited by Schoon and Mortimer) has most recently (January 2017) been published by the International Journal of Psychology. 

Furthermore, we now have submitted the manuscript for a book publication on 'Young People's Development and the Great Recession: Uncertain Transitions and Precarious Futures' to our publishers Cambridge University. the book is currently in press and will be out in summer 2017.

The findings were of great interest to the Department of Work and Pensions, and Schoon was invited to a series of advisory meetings. the findings will be used in preparation of the forthcoming Social Justice Green Paper</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>375CF1F3-774B-4D81-A50A-8DFD3B7D6519</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-1749605100.36871317792978c</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>686071C1-3A1F-4119-86F1-9C3AD8FBB3BA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Preface</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Research in Human Development</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/97706c788aab84ada1f3e0e2a96e9ba6"><gtr:id>97706c788aab84ada1f3e0e2a96e9ba6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Buchmann M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>59e35af380b168.49336559</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8A9653D2-2E89-473D-B8EB-354758B6A074</gtr:id><gtr:title>Precursors and consequences of youth poverty in Germany</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Longitudinal and Life Course Studies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/244ad2aa6b9fd38d894f530183698ef3"><gtr:id>244ad2aa6b9fd38d894f530183698ef3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Groh-Samberg O</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5463970f1a1ce6.81176960</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>479A8EBA-47A5-4D79-BFA0-EEC8392704B8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Familial transmission, support, and youth employment in hard economic times</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Longitudinal and Life Course Studies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ef062df26d9104eb0fbbd5eb1c5a66e4"><gtr:id>ef062df26d9104eb0fbbd5eb1c5a66e4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mortimer J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5463960d8debb3.96874071</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5D340421-C848-490F-9A67-FB992B2A6047</gtr:id><gtr:title>Let's Work Together: Towards Interdisciplinary Collaboration</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Research in Human Development</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/3632f4346fb7c5e16aec9faeff15d5fd"><gtr:id>3632f4346fb7c5e16aec9faeff15d5fd</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Schoon I</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>15427617</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58bed1946648b8.20083731</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>36074E12-9DDA-4D27-8DFA-191032D8BF59</gtr:id><gtr:title>Parental worklessness and the experience of NEET among their offspring.
