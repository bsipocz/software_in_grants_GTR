The obvious answer to that question is the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7 1941 - &amp;quot;a date which will live in infamy,&amp;quot; according to President Franklin Roosevelt. In the years immediately preceding the attack, the majority of Americans wanted nothing to do with the ongoing wars in Asia and Europe. However, this research focuses on organised groups of influential American citizens who argued for restrictions on trade with Japan, greater military support to Britain, and even an American declaration of war long before the Hawaiian attack. These internationalist Americans - through groups such as the Committee to Defend America by Aiding the Allies, Fight for Freedom, and the American Committee for Non-Participation in Japanese Aggression - worked to influence both the American Government and the broader American public about the need for greater American involvement in world affairs. They actively promoted a more global role for the United States long before war came to America. 

The first key aim of the research is to create a more accurate definition of American internationalism. While the phrase is commonly used to describe any American involvement in the world (as opposed to isolationism), it has little real meaning unless we try to understand the particular nature of American internationalism. While the main debate in this period was whether the United States should go to war or not, consideration among internationalists of America's post-war role began as early as 1939. From this point onwards, tension can be seen between American interests and its ideals of freedom, democracy and human rights. Tension can also be viewed regarding ideas about international organisation: should the United States do more to work through multilateral institutions such as a revived League of Nations, or should it follow American traditions of unilateralism and avoid entangling alliances? As a result, tensions that later loomed large in America's Cold War foreign policy were clearly foreshadowed even before World War II.

The second key aim is to reassess the roles of the internationalist citizens' organisations and the individuals who led them. Who created and led these internationalist citizens' organisations, and for what purpose? This research reveals an internationalist movement led by an eastern establishment elite, but this was a broad elite that did not speak with a united voice. These elites sought to influence the American government through close personal connections; many had previously worked in government, and many would go on to do so during the war years. They also sought to influence the government by mobilising the American public behind their aims. Internationalists deliberately worked with different sectors of society - women's groups, labour and business organisations, youth groups, and African-Americans - so that they could claim to represent the broadest possible range of the American public. In summary, the organisations acted as an intermediary between the American people and the government in Washington.

The research for this project has been undertaken at a number of archives in the United States. These include governmental records in the US National Archives and the Franklin Roosevelt Library, but also the records of the Committee to Defend America by Aiding the Allies and Fight for Freedom at Princeton University, and the American Committee for Non-Participation in Japanese Aggression records at Harvard University. Additional research in private papers was undertaken at the Library of Congress, Columbia University, New York Public Library, and the University of Virginia.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>As the nature of America's place in the world is a subject of contentious debate, my research has the potential to benefit a range of non-academic audiences. 

The general public will be able to engage with the research, if not through the book then through the media. In September of this year I attended an AHRC New Generation Thinkers Broadcast Media Workshop which has helped me to think about ways my research can engage with the public. Through radio, television and the internet, my research can be presented on its own, or be connected to contemporary events or tied in with historical anniversaries. The significant fact here is vast interest of the British public in the history of World War II. The wartime era remains immensely popular among the wider history reading public, as evidenced through book sales and television documentary coverage. However, the debates that took place within the United States during the 1937-41 period about the nature of its global role, especially while Britain stood alone in 1940 and 1941, are often overlooked in this country. Nevertheless, their significance is enormous for understanding Britain's survival and the part that American military and economic aid played in that survival. My research will therefore counter a popular misconception that the United States was &amp;quot;late&amp;quot; in entering World War II, and raise the quality of popular understanding of this period.

Non-governmental organisations and think tanks and can also benefit from my research, particularly the way it analyses how internationalist organisations worked with both the US Government and also the broader American public. By looking at the ways in which internationalist non-governmental organisations influenced governments in the past, they can draw lessons on their potential influence in the future. My research suggests that citizens' organisations have most influence when they are swimming with a broader tide of public and political opinion. Indeed, the broader tide of opinion is crucial. Even the efforts of internationalist organisations that sought to represent a full cross-section of American opinion were not always fully successful in their aims. Nevertheless, it is clear that non-governmental organisations do have the power to impact on their nation's foreign policy. My research shows that in the World War II era, this was done through the development of a broad-based coalition of popular support that reflected the diversity of the United States. As a result, the need for non-governmental organisations to mobilise popular support, or the illusion of it at the very least, is as important as their connections to government.

Finally, it is possible that policy makers in central government could benefit from my research as it helps to explain the way that the United States acts in the world. In particular, the way my research highlights the competing visions of America's role mapped out immediately prior to 1941, highlights the specific nature of American internationalism. It also helps us to understand the debates and tensions within internationalist thought: should the United States stand as a &amp;quot;city on a hill&amp;quot;, providing an example for others to follow, or should it go out into the world to actively exercise its authority? In an increasingly interconnected world, should it do more to work through multilateral institutions such as the United Nations; or should it follow American traditions of unilateralism and avoid entangling alliances? To what extent is the United States in any way exceptional or benevolent in its diplomacy, or is it driven by narrow national self-interests? More broadly, how successfully has it balanced its own interests with the seemingly universal appeal of ideas of democracy, freedom and human rights? My focus on considerations of multilateralism may also mean this research is of particular interest to international organisations and international non-governmental organisations.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>26314</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This grant enabled me to complete my objectivem, which was to complete a book manuscript. The book, Against Immediate Evil, tells the story of how internationalist-minded Americans worked between 1938 and 1941 to convince the U.S. government and the American public of the need to stem the rising global tide of fascist aggression. As war approached, the internationalist movement attempted to arouse the nation in order to defeat isolationism at home and fascism overseas. Examination of this movement undermines the common belief that the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor wrenched an isolationist United States into global armed conflict.

The book focuses on three organizations-the American Committee for Non-Participation in Japanese Aggression, the Committee to Defend America by Aiding the Allies, and Fight For Freedom-that actively promoted a more global role for the United States based on a conception of the &amp;quot;four freedoms&amp;quot; later made famous by Franklin Roosevelt. The desire to be free from fear was seen in concerns regarding America's immediate national security. The desire to be free from want was expressed in anxieties over the nation's future economic prosperity. The need for freedom of speech was represented in concerns over the potential loss of political freedoms. Finally, the need for freedom of worship was seen in the emphasis on religious freedoms and broader fears about the future of Western civilization. These groups and their supporters among the public and within the government characterized the growing global conflict as one between two distinct worlds and in doing so, set the tone of American foreign policy for decades to come.</gtr:description><gtr:id>F8CB051D-4F15-44ED-86B7-A415C8BAB312</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5447df23520066.22845669</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E03B7A23-15FD-47DC-9CA8-A06E01FE1F82</gtr:id><gtr:title>Against Immediate Evil: American Internationalists and the Four Freedoms on the Eve of World War II</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/42d28c0b03c8501d480d721faab3192f"><gtr:id>42d28c0b03c8501d480d721faab3192f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Johnstone, A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>0-8014-5325-9</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>5447da2801c196.45085906</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/J007617/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6147F869-528E-4716-B75D-1EEFD77024B5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>American Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4CC238CE-229E-47B9-A4BD-01A3E3C7000C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Diplomacy &amp; Internat Relations</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3CE20DB9-873E-489F-BBC7-3F05BD0D900C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
