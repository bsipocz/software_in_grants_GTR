The purpose of this project is to design, implement and make market ready the operational software and inclusive user interface for the Voicekey mTrust mobile commerce trusted mtrader scheme.

The introduction of mcommerce products into an already crowded small value transaction processing market has many obstacles to overcome in order to attain market acceptance. Alternatives such as Chip and Pin, as well as its wireless derivative Pay-wave, are well established and many consumers will be reluctant to take up alternatives that are seen as either less secure or more complicated to process. Add to this the issues associated with the accessability of mobile applications and it is possible that mcommerce will find it difficult to gain traction in such a mature market. 

The Voicekey mTrust trusted mtrader scheme aims to address both vendor and user reluctance to mcommerce deployments as well as addressing all user accessibility issues. The hardware cost associated with our solution is very low, consisting of existing or low cost mobile retail point of sale units and consumer mobile phones. To initiate a transaction, consumers need only to activate an APP on their phone. For security purposes this APP will only activate when in the vicinity of one of the trusted mtrader units. Once activated, mutual authentication is provided by the APP being qualified to the vendor system using an identity certificate previously created from the users? voice samples during a simple registration process. This certificate is displayed to the vendor as an on-screen digital code within the APP. The vendor can thus authenticate the user using conventional bar-code point-of-sale devices. To complete the transaction, a dynamic payment certificate is wirelessly sent to the phone where it can be displayed and scanned in order to debit the cost of the transaction from the users? bank account or phone balance. A derivative of the Voicekey mTrust product can also be used to ensure remote (i.e. online) trusted transactions processing. This will make use of secure out of band verification; developed under a previous TSB smart award.

As part of the mTrust system, a carer management and user fraud prevention training aid is provided that will enable children, vulnerable and disabled users to participate in the scheme with confidence. The aid addresses financial management and fraud prevention issues such as: Security, Consequences, Limits, Permissions etc. Voicekey is working with a range of hardware suppliers to tier 1 and high street retailers. These will provide the company with access to national and global routes to market. Our collaborations with inclusive user Charities and University accessibility research groups will also ensure that the developed solution will be both trusted and accessible for all.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>98983</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">972183</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
