 - Value to artists (including emerging artists, existing and up-market artists, art college students, artists of future generations)
 - Value to consumers as buyers or gallery visitors 
 - Value to the platform provider, including the gallery, curators, programmers
 - Value to the community and other stakeholder groups 

Previously, the visual arts have largely been investigated from instrumental rather than intrinsic perspectives and our proposed research will adopt both qualitative and quantitative approaches so that both tangible and intangible dimensions can be acknowledged and understood more clearly. By undertaking a case study, we investigate several dimensions of value created by the RSA New Contemporaries Exhibition as a Platform for Emerging Artists. The RSA mission is to promote and support the creation, understanding and enjoyment of the visual arts through all-year programme of exhibitions and events. The Exhibition has particular importance as a way for newly graduating art students to commence a career in the visual arts. Each individual artist places a certain value on their work. This value can be viewed in both financial and non-financial terms. In addition, the visitors to, and the organisers of the exhibition will also have certain views on the value of the art work being exhibited as well as the exhibition itself. Our research aims to understand how this value is both shaped and understood by those involving parties of the exhibition. This cultural value, as well as economic value, is also of importance to art investors, as well as the RSA in terms of contributing towards its reputation. 

With a particular intention to enhance and enrich the existing cultural valuation methods applied by policy makers and economists, we will use a variety of techniques to identify and measure the cultural value associated with the RSA New Contemporaries exhibition. First of all, we apply a non-economic perspective in placing the experience of the individual at the centre of our evaluation. We will examine how emerging artists set their initial benchmarking price, given that there is no historical value of their own work as a reference point and how important this particular exhibition and role of cultural institutions are for them. A series of focus groups will be undertaken to gain insights from value creators and recipients. In-depth interviews will be mostly undertaken with practitioners and professionals. The gatekeepers are representative of a particular social sector, and their valuation approach will add further insights. Secondly, to evaluate how individuals perceive cultural value, we employ a behavioural economics approach, taking account of psychological effects. Based on the propositions of Prospect Theory Kahneman and Tversky, we will apply a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to a Contingent Valuation (CV) approach based on willingness-to-pay model. We will use the survey with gallery visitors and broader stakeholder groups to see whether the stated preference from individuals varies depending on the manner in which the questions are presented. Thirdly, the interpretation of our findings will adopt holistic approaches from compatibility and interdisciplinary viewpoints including auditors, investors, marketers and psychologists. In addition, we will use a number of accounting measurement methods to ensure that the process of data analysis is rigorous. We envisage that the findings from our research will influence other supporting organisations throughout the United Kingdom to adopt a similar approach to assisting career development. We believe that our findings can help Government and other public bodies to better understand how the arts in general are central to cultural value creation, with creativity and innovation being important drivers of successful practice.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>First, the research will directly benefit the Royal Scottish Academy (RSA) itself. As the letter of support written by the President of the RSA makes clear, the research will benefit the RSA in terms of a formal analysis of the effectiveness of the RSA New Contemporaries Exhibitions run by the RSA. This is important as these Exhibitions have the highest profile, and are arguably the most important of the various schemes of assistance run by the RSA in order to meet its mission of promoting and supporting the visual arts generally and emerging artists in particular. A value analysis will therefore be of great benefit to the Academy in evaluating the success of the exhibition as means of supporting emerging artists. Additionally the research will enable the RSA to enjoy a higher profile with potential sponsors and funding bodies

Second, the identified findings from the RSA case in terms of effective support for the arts, and for emerging artists in particular, can be applied to comparable institutions both within the UK, e.g. to projects such as the comparable Bloomberg New Contemporaries exhibitions, and internationally. In many nations, most especially in the third world, there may be little government support for the arts. The lessons learnt from this project may be of benefit in highlighting the role of cultural institutions as cultural leaders in settings where there is little or no central funding support for the arts. 

Third, the research will impact beneficially on the exhibiting artists themselves. Each year, Scotland produces over a thousand art college graduates, many of who aspire to become self-employed practitioners. Even experienced artists, however, find pricing their work to be a challenging task. The project will contribute to the pricing strategies of artists by enhancing their understanding of the value of their own work. An important means for doing this will be to compare prices set at the exhibition with value as determined by both a hedonic pricing model and by the qualitative perceptions of both purchasers and non-purchasing consumers visiting the exhibition. Perceptions of past exhibitors at previous exhibitions will also be investigated and these will be especially valuable in identifying the career enhancing value of the exhibition to present and future emerging artists.

Fourth, the investigation of perceptions of, and differing approaches to value with both purchasers and non-purchasing consumers will enable these groups to explore their own conceptions of value. This will both enhance the cultural enjoyment and understanding of these groups and enable exploration of how their identifiers of value accord or conflict with financial or market measures of value. 

Fifth, the research will benefit investors, specifically by enhancing the transparency of the market for emerging Scottish artists and thus strengthening investor confidence in art as an alternative investment. 

Sixthly, increased confidence in art as an investment can result in indirect financial effects to the benefit of the artistic community. More generally, by highlighting the need for more opportunities to access art, the research will help stimulate ways of accessing communal cultural enrichment. 

A key mechanism for operationalising the impact of the research is the one day workshop to be held for artists, academics, supporting bodies, consumers and other interested stakeholders on the conclusion of the research.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>38556</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Feedback workshop (University of Stirling</gtr:description><gtr:id>B322AF71-D2C0-444D-AECC-7226B01BCC2F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54579ad53ad334.73871316</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>presentations for Feedback workshop</gtr:description><gtr:id>90A78340-72B2-495B-B94D-D8C6A1AE7AD3</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546099298878c5.56891152</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We are continuing to uncover additional dimensions of cultural value which move beyond the economic and the instrumental.
