The food business is one that provides huge potential for demonstration of return on investment for RFID. The technology has been proven to provide a return: 
- By providing authentication of the origin of foodstuffs, thereby increasing consumer confidence and allowing access to premium markets;
- By reducing wastage and optimising logistics costs;
- By increasing quality of goods to the consumer.
However, it is hard for SMEs to realise this return. Unlike major producers and retailers, they do not have control over the whole business process, and therefore cannot deploy the technology, along with the ancillary data systems, to allow the RoI to be realised.
The project will federate internationally producers, processors, logistics, retailers and consumers around a data system which will deploy standardised solutions to allow the traceability and authentication of foodstuffs from a multiplicity of producers. By membership of such a system, SMEs in the food sector will be able to make a return on investment. 
The solution adopted here is to include within the consortium six partners (including the technology transfer organisations of four Universities) whose major role is technological support for SMEs.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_PROJECTED</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>99200</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The project has agreed to continue its activities through a new, not-for profit organisation, the 'Farm to Fork Foundation. The aims of the foundation are:
i) To continue to build the standards and methodology developed by the project as the basis for a Europe Wide food information system.
ii) To be the legal owner of the F2F standards and the infrastructure (database system)
iii) To engage and promote continued research on the F2F system.
iv) To promote widespread adoption of the system.
v) To provide a framework for trust and accreditation, which the system needs to maintain credibility as a source of trusted information.
vi) To maintain links with other standards and information bodies, such as EuroFIR, GS-1, RFID in Europe, etc.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>F87A7A60-4910-4D91-8AE3-41F0CFDEA6DF</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54623a2b052269.66841093</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project has met all of its major objectives. As a result, we have successfully demonstrated and evaluated 22 pilot installations, covering all stages of the value chain and the four different food sectors laid down in the original proposal. The potential for return on investment has been demonstrated quantitatively in some pilots and qualitatively in others. The system has been demonstrated and displayed at many major conferences and exhibitions and received a universally positive response. As a result, the present consortiums are in discussion with a number of companies about full commercial implementations of the system. However the system depends on accessibility and generality for success, which means that continued activity to promote the concept and the specifications on which it is based is necessary. Going forward, this will be the role of the Farm to Fork foundation.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Accelerating the take-up of RFID technologies between European SMEs and paving the way for an environment in which concepts and ideas for a future Internet of Things can be developed.
Providing a set of indicators that allow the analysis of the driving forces affecting RFID adoption in SMEs, e.g. Competition (cost reduction and competitive advantages), Legislation &amp;amp; Regulation (e.g. traceability, e-pedigree), Consumer Mandates (e.g. In retail and logistics), and many others.
Fostering demand in RFID technologies among SMEs opening wider markets for suppliers of innovative RFID-based solutions many of which are innovative SMEs.
Return on investment for participating SMEs, by inclusion in a system which allows them to optimize their part of the value chain in line with the requirements of the whole chain
Increased consumer confidence, since it will be possible to gain precise information on the origin and condition of foodstuffs
Reduced wastage and carbon usage, by allowing optimization of transport and storage conditions on the basis of monitoring of the whole value chain
Opening up of new markets, by means of the ability to demonstrate the quality and freshness of the product</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>DD4B9486-1686-4F81-A7AE-BFAB932FE394</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54623c15bb5197.96414302</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.rfid-f2f.eu/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BBS/E/F/00042587</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
