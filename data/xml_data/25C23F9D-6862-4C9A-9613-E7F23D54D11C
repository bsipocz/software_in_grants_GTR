If the DNA to be duplicated is damaged, and this is left unrepaired, this will hinder genome replication by slowing/stalling the DNA replication machinery. Ultimately, such damage leads to genomic rearrangements that can be passed on to daughter cells, or may even result in cell death. The gradual accumulation of genetic damage over time is a fundamental factor in the transformation of healthy cells into tumour cells. Therefore, it is clear that repair of DNA damage occurring during DNA replication helps to maintain human health and prevent diseases such as cancer.

To counter the effects of genetic damage during DNA replication, cells have evolved complex networks of proteins which allow the recognition and repair of damaged DNA. These proteins are regulated by an intricate series of modifications, which function to regulate their abilities to appropriately detect/repair damaged DNA. Addition or removal of these modifications is achieved by catalytic proteins known as enzymes. One such modification is methylation, which modifies the structure of several proteins, and is carried out by a specific set of enzymes. 

In this context, I have identified that one such methylation enzyme (called SET1A) functions to help repair damaged DNA that arises during replication. When SET1A is lost, cells are unable to properly repair such DNA damage, and these cells accumulate high levels of DNA alterations. SET1A also interacts with a protein called BLM, which functions during DNA replication and is mutated in a rare human disease (Bloom's syndrome). Early experiments suggest that SET1A methylates BLM, which may explain why loss of SET1A renders cells unable to properly repair DNA damage occurring during DNA replication. 

Inherited mutations in many components involved in DNA repair during replication also predispose individuals to a greater risk of developing blood disorders, ultimately leading to leukaemia. I have also shown that SET1A binds to, and acts alongside, a DNA damage protein called BOD1L. Interestingly, loss of this methylation complex (BOD1L and/or SET1A) may also be linked to the development of similar blood disorders. Together with my other data, this suggests that SET1A is crucial for controlling the response to DNA damage and preventing human disease, perhaps including leukaemia.

Whilst we know that DNA repair during replication is important to maintain the cellular genome, it is unknown how protein methylation is involved in this response, or whether problems with methylation contribute to human disease. This proposal aims to investigate these further, using three complementary approaches. Firstly, I aim to establish how BLM methylation helps to promote DNA repair, and to identify other DNA repair proteins that are methylated by SET1A. Secondly, I aim to ascertain how cancer-associated mutations affect the ability of BOD1L to bind to SET1A, and whether this affects their function. Thirdly, using a mouse model, I aim to determine whether loss of one copy of SET1A affects how cells repair DNA, and whether these mice develop blood disorders.

The proposed scheme of research will further our understanding of this fundamental aspect of the DNA damage response. It has the potential to make a significant impact on improving human health and wellbeing in the long term, and will lay the groundwork for future pharmacological treatments for use in treating cancers.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Genome instability underlies cellular transformation, and thus is a frequent hallmark of cancers. One major causative factor is replication stress (RS), which is observed in premalignant cells, where it acts as a significant driver of genome instability. Numerous cellular proteins function to combat RS, acting to maintain genomic integrity. However, the regulation of these factors, particularly the impact of post-translational modifications, is poorly studied.

My preliminary data demonstrates that a lysine methyltransferase, SET1A, is crucial for dealing with RS. In its absence, cells are exquisitely sensitive to agents that induce RS, and exhibit catastrophic genome instability. Further analyses demonstrate that SET1A and its binding partner BOD1L regulate the BLM helicase, and suggest that BLM is methylated in a SET1A-dependent fashion. Moreover, initial investigations suggest that deregulation of this Lys methyltransferase complex is involved in haematopoietic malignancies. Taken together, these data suggest that SET1A-mediated methylation of DNA damage response (DDR) proteins regulates the RS response and acts to maintain genome stability and prevent cellular transformation. This proposal therefore has three objectives: to investigate the role of Lys methylation of non-histone DDR proteins in the RS response, to assess the importance of the SET1A-BOD1L interaction in maintaining genome stability, and to analyse the impact of SET1A haploinsufficiency on replication stress and haematopoiesis.

The data generated will further our fundamental understanding of the cellular response to RS, which is vital to fully comprehend the basis of cellular transformation. It will provide fundamental insights into the role of Lys methylation in maintaining genome stability, and the impact of unresolved RS on haematopoietic malignancies. Finally, it may lay the groundwork for the future development and use of pharmacological SET1A inhibitors as potential anti-cancer therapies</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>This proposal aims to improve our understanding of how cells respond to replication stress and how protein methylation mediated by the SET1A Lys methyltransferase complex is involved in this process. It is known that dysregulation of other Lys methyltransferases is associated both with inherited disease and cancer. The experiments described in this project focuses on investigating how SET1A-mediated Lys methylation helps to safeguard genome stability and prevent disease.
Beyond academic research, the results arising from this study, together with the preliminary data already generated, have to potential to have a significant impact on the health sector. This will be achieved via close collaboration with clinicians and researchers expert in the fields of replication stress and haematopoeisis, together with academic and commercial entities:
Firstly, my preliminary data, obtained in collaboration with Prof. Tatjana Stankovic (University of Birmingham) and Dr. M. Raghavan (QE Hospital, Birmingham Haematology Dept), demonstrate that a component of the SET1A Lys methyltransferase complex, BOD1L, is mutated in a high proportion of cases of Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS), a condition intimately linked with the development of leukaemias, particularly acute myeloid leukaemia. Since inherited deficiencies in many proteins that protect against replication stress predispose individuals to a greater risk of MDS, it is conceivable that both BOD1L and SET1A are also involved in preventing MDS through their roles in the response to replication stress. As a consequence, the modelling of BOD1L gene mutations in MDS/CLL described in objective 2 of my proposal may provide novel insight into both prognosis and treatment of MDS and CLL, thus impacting directly on human health.
In addition, several lines of evidence suggest that, as is the case with other Lys methyltransferases, haploinsufficiency of SET1A may impact replication stress and underlie inherited disease and haematopoietic defects. Modelling the impact of Set1a haploinsufficiency in vitro and in vivo may assist our understanding of the basis of similar haematopoietic defects. Moreover, loss of SET1A function in patients may lead to symptoms consistent with Kabuki Syndrome and Weidemann-Steiner syndromes. My research may therefore aid our ability to diagnose SET1A mutations as the underlying cause of similar, uncharacterised syndromes, therefore benefitting both clinicians and patients, assisting in clinical management, and improving quality of life.
Finally, my preliminary data demonstrates that deficiencies in the SET1A/BOD1L complex sensitise cells to exogenous replication stress. This therefore may potentiate the development of small-molecule inhibitors of SET1A activity, with the ultimate aim of using such compounds to sensitise tumour cells to replication stress and induce cell death. In analogous fashion, inhibitors of PARP activity have successfully been used to treat homologous recombination-deficient tumours. This has paved the way for other novel anti-cancer agents that work on the principle of synthetic lethality. Furthermore, inhibitors of other epigenetic components are currently showing great promise in pre-clinical and in vivo trials. Together, this therefore supports a targeted collaboration with commercial pharmaceutical stakeholders to develop SET1A inhibitors, with the ultimate aim of developing novel therapeutic anti-cancer strategies. Indeed, I have also initiated collaborations with individuals at the Drug Discovery Unit, University of Manchester to instigate such a process. 
Taken together, it is clear that my proposed work could have a significant long term impact on human health and wellbeing through interaction with several potential beneficiaries in the public and private sectors.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2022-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1326850</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/P009085/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>7C58A707-1BF6-4573-A44F-30B271C80813</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cancer</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
