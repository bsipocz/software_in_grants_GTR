Aside from its small size and affordable maintenance, Drosophila offers a wide variety of behaviors and the most highly developed genetic tools. The brain contains 100,000 neurons, large enough to produce interesting behaviors but small enough to experimentally manageable and over the last ten years recombinant DNA tools have transformed its study. One of these tools is engineered genes that act as switches in a subset of neurons within the nervous system. These genes allow scientists to manipulate brain circuits by switching on effector molecules, for example a toxin to silence a neural subset. As the rest of the brain remains unaffected, a change in behavior can be assigned to only those 'switched on' neurons. Unfortunately however the DNA that controls a switch is often poorly suited to the question an experimenter wishes to ask. The switch might be active either too broadly or in a limited range, and recent work has attempted several ways to refine this. Several methods use two DNA sequences to control two interacting switches. These switches turn on the effector molecule in a more limited distribution of neurons. However, the existing tools are limited for several reasons. One tool relies on cell division to be effective and so only works when the control DNA is active during development. This renders it useless for the large class of molecules that become active in the early adult stage. Another tool requires entirely new switch transgenes and thus can not draw on the thousands of existing transgenic fly lines that have already been established. This project proposes developing a new composite switch system that can be used in conjunction with existing fly lines, to limit and refine their expression pattern. It proposes drawing on an existing method for modifying a switch protein to bind to a new DNA target, introducing the new switch into transgenic flies and using it to study a novel class of olfactory neuron. Using a behavioral assay, it will assess whether these neurons act as amplifiers to weak odors, or more generally to boost all odor signals the fly receives.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The study of neural function in the fly relies on transgenes that drive expression in neural sets. Drivers can be used to express a variety of effector transgenes, including anatomical markers or effectors of neural function. In these binary systems, driver transgenes are constructed by fusing a transcriptional activator - usually the yeast factor GAL4 - to the untranscribed control regions of a gene. Responder genes are under the control of upstream activation sites (UASGAL) that mediate activation by the driver GAL4. However, gene control regions often express too broadly to precisely dissect neural function. One approach to address this problem uses two interacting driver lines that limit expression to the intersection of two patterns, but current systems have limitations. We will develop a derivative of GAL4 that has a novel DNA binding affinity. In vitro experiments show that GAL4's DNA-binding zinc finger can be replaced with other zinc fingers. We will express this protein, combined with the correspondingly modified UASZ variant. Because the dimerization domain is preserved, heterodimers of GAL4 and the variant protein will bind a hybrid UASZG with non-palindromic half-sites. The heterodimer requirement of this hybrid site permits using the two proteins as AND operators. This will allow us to drive expression of effector molecules at the intersect of two expression patterns, providing greater precision of genetic control over physiology. This method improves upon existing methods as it will allow the use of existing GAL4 enhancer trap lines, a significant established resource in fly genetics. This ternary expression system will be used to study cholinergic local neurons in the antennal lobe, which previously have been inaccessible to specific manipulations. It will be used to acutely inactivate these neurons in behaving animals during odor responses to better understand a possible signal amplifier role of these cells.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>121463</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/G024146/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
