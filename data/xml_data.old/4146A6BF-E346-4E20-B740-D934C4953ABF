These produce results of great value to both the research and policy-making communities, and provide high quality, individual-level surveys for secondary analyses. In fact, the SES series provides us with our most important source of information on changes in the work experiences of British workers over time. These changes include: the skills of jobs require; the way work is organised; opportunities for skill and career development; and perceptions of different types of insecurity. The series has also been our best source of evidence of long-term trends in work motivation, organisational commitment, job satisfaction and work stress. It has put Britain in the leading group of European countries in terms of the quality of data on these issues along with Sweden, Finland, France and Germany. These countries are continuing to invest in data collection exercises similar to SES. Other countries such as Singapore, New Zealand and the Netherlands are also starting to invest in this area, often drawing heavily on the content and methods of data collection pioneered by SES. This project will help to maintain Britain's leading position in the field as well as trace the connections the quality of work has with employee-driven innovation and productivity enhancement initiatives.

The survey will aim to collect data on all the main features of job quality by interviewing a stratified random sample of workers aged 20-65 in Britain. These interviews will be carried out in 2017 on a face-to-face in people's home and will last around 60 minutes. The issues covered will include, inter alia: the skills of the job; working time; work effort; promotion prospects; job security; the ability to use initiative; the physical risks and demands of the job; relationships with superiors and others; satisfaction; and pay. At the launch of each data collection round, we have made judicious reductions of previous questionnaire batteries in order to make interview space for 'new' questions designed to address issues of particular academic and policy relevance. In the 2017, new survey questions will be used in order to shed light on: how the productivity of workers and the capacity for greater workplace innovation might be enhanced; the extent to which organisational justice can reduce anxiety and boost worker participation in decision-making; and what factors prompt older workers to continue in or retire from their current jobs, hence revealing what needs to be done to keep them in work longer.

In specific terms, the project will:

i. Chart the level and distribution of, and changes to, some of the key drivers of productivity such as work organisation, job-related well-being, the skills requirements of jobs, and the incidence, volume and quality of training and learning.

ii. Describe and analyse the level and distribution of key aspects of job quality in 2017 - such as employee involvement, work intensity, insecurity and well-being at work - and make comparisons with earlier data points in the series.

iii. Use the data to develop distinctive, original and substantive contributions to scholarship surrounding job quality and job skill, and the connections these aspects of work have with productivity and innovation. 

iv. Make the data available and provide the necessary documentary material to allow further analyses by academic and policy-based researchers in the field of skills and job quality.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The Skills and Employment Survey series is a crucial part of social science research infrastructure. Funding the 2017 survey will allow enable this to continue. Its value to the academic community is evidenced by: (1) the number of researchers who have downloaded the data for secondary analysis - nearly 1,200 downloads have been recorded and the series has 760 registered users, 231 of whom have used the 2012 survey (figures supplied by the UK Data Service, June 2016); and (2) the number of published outputs known to have been produced - the count for the last four surveys currently stands at 148. In addition, the series has pioneered new ways of collecting survey data on skills, learning and the quality of work. These tools have been copied internationally - in Singapore, the Netherlands and New Zealand - and have formed the basis for a module in the OECD's 2012 Survey of Adult Skills. The new instruments incorporated into the 2017 survey on productivity and employee-driven innovation, organisational justice and the employment decisions of older workers may have similar international appeal.

We anticipate that the findings of the 2017 survey will also shape the policy debate. Previous research findings from the series have shed new light on the use of skills in British workplaces, the changing quality of work in Britain, and role played by employee engagement in making working life better and laying the foundations for improvements in performance. The results have been used by a number of organisations such as the UKCES, the pay review bodies, HESA, the devolved administrations, the political parties, the Smith Institute and the Skills Commission. In addition, there are 63 registered users of the data who work for central and local government, non-governmental organisations or not-for-profit entities.

The policy relevance and impact of the data series can only increase as the series is extended. In keeping with the policy-relevant nature of the proposal, we will maximise the impact of the research by targeting a range of outlets and venues to publicise the findings of the survey. This will ensure that the project meets the ESRC's goal of excellence with impact and expand on the already large community of 760 registered users of the data series (see Pathways to Impact section).

The project's outputs will include: a fully documented dataset; a series of first findings reports similar to those for SES2012, tracking trends in skills, job quality and well-being; at least three working papers (subsequently leading to refereed journal articles); summaries of the survey findings in practitioner outlets; and at least two launch events (there may be others depending on boost financing). Funding SES2017 will also provide continuity with and build on previous surveys in the series, provide a valuable and unique addition to the social science data resource infrastructure, and set a benchmark against which future surveys can compare.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>996661</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/P005292/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DC53A3F2-81B6-40C9-874D-291D23B3C79F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>231B8162-9E4D-46FB-BB69-0A4B66598C2B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Employment Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>46FB536B-9B51-49F1-B2DF-5A14789705F2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Resource Management</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9BE2E53E-4358-4EDC-9E31-723C873EE26A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Labour economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D2DE952A-D3A4-42AA-B3D0-37E979EBA723</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology of Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
