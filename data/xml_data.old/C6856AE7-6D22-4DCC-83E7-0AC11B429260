Catalysts are not consumed by chemical reactions, but act by reducing the energy required for a reaction to proceed, thus reducing the reaction temperature, whilst at the same time increasing the selectivity of the reaction. In many cases chemical reactions are not possible without a catalyst. Catalysts are therefore an essential component of green chemical processes, increasing the efficiency of reactions and enabling new substances to be prepared. Catalysts are ubiquitous in commercial chemical production; with some 80% of feedstock chemicals produced using a catalyst. Many of the catalysts are based upon expensive rare metals, the use of which presents a number of problems. By virtue of their rarity, at the current rate of consumption many of these metals will become uneconomical to mine by the end of this century. In the short term, the mining and recycling costs associated with using these metals are significant, and can be prohibitive. This proposal aims to develop the emerging area of asymmetric catalysis using the inexpensive and environmentally benign Group 2 metals, particularly calcium, as a potential solution to this problem.Group 2 metals have shown much recent promise, with applications in catalysis showing their potential in this area. The Group 2 metals are therefore poised to make a significant contribution to Green Catalysis , as chemists seek to develop new and emerging technologies to render existing chemical processes cleaner whilst reducing costs. One of the main limitations associated with Group 2 metals is the stability of well-defined molecular species in solution; this has the tendency of rendering complexes either inactive or non-selective in catalysis. There have been important recent developments with non-stereoselective systems regarding the preparation of stable complexes. Our main objective is therefore to advance the catalytic applications of Group 2 metals beyond their current level, and into the arena of asymmetric catalysis.To this end, a series of chiral supporting ligands will be developed which are designed to increase the stability of Group 2 metal complexes. The complexes thus formed will enable the stereodirecting properties to be controlled as well independently controlling the ligand binding strength, such that an optimum binding strength can be found without compromising on catalytic activity. The coordination chemistry and reactivity of Group 2 complexes will be studies in order to assess their stability, and their reactivity towards unsaturated substrates which are pertinent to catalytic reactions.The catalytic applications described in this proposal will concentrate on the asymmetric hydroamination reaction, a 100% atom efficient synthetic route to a plethora of organic products and intermediates. Should the catalysts enable stereocontrol over the reaction products, this will open the door for further developments in asymmetric catalysis using Group 2 metals, moving a step closer to cleaner and inexpensive catalytic processes.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100899</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Finding substitutes for precious metals</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B39D8EBF-45D9-4781-9034-08F49401DD7D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The research supported by this grant was selected for inclusion in a leading national report, commissioned by Universities UK, entitled Big Ideas for the Future (June 2011).

At the time of the grant award, the benchmark was 6% enantiomeric excess, however we have developed catalysts systems that give 26% enantiomeric excess, which is sufficiently high to prove the viability of calcium in this research arena.



The research involved the development of a series of chiral diamines, which when coordinated to calcium gave excellent catalysts for the hydroamination of amino-alkenes, with superior selectivities to those reported previously for calcium.



These diamines were further employed in the synthesis of chiral bisimidazoline ligands. When coordinated to calcium, these did not give quite as high selectivities, however subtle variations in the ligand structure had a profound influence on the ligand redistribution processes that plague calcium coordination chemistry. 



All of the above findings have fed into the international research effort and are influencing the future directions in this area of research, as evidenced by article citations.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>the use of calcium catalysts in industrial contexts has the potential to curb the use of expensive and toxic precious metals, thus reducing the chemical industries' environmental footprint as well as contributing to economic growth. Primarily, the research has been put to use by influencing the future directions of this research, for example, our further research beyond this grant award has established another record of 50% enantiomeric excess, by building on the knowledge acquired during this award.



As the selectivity increases towards the &amp;gt;95% mark, there are increasing prospects for industries to embark on utilising calcium in industrial catalytic processes, thus reducing their reliance on expensive precious metals.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C84AA79D-BA21-4B13-9383-25A49DBA0D0F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-6710438268.920815774e932a</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Education,Environment,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2D7C9DB2-A583-4C8E-81FE-3F9F714F1AC7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Chiral calcium catalysts for asymmetric hydroamination/cyclisation.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Chemical communications (Cambridge, England)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/05b5e9e08856d1afa2361ca892a393c4"><gtr:id>05b5e9e08856d1afa2361ca892a393c4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wixey JS</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1359-7345</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d02d02dc282185</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>10388F31-FD48-4A52-89F5-0328FF6F2C87</gtr:id><gtr:title>Modular ligand variation in calcium bisimidazoline complexes: effects on ligand redistribution and hydroamination catalysis.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/05b5e9e08856d1afa2361ca892a393c4"><gtr:id>05b5e9e08856d1afa2361ca892a393c4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wixey JS</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1477-9226</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d02e02e24f034c</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/H012109/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64596636-AE88-4F6E-A816-9C4C203E1197</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Catalysis &amp; surfaces</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>35E9CECD-F211-4914-9F91-4B8FB76B773D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Catalysis &amp; Applied Catalysis</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
