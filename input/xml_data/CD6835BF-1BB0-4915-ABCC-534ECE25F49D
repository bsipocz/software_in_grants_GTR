Much of the literature dealing with this notorious figure follows the lead of Randy Shilts, a San Francisco journalist. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>Shilts's influential popular history, &lt;em>And the Band Played On&lt;/em>, publicly identified the flight attendant in question as Ga&amp;eacute;tan Dugas, and portrayed him as a cold-blooded, recalcitrant disease disseminator. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>The rich historical record, however, offers the possibility of a more nuanced understanding of the man and his alleged role in the early North American epidemic. Medical authorities have long dismissed suggestions that Dugas was the original case of AIDS in North America, responsible for the introduction of the disease. Yet the &amp;quot;Patient Zero&amp;quot; story caught the public imagination and spread far beyond its original American epidemiologic setting, living on in media discussions, legal discourse, and popular speech. Richard McKay's research draws on archival material and oral history interviews to understand these legacies, offering insight into how societies respond to the threat of deadly epidemics. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-01-03</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-01-04</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>79929</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>King's College London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Queer @ King's</gtr:department><gtr:description>AIDS @ 30 : three decades of responding to HIV/AIDS</gtr:description><gtr:id>249BDE5C-CE9F-445C-B9D7-51F19A912DFC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>There was a sequel to the lecture series, in which leftover funding went to support an open day for the Leicestershire AIDS Support Services in July 2013.

Drawing on my research, I wrote the historical discussion for the letter's online supplement, and was also one of three among the ten credited contributors to co-write the main letter. Within two days of the online publication of our interdisciplinary letter in Nature on 26 October 2016, our research garnered nearly 1,000 news stories globally. Included below is a summary of the main articles gathered by Nature's press monitoring service after fewer than 48 hours of online publication. This was a tremendously impactful story, and more than one outlet later incorporated the study into its year-end round-ups (for example, CTV News in Canada included the study as #3 of '7 major medical breakthroughs of 2016' [http://www.ctvnews.ca/health/7-major-medical-breakthroughs-of-2016-1.3201264].

The New York Times carried a story about the study as a front-page article on 27 October 2016, and indicated that the scientific research was 'bolstered by some intriguing historical detective work'. In the online version of this article [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/27/health/hiv-patient-zero-genetic-analysis.html?_r=0], this phrase links directly to my 2014 article in the Bulletin of the History of Medicine. The Sydney Morning Herald carried more than one article about the study, including a piece that articulated, with its title, a view of history that many historians would wish was more widely shared among the general public: 'The end of AIDS' Patient Zero myth shows that history is never complete' [http://www.smh.com.au/comment/the-end-of-aids-patient-zero-myth-shows-that-history-is-never-complete-20161031-gsehhp.html]. In other words, my research findings contributed to a study that helped stimulate debate around the world about the histories of science, medicine, and public health, and about how our historical understanding of the past is constantly in flux.

Perhaps the most striking use of my research findings was in the editorial in Nature, which coincided with the study's online publication date ['Rewriting history: A genetic analysis of HIV clears the man wrongly dubbed the source of the epidemic', Nature 538 (2016), 428]. The editorial opened and closed with direct quotes from the letter written by Ga&amp;eacute;tan Dugas that I had uncovered in my research. It took years for me to build sufficient trust - with Ray Redford, Ga&amp;eacute;tan Dugas's friend and former lover (and the owner of the physical document) and with Dugas's surviving family members - to gain permission to publish excerpts from this letter in my 2014 article in the Bulletin of the History of Medicine. My research, which was encapsulated in the 2014 article, provided the Nature editors with the specific historical evidence and the moral language they needed to explain the importance of the 2016 interdisciplinary study.

First, my thesis demonstrates that the CDC's early modification of the term, from 'patient 57' to 'patient O' to 'patient 0', unwittingly misled other epidemiologists and members of the media, and later the public, into thinking this case might be the source of the outbreak. 

Second, my work establishes a biographical frame for Randy Shilts that permits a far greater understanding of the history book he wrote, one which has been described as among the most influential books of the late twentieth century. Shilts set out to write a popular history of the epidemic, replete with heroes and villains, and intended to cast the virus itself as a villainous character. In the course of his research he discovered the identity of the man whom the CDC had labelled as 'patient 0'. I demonstrate that when Shilts overlaid his professionally motivated reconstruction of Dugas's life upon the original virus character, this deliberate combination of deadly virus with alleged intentional transmission made a powerful impression on the popular consciousness. This was particularly true since the 'Patient Zero' story was disseminated as a news story to promote the release of the book, and was eagerly taken up by a sensation-seeking media.

Third, I demonstrate that Ga&amp;eacute;tan Dugas's role as a 'sociopath' circulated widely in the North American media. More importantly, stories about Dugas entered legal journals as part of an emerging discourse about criminalising HIV transmission, at a time when several states in the U.S. were contemplating legislation to respond to the perceived threat of a generalised epidemic. 

Finally, by adopting an approach influenced by the literature that gives weight to the patient's perspective, I argue that Dugas's alleged 'sociopathic' behaviour can be more fruitfully discussed in terms of the decisions made by a sceptical patient who was attempting to fit often intrusive and contradictory medical advice into his own bodily experience of disease.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Policymakers making decisions in the ongoing debate surrounding the criminalisation of HIV transmission will benefit from a historical analysis of the development of the debate itself. In particular, they will be interested in learning how the development of the idea of the dangerous sexual psychopath, a figure whose spectre led to demands for HIV-specific laws to protect the public, can be linked to Shilts's dramatic representation of Dugas in the media. Some authors have called for more research to understand this process and how the media's conflation of HIV and criminality can affect public perception and stigma. My work will also benefit policymakers working in the fields of community health who are interested in issues of patient non-compliance and risk reduction. 

Journalists use individuals as a way of simplifying and illustrating elaborate stories for their readers. This reductionism is often present in discussions of epidemic origins. The media focus on a young Mexican boy as the 'Patient Zero' of the H1N1 outbreak strongly suggests that a template for reporting on emerging epidemics now exists, a key part of which is to locate 'the first patient'. Such reporting risks not only a significant oversimplification of the structural factors that influence an epidemic but also the suggestion to the public that a public health response can be reduced to eliminating the threat posed by the earliest case. I intend to engage with the above groups by writing a paper for the History and Policy website (www.historyandpolicy.org) within the next 12 months.

People living with HIV and AIDS (PHAs) have often had to deal with self stigma and enacted stigma as a result of their diagnosis, and have had to cope with negative media representations of individuals transmitting the virus. My research not only demonstrates the difficulties encountered by an early person living with AIDS, but also how he coped with such problems and made sense of his diagnosis. I will continue to engage with PHAs by delivering public lectures in joint partnership with the gay archives and AIDS organisations based in the cities where I conducted my research.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>89CB0DD1-E179-40BF-86A1-745FAFAB0817</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-1128083962.1350951b2f317b0</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D3A5363E-EC8B-46E7-BEA2-484146641322</gtr:id><gtr:title>1970s and 'Patient 0' HIV-1 genomes illuminate early HIV/AIDS history in North America.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nature</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f916b11a14ab96073791b0983fd78c93"><gtr:id>f916b11a14ab96073791b0983fd78c93</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Worobey M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0028-0836</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>581c84986ef843.81241456</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1C2D9F72-8A7E-44D1-A446-5CA4DA75B035</gtr:id><gtr:title>Patient Zero and the Making of the AIDS Epidemic</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2215d7787f00595743997f8de8a48b7e"><gtr:id>2215d7787f00595743997f8de8a48b7e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>McKay Richard A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781681689944</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>5aa6a0901832f0.40996097</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>FDF65EA0-0E23-4CDC-8363-9943A650175D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Jennifer Brier, Infectious Ideas: U.S. Political Responses to the AIDS Crisis</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Social History of Medicine</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e52eaa4c5bf1e605ff67ee356bc7f76c"><gtr:id>e52eaa4c5bf1e605ff67ee356bc7f76c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>McKay R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>r_9864579546cad54cda</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8CAADB88-A8F3-4C2C-AE1D-3B21BCA04D4F</gtr:id><gtr:title>A Medical History of Skin: Scratching the Surface</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6e812650b44235b9ac80edd02a66cc00"><gtr:id>6e812650b44235b9ac80edd02a66cc00</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>McKay, R.
