This will be done through extensive case study analysis from a transdisciplinary perspective, which encompasses key factors of urban food production and consumption systems. Resulting data will be elaborated through modelling of flows (of energy, water and other resources), with a methodology also based on urban metabolism.
Objectives of the project include: the development of an innovative and comprehensive system (FEW-meter) to measure UA from a FWE nexus perspective; the establishment of an on-line community of growers that will help gather data; the development of scenarios of optimal use of urban resources, based on an expansion of UA at city scale; and the generation of digital tools to support urban growers optimising the urban metabolism of their agricultural practices. The project thus contributes to the transformation of cities towards sustainability.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project aims at measuring the potential for urban agriculture to utilise urban resources in an urban metabolism perspective. The analysis developed during the project will allow the identification of best practices in urban agriculture, including innovative resource-efficient cropping methods, reduction in energy use, the utilisation of urban waste as nutrient, and responsible food production and consumption. Impact will be generated within the following audiences: 

- Communities of urban growers, including members of the Federation of City Farms and Community Gardens (FCFCG) - a project partner - as well as all the other growers which will be reached through dissemination activities; 
- NGOs and charities working in the sustainable food sector such as Sustain and Food Alliance, which will be contacted in the course of the project and updated on its progress; 
- Local authorities such as Portsmouth City Council, which already expressed interest in the project; 
- Practitioners working in the field of sustainable food planning and urban design, who will be reached through Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA).

Impact will consist in and be generated as follows: 

- Knowledge exchange between urban growers through the digital platform where data collected from case studies will be uploaded; new knowledge co-developed by urban growers and researchers on the optimisation of urban resources finalised to food production;
- Involvement of NGOs, which will be sought from the start of the project: representatives will be invited to participate in workshops, meetings and other dissemination events. Representatives will be also consulted as expert to ensure the relevance and novelty of the project. The network of contacts of FCFCG will be fundamental to reach and involve these NGOs;
- Sharing of findings and reports with local authorities, especially the final report presenting the simulation at a city-scale of the potential for urban agriculture to utilise urban resources. Portsmouth City Council has previously collaborated with Portsmouth School of Architecture and has already expressed interest in this project;
- The School of Architecture has developed a close relationship with RIBA and findings of the project will be shared with this institution and, through them, disseminated to UK architects via website and publications.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>163745</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/S002170/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E844174D-6A1C-4D2D-8F24-57698F7DA353</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environmental planning</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6BFE597D-D128-481A-A949-5847F619966F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environment</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E03855F0-1A26-4F21-8789-578E6A9BAC49</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Landscape  Architecture</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>19CA55B7-20B0-41C2-825B-06F2387EB8B9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Urban Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
