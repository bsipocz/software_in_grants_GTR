Yet, what is meant by 'collective worship'? What is its purpose? How should schools take account of the rights of children, parents and teachers when organising acts of collective worship? What are the legitimate interests of the state in such matters? Do significant differences exist in the way that collective worship is provided in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland? And to what extent is collective school worship capable of helping to develop shared values and cohesive and inclusive school communities in an increasingly plural and multi-cultural society? With the role of religion in public life an increasingly contentious matter for debate in the UK, these are some of the topical questions that this cross-disciplinary Research Network will seek to investigate.

The legal requirement for state schools to provide acts of collective worship, as well as the fact that the majority of such acts of collective worship during any school term must be of a 'wholly or mainly of a broadly Christian character', has long attracted controversy in the UK. However, perhaps surprisingly, relatively little has been published on this issue - a state of affairs which the Research Network aims to rectify.

The Network is composed of leading scholars from a range of disciplines including educationalists, lawyers, philosophers and sociologists, drawn from England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Taking an holistic approach, the Network will examine whether the current laws, policies and practices surrounding the provision of collective worship throughout the UK sufficiently exploit the potential of such acts to (i) enhance individual well-being (ii) foster a sense of a collective school identity, and (iii) create flourishing school communities.

A Steering Group will co-ordinate the activities of the Network. All members of the Network will attend two seminars (in Bangor and Glasgow), where each person will present papers on previously agreed areas relevant to collective worship. These research findings will then be made available to a wider audience at a public conference in Leicester, where a number of eminent figures in the fields of education, law, politics and sociology will speak. In accordance with a primary aim of the Research Network, which is to ensure the creation of meaningful partnerships between HE and non-HE stakeholders, the conference will be organised in such a way as to involve interested parties from beyond academia. These will include the representatives of the four Departments of Education in the UK, faith and secular groups, teaching and educational bodies, relevant governmental agencies, (eg., Standing Advisory Councils on Religious Education), NGOs and human rights organisations. 

The papers presented at the Network's seminars and conference will be published in an edited collection of essays. It is also planned that the inter-disciplinary ties and close working-relationships forged as a result of the activities of the Network will lead to the development of a larger funding bid to facilitate empirical work on the important - yet oft neglected - issue of collective worship in schools.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research will be of direct relevance to the following five groups of beneficiaries.

1. Public sector

Education is a devolved matter in Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland. The UK Government retains responsibility for such issues in England. This research will inform and influence developments of the law and policy around collective worship within each of these administrations. In so doing, it will encourage consideration of the role played by collective worship in contributing to spiritual development, moral education and community cohesion in schools. The research will also contribute towards the deliberations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights in the area. Beneficiaries in this group will include:

Educational policy-makers at national and devolved government level
Standing Advisory Councils on Religious Education, which advise local authorities on matters relating to religious education and collective worship
Educational inspection and regulation bodies (eg., Education &amp;amp; Training Inspectorate in Northern Ireland, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Education in Scotland, Estyn in Wales, Ofsted in England)
The Westminster Parliament's Joint Committee on Human Rights
Statutory equality and human rights bodies in Great Britain and Northern Ireland
Children's Commissioners (England, Northern Ireland, Scotland &amp;amp; Wales)

2. Third sector

The research will provide guidance (legal and educational) to third sector bodies who are concerned with the complex range of issues that surround collective worship in schools. The interdisciplinary nature of the research will encourage a holistic consideration of the issues and will raise awareness of the challenges and opportunities created by the compulsory provision of collective worship. Beneficiaries in this group will include: 

Religious groups
Non-religious belief / secular belief organisations
NGOs with an interest in religion in schools and collective assemblies (eg., ACCORD COALITION: http://accordcoalition.org.uk/2010/07/07/government-urged-to-repeal-laws-on-compulsory-collective-worship-in-schools-2/; and SPCK: http://www.assemblies.org.uk/about_us.php)

3. Professional/practitioner groups

The research will influence and inform practitioners and professional practice in the provision of collective worship in schools. It will foster an open dialogue as to whether current policies and practices achieve desirable goals. Beneficiaries in this group will include the: 

Teaching Unions
Professional Council for RE
Association of RE Inspectors
RE Council of England and Wales
National Association of Teachers of RE
National Association of Standing Advisory Councils on RE

4. Wider general public

The research will serve to raise public awareness and understanding of the issues surrounding current law and policy on collective worship in UK schools. It will encourage reflection on the links between school community and cohesion, social inclusion and collective worship. Furthermore, it will stimulate public debate on the challenge of developing and enhancing a sense of community and well-being amongst pupils throughout the UK which, in turn, has the potential to contribute to a better quality of life for individuals. Beneficiaries in this group will include:

Children
Parents
School communities

5. International beneficiaries

The research will develop the knowledge and experience of international stakeholders who are concerned with the complex debates around freedom of religion and belief in schools, community cohesion and moral education. Beneficiaries in this group will include the:

UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief 
UN Human Rights Committee
UN Committee on the Rights of the Child
Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODHIR)
European Forum for the Rights of the Child
Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>27261</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talk at policy forum</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A7BC67BB-2FAC-4A2B-AC07-7E1E8D330F08</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Network member presented the findings and recommendations of the Network at a policy forum on

The Report set out the law and policy relating to collective worship and religious observance in each country in the United Kingdom, and considered the merits of a range of options available to policy -makers. The Report's recommendations identified a number of significant issues related to current law and practice that require the attention of policy-makers as well as making recommendations on how the opportunities and challenges presented by the current statutory duties should be taken forward. 

The Report was launched and presented at a public conference held in Leicester, and attended by more than 60 participants drawn from the public, third/voluntary and academic sectors. Key stakeholders responded to the report, including representatives of the Department for Education Northern Ireland (DENI), Department for Education and Skills Wales (DfES), and the National Association of SACREs (Standing Advisory Council on Religious Education in England). The government stakeholders stated a willingness to report back the findings to the relevant ministers with DENI, in particular, indicating a readiness to consider a number of key recommendations, including the recommendation that governments establish a working group to consider the rationale for the current statutory with a view to deciding on future options (maintain, abolish or reform current duty). 

Future impact work will involve continued contact with key stakeholders (governments and statutory bodies) as these bodies continue consider the report's findings and recommendations. Already the Network representatives have been invited to attend and discuss the Report findings at a meeting in June of the Welsh Association of Standing Advisory Council on Religious Education (WASACRE), the body responsible for monitoring RE and collective worship in state schools in Wales.

The recommendations of the Report have been raised in The Scottish Parliament. On the 5 December 2015, Alison McInnes MSP lodged a written question in the Parliament, to ask the Scottish Government: 'what its position is on each of the Scotland-specific recommendations made by the Arts and Humanities Research Council on Collective Worship in its report, Collective Worship and Religious Observance in Schools: An Evaluation of Law and Policy in the UK.' In its reply the Government noted that 'Education Scotland is working to develop exemplification of good practice in Religious Observance/Time for Reflection in different contexts. This includes the important principle that young people should be involved in the planning, delivery and evaluation of it. Schools themselves can already decide whether to refer to these experiences as Religious Observance or Time for Reflection; no legal change is required to enable this.'

A Scottish member of the Research Network has recently been asked by Education Scotland (executive agency charged with supporting quality and improvement in Scottish education) to develop the idea of Philosophy with Children as an appropriate activity for Religious Observance/Time for Reflection in Scottish schools and to make this available on Education Scotland's website. The use of Philosophy with Children as a potential approach to reform of the current duty was proposed in the Network Report. 

In addition to its presentation at the public conference, the report been widely distributed to potential beneficiaries, including educational inspection and regulation bodies, parliamentary committees, child and human rights commissioners, religious and non-religion/secular belief organisations, and professional/practitioner groups. Initial reactions include comments on the timeliness of the report and its relevance to contemporary debates. For example, one county inspection authority in England will be using it to complement and inform its own research which it is currently conducting on the practice of collective worship in its local authority schools. 

The Report was widely disseminated to the media and, as such, has already contributed to public awareness and discussions on the role of collective worship in today's schools. For example, the Report's findings were reported in an article in The Independent newspaper and on the BBC education website where it was the most popular news item for four successive days. Furthermore, the researchers have taken part in radio discussions on both popular programmes (eg Radio Wales morning talk programme) and Radio 4's Sunday (religious affairs) programme in the wake of the Report's publication.

In December 2015, the Woolf Institute published a wide ranging report entitled the 'Report of the Commission on Religion and Belief in British Public Life'. In its section on Collective Worship in schools, it referenced the Network's Report and its discussions about possible options for the future of collective worship or religious observance. The Network's Report has also been referenced in the Equality and Human Rights Commissionreport: 'Religon or belief: is the law working?' (December 2016) and by civil soceity stakeholders (eg National Secular Society) making submissions to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, when the UK appeared before the Commitee in June 2016. The Committee on the Rights of the Children subsequently went on the issue a Recommendation dealing with the practice of collective worship and religious observance in the UK schools, a recommendation which reflected one made in the Network Report.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>3F17B064-B1F8-4DDE-8AB6-B6C22E5B92CF</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5464c7fcba1005.12945740</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The key objective of the work of the Research Network was to review current law and policy in each of England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales with respect to the current duties on schools to hold acts of collective worship and religious observance. Furthermore, the work aimed to explore and evaluate these duties against human rights standards and in light of religious change in the UK. The outputs of the Network, as well as a comprehensive listing of information and commentary on the law and policy relating to collective worship and religious observance, has been made available on the Network's website.

The fundamental finding from the work of the Network was that no clear and agreed rationale exists for the current duties relating to collective worship and religious observance. This absence of rationale makes it highly problematic for governments to evaluate existing law and policy, and to assess future approaches. 

The Network developed a framework of six questions to assist policy-makers in considering whether a rationale could exist that would require a collective compulsory activity within a distinct period in schools (as currently required by the duties of collective worship/religious observance). These questions prompt decision-makers to consider whether there is a rationale that derives from the personal needs of individuals, from the educational values and social needs of the school, from the needs of wider society, from a combination of the aforementioned personal, educational and social needs, and/or from a need to provide for a communal pupil experience. A final question directs decision-makers to consider whether it is only possible to fulfil any such needs through having a distinct period of time or, alternatively, whether they can be (or are already) adequately fulfilled through activities/subjects within the curriculum. 

With respect to evaluating the law and policy in each country, the Network found, inter alia, that in respect of:

(1) England and Wales: the aims for the duty of collective worship as set out in non-statutory guidance are contradictory in the context of a diverse pupil population, specifically the aims to provide an opportunity to worship God yet simultaneously to develop a community spirit and promote a common ethos;

(2) Northern Ireland: no guidance document exists to direct the implementation of the duty nor is the activity inspected. This absence means that little is known about how the duty is implemented in practice;

(3) Scotland: official guidance emphasises the promotion of the spiritual development of all members of the school community during acts of religious observance and recognises that for some schools 'Time for Reflection' might be a more appropriate descriptor. However, clearer guidance is required to help teachers understand what should and should not take place during religious observance/Time for Reflection. 

(4) All countries: significant concerns surround the protection of the right to freedom of religion or belief given the lack of information available to parents on the content of acts of collective worship/religious observance; the lack of knowledge around the right to opt out; the lack of meaningful educational alternatives for those wishing to opt-out; and the lack of a right for pupils to exercise an independent right to opt out.

While the work of the Network showed a need for empirical research to inform future law and policy, diversity in the education systems and relevant law in each country means that there is no benefit to be gained from a future UK-wide research project. Individual projects tailored to the issues pertaining in each country would be more beneficial.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings may be taken forward as follows:

1. Non-academic route: the findings may be used by policy-makers (ie Departments for Education) and key statutory stakeholders (eg the Standing Advisory Council on Religious Education in England; Welsh Association of Standing Advisory Council on Religious Education) to inform their thinking and approach to the current duties of Collective Worship/Religious Observance. These bodies, many of whom sent representatives to attend the Network's public conference, have been sent summaries of the papers presented at the Network's seminars as well as copies of the Network Report. Meetings have been held or are scheduled to be held with relevant bodies in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to discuss the Network's findings and recommendations in greater detail and how they can be taken forward. 

2. Academic route: researchers in a wide variety of fields will be able to draw on the holistic and inter-disciplinary approach taken by the Network to understanding the issues relating to the duties of Collective Worship/Religious Observance. For example, two PhD students carrying out doctoral work on the topic attended the public conference in Leicester at which the Report's findings were discussed and found the resulting discussions extremely beneficial for their own work.
