By studying how children?s choices are affected by bad outcomes, this project proposes a new way of determining whether regret facilitates profitable decision making. It is known that at six years of age only some children are capable of experiencing regret. There is also some evidence that the ability to experience regret is associated with the tendency to choose profitably in response to earlier bad outcomes.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project will explore whether the relationship between regret and decision making is a causal one, and whether good decision making depends on the ability to experience regret over a specific outcome, or the more general ability to anticipate regret. Finally, the project will examine whether the experience or anticipation of regret plays an important role in the ability to delay gratification, and in children?s decision making under conditions of risk. An associated postgraduate student will examine several of the same issues using adapted versions of the developmental tasks with patients who have difficulties experiencing or anticipating regret due to brain damage. These complementary lines of research will help to clarify the relationship(s) between regret and decision making.&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>There is now broad acknowledgement that regret plays a role in everyday decision making. For example, the role of regret in explaining or predicting health-related behaviours has attracted a great deal of recent interest from researchers and practitioners seeking to optimize preventative behaviours such as vaccination or reduce harmful behaviours such as taking up smoking. Researchers in these areas are beginning to consider what types of interventions may be able to influence these types of behaviour, given the assumption that regret plays a powerful role in determining whether or not they occur. Moreover, there is very recent evidence emerging that suggests problems in experiencing or anticipating regret may occur in the mental illnesses of schizophrenia and depression and may be associated with behavioural dysfunction. Last, in the area of neuroeconomics there is a great deal of interest in how regret may influence economic choices, particularly under conditions in which choices are risky and can lead to financial losses as well as gains. The potential impact of all of these lines of more applied research is clear: understanding the role of regret may lead to more effective interventions or a better understanding of behaviour that is important in everyday life. Thus, it seems highly likely that these lines of research will have a direct impact on practice or policy. While we do not anticipate that the findings of our own research will have this sort of direct impact, we do believe that our findings will speak to the basic assumptions underpinning these strands of research regarding the relationship between regret and decision-making. Thus, our impact plan will necessarily focus on engaging researchers who conduct these more applied lines of research. 

We note also that there is a great deal of interest amongst more applied researchers in the development of decision-making because of known associations between decision-making and important developmental outcomes. Much of this research has focused on adolescent decision-making (e.g., seeking to explain, and ultimately intervene on and reduce, risk-seeking behaviour in adolescents). However, some longitudinal studies have also indicated predictive relationships between decision-making in younger children and developmental outcomes. Moreover, numerous studies of developmental disorders, particularly ADHD, have been concerned with examining whether they may be associated with particular styles of decision-making (e.g., difficulty delaying gratification) that may underlie some behavioural problems. We deliberately focus on risky decision-making and delay of gratification in the proposed project because of the practical importance of these types of decision-making highlighted by these lines of applied developmental research. Again, we think that the impact of our research will be maximized through ensuring that these types of applied researchers become aware of our findings.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-04-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>319270</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>EPS Science of Regret Workshop.

The importance of regret to adult decision making has long been understood, with much theoretical emphasis placed on adults' ability to anticipate the regret that might arise out of decision outcomes. We have demonstrated the importance to children's emerging ability to make decisions of their ability to experience regret. 

In particular, our research has shown that by six years of age, the ability to experience regret over a bad decision outcome is associated with the tendency to choose differently when given the opportunity to make the same decision again. Furthermore, we have shown that because children do not develop the ability to anticipate regret until one or two years after the ability to experience regret emerges, this association cannot be attributed to the ability to anticipate regret. Instead, our findings suggest that the experience of regret makes it more likely that children will spontaneously remember a previously encountered negative outcome when given the opportunity to choose again. This suggests that the experience of regret may play an important role as children use environmental feedback when learning how to make decisions. 

One particular type of decision we have studied is the decision to delay gratification. While failures to delay gratification are often characterized as potential sources of regret, our findings suggest that the experience of regret over a decision not to delay gratification may help children to decide to delay gratification when they are next presented with the same choice. Given the importance of the ability to delay gratification, these results have the potential to inform interventions designed to help children learn how to defer reward. 

Finally, our results contribute to what is known about the relationship between emotion and decisions to take risks during development. Adults are known to be regret responsive in that they take more risks upon realizing that they have missed an opportunity. We have shown that such regret responsiveness emerges at eight-years of age and that it increases through adolescence and into adulthood. Interestingly, six-year old children who are capable of experiencing regret when explicitly asked about their feelings, do not demonstrate regret responsiveness. These results (a) address questions about the age at which the ability to experience regret might affect children's decisions in the real world and (b) suggest that more research may be needed to address relationships in adolescence between emotion and risky decision making. Although adolescents are often thought to take more risks when making decisions in &amp;quot;hot&amp;quot; emotional states, our results suggest that the effects on risk taking of evaluative emotions such as regret are greater in adulthood than they are in adolescence. 

Taken together, these results support the suggestion that regret is a functional emotion which often results in adaptive decision making.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We see two obvious ways in which our findings may be taken forward. First, we found that at six years of age the experience of regret over a failure to delay gratification is associated with a tendency to choose to delay gratification when presented with the same choice a second time. This finding may have implications for the design of interventions to help children learn to delay rewards. In particular, showing children the opportunities they have missed out on through a bad decision may help them to learn to choose better in the future. Second, we have found that the experience - rather than the anticipation - of regret is associated with adaptive decision making in young children. Results of recent interventions based on anticipated regret on adults' health-related decision making have been mixed. Our results with children suggest that interventions which cause participants to bring to mind previous experiences of regret may be an effective way of improving their decision making.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>CC6F82DB-9752-4D72-AC5D-E6B4348EA8D3</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-2383996557.801958677622976</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.epsscienceofregret.com/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5216C32B-4D46-4739-94C8-CD8A07733653</gtr:id><gtr:title>Do children who experience regret make better decisions?
