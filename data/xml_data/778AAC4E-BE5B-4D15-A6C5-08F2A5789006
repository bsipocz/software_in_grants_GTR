They nevertheless continue to pose a major problem in both underdeveloped and developed countries, causing widespread suffering, death and economic damage. They now present an ominous threat as we change the environment e.g. industrialising the food chain, and as bacteria become more and more resistant to antibiotics.
The infamous bacterial pathogen Salmonella causes food-borne diarrhoeal disease in countries like ours, and life-threatening illness in the developing world, especially among children and people with weakened immune systems. Following human ingestion, e.g. via meat or eggs, Salmonella forces its way into cells of the host intestine and provokes a host immune response which causes nausea, cramps, and diarrhoea. Salmonella is able to survive this immune response, and it multiplies rapidly, generating ever-stronger disease. 
To initiate host invasion Salmonella delivers into target intestinal cells a battery of 'effector' proteins, which hijack control of the host cell cytoskeleton and cell shape. Salmonella uses several ways to achieve this crucial step. Our laboratory has recently found a mechanism that requires two host cell 'molecular switches', named Arf1 and Rac1, to be turned on to cause Salmonella to be internalised. Salmonella directs its effector SopE to activate Rac1, while hijacking a comparable host protein, ARNO, to activate Arf1. We will apply cell biology and biochemical approaches to investigate precisely how SopE and ARNO cooperate, how Salmonella controls this process, and whether other important bacterial pathogens use the same or similar strategy to initiate disease. We will study the other pathways Salmonella uses to get inside cells, and how the host immune system responds to the changes driven by these bacterial intruders. The information gained will provide new insights into how bacteria exploit host cells, enhance understanding of key processes in our own cells, and may reveal new pathogen targets to combat infection.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Salmonella imposes a huge global burden of morbidity and mortality. A key early step in establishing this invasive infection is breaching the intestinal epithelium, and Salmonella achieves this by delivering virulence effector proteins directly into target cells, often to the plasma membrane. Here they manipulate host cell signalling pathways, to drive actin-dependent membrane ruffling and force pathogen internalisation, and to induce inflammation.
To better understand these crucial events underlying infection, I developed a powerful in vitro reconstitution system to faithfully replicate signalling platforms in their native membrane environment. Using this, my laboratory has already revealed activation of the WAVE regulatory complex (WRC), one of the cell's key regulators of actin assembly and cell shape, is directed by a novel cooperation between Arf and Rac GTPases. We demonstrated the first instance of pathogen subversion of this newly uncovered aspect of cytoskeletal control, revealing a remarkable interplay between pathogen and host as two guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), Salmonella SopE and host ARNO, cooperate to exploit the Arf-Rac1-WAVE pathway for Salmonella cell invasion.
We will build on these findings to fully define the Arf GTPase network subverted by Salmonella to activate WRC at the membrane. We will extend our studies to each of the distinct parallel GTPase-dependent mechanisms used by Salmonella to force entry into target cells, continuing to combine a range of biochemical, biophysical and cell biology approaches to provide a coherent molecular description of the Salmonella cell invasion platform. Finally we will disect how Salmonella and related pathogens hijack the host's innate immune response via manipulation of GTPase signalling. Defining how these multiple GTPase platforms are assembled, integrated and subverted will be crucial to understanding, and potentially intervening in, this pivotal early step in Salmonella infection.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Impact on Society
Bacterial infections have had a defining impact on human society and remain a huge global burden, causing millions of human deaths and a much higher level of morbidity every year, with infections of food-chain animals adding to the resulting debilitating economic impact. The threat is exacerbated by the inexorable increase in multidrug resistance, and the stalled development of antimicrobials and vaccines. Indeed, our societies are still absolutely reliant on antibacterial drugs discovered decades ago, a remarkable and increasingly ominous situation. It is now vital that cutting edge combinatorial biology is applied to uncover and understand the cell components and pathways, the hijack mechanisms, that underlie bacterial pathogenesis, with the result that we will identify novel therapeutic targets and strategies to combat bacterial disease. Part of combating disease is generating public awareness. By learning about research like ours the public become aware of the science behind the global health threat that will be posed in the future by re-emergent resistant bacteria. Such an understanding is important in seeking to augment research support and foster future scientists. 
Impact on Academia
Our research has broad appeal to scientists in academia beyond our field to which we aim to make a timely and important impact. This is typified by our focus on Ras superfamily GTPases (~150 members), as our scientific advances will have direct relevance to small GTPase pathways such as the cell cycle, polarity and movement, cytoskeleton, vesicular and nuclear transport, that underlie human cell biology and pathology. For example, mutated Ras is common in cancers, and deregulated Rho, Rab and Arf GTPases, often mediated through the aberrant activities of GEFs and GAPs (eg. Rac1 GEFs PREX1, VAV1 and 2, TIAM1), are important in cancer progression. Our advances will have impact on this and related topics. 
In addition to our findings and resultant ideas, my reconstitution of membrane platforms resulted from 10 years of focussed research building on my membrane protein expertise. This technological advance, now routine in my lab and under further development, is widely applicable and available to scientists studying a range of pathways at the membrane and will undoubtedly have an impact on future research. Continued funding would enable me to further develop this methodology and augment its cross-disciplinary nature (eg. by reconstituting immune signalling). 
Impact on Industry
One of our research goals is to exploit our reconstitution approach to gain new in depth knowledge about the parallel invasion pathways and immunosignalling cascades triggered by Salmonella to penetrate host cells and establish infection. Armed with this information we aim to block these multiple pathways and bacterial invasion into host cells, where appropriate in collaboration. This information could highlight potential targets for therapeutic intervention and would be of interest to industry scientists combating infection. 
Impact on Research Staff
Our group has a strong background in training outstanding bacteriologists highly skilled not only in microbiology, but also structural and cell biology and biochemistry. Our RAs and PhDs publish in excellent journals and have gained Research Fellowships and Faculty positions in the UK and abroad, and positions in pharmaceutical research institutes. Indeed we currently have two RAs applying for Research Fellowships, and in recent weeks one RA was offered a University Lectureship. It was 10 years ago that the Academy of Medical Science highlighted the dearth of sophisticated bacteriology research in the UK, and it is crucial that the quite small number of groups like ours continue to produce high quality scientists. Continued MRC support will allow us to further foster the principal investigators of the future to be at the forefront of cellular and molecular microbiology research.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-05-05</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-05-06</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>515220</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5B062610-AEE1-4072-B604-2A2CF18EE208</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Arf GTPase-activating protein family is exploited by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium to invade nonphagocytic host cells.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>mBio</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/72a40df2a091fe9ad238668ce325b54f"><gtr:id>72a40df2a091fe9ad238668ce325b54f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Davidson AC</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56d05d370c4db4.95575374</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B473C8FA-E5E3-43A4-8509-C65510E81274</gtr:id><gtr:title>Inhibition of WAVE Regulatory Complex Activation by a Bacterial Virulence Effector Counteracts Pathogen Phagocytosis.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Cell reports</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ebad17a18bd893946dc4d394e1ec5af2"><gtr:id>ebad17a18bd893946dc4d394e1ec5af2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Humphreys D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58bd3fc99ef5e4.65454583</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>29E0A2B9-4CEA-4FFC-8DDB-693ABC020847</gtr:id><gtr:title>Arf GTPase interplay with Rho GTPases in regulation of the actin cytoskeleton.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Small GTPases</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/00d7673f8c199287b692989e5f71228e"><gtr:id>00d7673f8c199287b692989e5f71228e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Singh V</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2154-1248</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a94315e52f254.59775371</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>DC51EC88-B74A-4EFE-9451-BAF918F7DC48</gtr:id><gtr:title>Swiss Army Pathogen: TheEntry Toolkit.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/76b25627c43c99a309797acedf85d5fe"><gtr:id>76b25627c43c99a309797acedf85d5fe</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hume PJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2235-2988</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a3612dc3a6e23.94618842</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>51F90185-BBC4-4C7C-9CEE-3840AE2E6583</gtr:id><gtr:title>MYO6 is targeted byvirulence effectors to trigger PI3-kinase signaling and pathogen invasion into host cells.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d7d7c9dd9837806c55d576b5c8725e20"><gtr:id>d7d7c9dd9837806c55d576b5c8725e20</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Brooks AB</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0027-8424</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fd5f1ea73f0.33784861</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/L008122/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>03BA7BC9-C251-48FC-8EA9-5F7414A63FEE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Infection</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>CDB856E6-DF2D-4D96-88BD-1CC96FE277EF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.2  Factors relating to physical environment</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
