The related treatment usually starts by introducing a small parameter which represents the plate thickness, and seeks a procedure for passing to the limit as the parameter tends to zero. In the setting of linearised elasticity the related 2D limit theory, which is sometimes referred to as the ``Kirchhoff-Love theory'', has been extensively studied starting since 1970's. However, the rigorous nonlinear, frame-indifferent, plate theories have only been addressed recently in the membrane-limit context and also in the flexural and von Karman regimes.The above rigorous approaches to nonlinear plate theories can be termed classical in the sense that they work under the assumption of uniform coercivity of the underlying stored-energy function. It would be practically important, however, to try to understand what additional effects emerge when the material of which a thin body is made allows for significantly larger strains in some parts of it than in others. Another feature that limits the applicability of these recent results is that they only apply to homogeneous plates, while the vast majority of the materials used nowadays in industry are ``composites'', whose mathematical 3D theory has been fairly well developed, at least in the classical periodic context. The present project will address these two shortcomings of the existing theories. In the wider mathematical context this will serve three major objectives: 1) To make the mathematical theory of plates more complete by providing a rigorous derivation of a wider class of models, including some that are more realistic; 2) To bridge the gap between the homogenisation theory and the existing nonlinear plate theories; 3) To make an advance on ``non-classical'' effects, such as the in-plane non-locality in the overall response, for realistic plates. In the applied context, it will generate new developments in the design of composites, and a more recent class of metamaterials , which are difficult to obtain experimentally by trial and error.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research concerns the development of mathematical tools for understanding the behaviour of composites, i.e. materials whose exceptional overall properties are attained by a process of ``mixing'' several other, more basic, materials. The main beneficiaries outside the academic community are research labs and industries engaged in developing new composite materials. Using my links to some of the UK research centres who already have industrial partners, I will develop my own contacts with these partners and will establish a mechanism for effective knowledge transfer. I plan regular meetings with the mentioned UK centres, which will involve appropriate impact activities such as research presentations and collaborative workshops. I will also make use of my overseas visits in order to develop longer-term links with overseas beneficiaries, including those in the commercial sector. On the scale of several years from now, my results may lead to the design of a wide spectrum of high-quality consumer products that rely on advanced materials for improved performance. From this perspective the project has a potential for enhancing the quality of life, and thereby the wider public is a likely beneficiary.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>207140</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>I studied the properties of thin periodic composite elastic plates in bending regime. The thickness of the plate and the period of composite are small parameters. Different ratios between the thickness and the period result in different elastic properties of the plate. The purpose of the research is to derive a two-dimensional plate model describing the limit behaviour of the plate. In particular I have discovered that in certain regimes, when the thickness is significantly smaller than the period, the plate shows very non-standard behaviour, being &amp;quot;everywhere discontinuously anisotropic&amp;quot;. Such properties are normally not present in nature, and usually attributed to so-called metamaterials.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The composite plate model may potentially be used for manufacturing materials with new mechanical properties. The theoretical tools developed in this project may be used in further research in theories of plates, rods and shells.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>645097AA-63B8-4EDC-91EC-BABACB85B85A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54647c0cb06df3.78876370</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Construction,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0D50A114-C6BB-485B-A0FD-54BF0E74473D</gtr:id><gtr:title>High contrast homogenisation in nonlinear elasticity under small loads</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Asymptotic Analysis</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d21369f3edfc52187f94c0174dbcced6"><gtr:id>d21369f3edfc52187f94c0174dbcced6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cherdantsev M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0921-7134</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a351b83246a07.04444068</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0170416A-B71D-4269-A750-B4BA66F4B910</gtr:id><gtr:title>Homogenisation of periodic elastic membranes.</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7a528cfd466cba66749db234c1fe26a3"><gtr:id>7a528cfd466cba66749db234c1fe26a3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cherdantsev M.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>546470b81d9b66.33335102</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7BE820A3-0374-4F00-A606-072CBE82BF74</gtr:id><gtr:title>Bending of thin periodic plates</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Calculus of Variations and Partial Differential Equations</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d21369f3edfc52187f94c0174dbcced6"><gtr:id>d21369f3edfc52187f94c0174dbcced6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cherdantsev M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5464707a870715.33138873</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/H028587/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>02B9E893-AC2F-436D-BF88-28E1AC827F5D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>60</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Continuum Mechanics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>93E27C3B-6D00-4F18-BBE3-96C05C8F92B2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Non-linear Systems Mathematics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
