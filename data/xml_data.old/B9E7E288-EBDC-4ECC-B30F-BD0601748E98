A new National Space Academy has been launched this year to help boost the size and quality of the UK's science and engineering expertise. The proposal supports strongly The UK Space Directory, an organisation of eight groups representing and supporting the UK space community and including the Technology Strategy Board that state &amp;quot;the UK Space Industry has come together to propose an ambitious 20 year strategy to capture 10% of the global space market, &amp;pound;40 billion, by 2030 and in doing so create 100,000 UK jobs&amp;quot;. The UK houses some of the leading companies in space applications such as; Inmarsat, Rolls Royce, Logica, Vega Space, Astrium, Qioptiq Space Technology and Surrey Satellite Technology Limited. The latter two companies strongly back the research detailed within this proposal and have both provided satements of support.

This proposal seeks to offer an alternative PV technology for large area arrays and to be the first to report thin film cadmium telluride (CdTe) deposited directly onto toughened cerium-doped microsheet glass (CMG), explicitly targeting a significant increase in specific power by a step-change reduction of system weight. The Qioptiq Space Technology CMG microsheet glass is optimised to match the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of gallium arsenide (GaAs) based space solar cells. With the CdTe CTE almost identical to that of GaAs the choice of CMG is ideal for the prevention of delamination under the severe thermal gradients to which space PV is exposed. This adventurous approach, using the CMG as both the radiation barrier and substrate, will be proven by characterisation of 5 x 5 cm2 deposited devices and finally scaled to 10 x 20 cm2 on the Centre for Solar Energy Research (CSER) pilot metalorganic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD) system.

This proposal has the content and vision to make a significant contribution to the UK's flourishin space industry. Key to the success of the project will be the dissemination and pathways to impact of the research outcomes; this will be ensured through regular reporting to and feedback from a steering group of potential exploiters-Industrial experts and through targeted press releases. This proposal offers UK research the chance to impact the space PV market either through licencing of the arising IP and more excitingly in the current economic climate through manufacture of the final product.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This proposal has the content and vision to make a significant contribution to the UK's flourishing space industry.

This proposal offers UK research the chance to impact the space PV market either through licencing of the arising IP and more excitingly in the current economic climate through manufacture of the final product.

The cost of PV for space deployment is now of significant importance, evidenced by the theme for this year's Space Power Workshop, California being &amp;quot;Maintaining Excellence in Space Power in a Cost-Constrained Environment&amp;quot;. The future for space exploration and exploitation offers exciting opportunities for such an alternative, cost-effective solution as flexible thin film CdTe PV. Its potential higher specific power and significantly reduced cost of production fit well with firstly; large arrays for either in space or prospective lunar and Martian bases. Secondly, solar electric propulsion (SEP) in space which is deemed essential for future human exploration missions to deep space. Finally, space qualified CdTe PV addresses the concept of space-based solar power (SBSP), a method of collecting solar power in space for use on Earth. NASA expects this concept to be a reality within the next 10 to 50 years and support of this proposal would position the UK well to play a lead role thus generating high-tech jobs and economic growth.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-03-03</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-03-04</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>331895</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Surrey</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Advanced Technology Institute (ATI)</gtr:department><gtr:description>AlSat-Nano satelite payload</gtr:description><gtr:id>EC88D175-AC2A-4F86-9E1D-CF1B4CAC8EC5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A paper has been accepted for oral presentation at the PVSAT 13 conference in Bangor, April 2017 http://www.pvsat.org.uk/ and a journal paper is in preparation.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6a2a272dc24.28027603-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The Surrey Space Centre provided the test electronics to measure the solar cell performance and to communicate the data with the spacecraft communications link.

The reason for this was previous work carried out in the Netherlands which showed that the thin film PV being investigated would de-laminate in the harsh environment of space. The approach taken in this research has been to deposit the solar cell structure straight onto space qualified protective cover-glass. This cover-glass also matches the thermal expansion coefficient of the thin film PV structure which minimises strain under thermal shock. The mechanical, thermal and radiation robustness of this new solar cell structure have been remarkable and one of our industrial partners, Surrey Satellite Technology Limited (SSTL) is now lobbying ESA to take a fresh look at thin film PV for space. The impressive early results in both PV performance and robustness have led to the research team being selected to provide a thin film PV payload for the UKSA Al-Sat Nano mission due to be launched in 2016. This will be the first flight test of thin film PV directly onto space qualified cover glass and will provide valuable space heritage and evidence for the robustness of these cells.

It is unfortunate that there is no further funding to take this research forward to the point where it can be taken-up by one of the industrial partners. An EPSRC research proposal to carry out further research has been rejected and it is too early stage for Innovate UK which will require an industrial partner to lead the project. Key research questions that need to be answered before this technology can be taken forward entail the performance of the lamination structure that is necessary for space deployment and improvements in cell and module level efficiency that entail a better fundamental understanding of the semiconductor doping properties. With this further research we would unlock a truly amazing new high specific power PV technology for deployment in space, for UAVs and even for building integration.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>CAE04A93-5863-4544-8472-B39056AF0B97</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d85acdc00c97.05125777</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Electronics,Energy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Thin film solar cells have been deposited for the first time onto space qualified ultra-thin (100 micron) cover glass. During this research project the solar cell efficiency has been increased from 7% to over 15% AM1.5 and 13% under the space AM0 conditions. Based on these results it has been possible to predict a world beating power to weight ratio for space durable solar cells of over 0.6 kW/kg.

With our partners at the University of Surrey these solar cells have been put through a rigorous set of mechanical, thermal and radiation tests. These thin film solar cells have been demonstrated to be very robust with no degradation under 10 cycles of thermal shock testing (-200C to +80 C). Mechanical bend and pull tests have similarly shown excellent adhesion of the films and in general failure only occurring when the glass substrate fails.

Radiation testing using 500 MeV protons from the unprotected solar cell side have shown better radiation hardness than previously reported radiation tests on thin film PV and a thousand times the radiation hardness of the multi-junction solar cells normally used for powering satellites. Furthermore, under the very high dose of 1E14 cm-2 where the efficiency decreased to 90% of its initial performance, it was possible to recover to 90% through annealing under conditions experienced in Earth orbit. This raises the prospect that these very robust thin film solar cells could be self healing.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The results of this research grant are likely to be taken forward through the following:
1. By researchers working on space deployment and in particular deployment of flexible PV arrays.
2. Utra-light weight PV for other applications such as Unmanned Arial Vehicles (UAVs) and for terrestrial applications such as coating industrial roofs with light weight PV.
3. Understanding fundamental properties of thin film structures under harsh conditions.
