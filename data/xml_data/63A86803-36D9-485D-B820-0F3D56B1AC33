These linkages pose a significant challenge to both macroeconomists and financial economists.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Macro models often summarize the entire financial sector by a few interest rates and finance models typically include only a few macroeconomic indicators to capture a minimum set of information about the macroeconomic environment. However, the recent crises uncovered that bond prices respond to a large set of shocks, and that monetary policy reacts to financial conditions in an attempt to stabilise the economy. In addition, as the short rates hit the zero-lower bound, Central Banks acted on long-term government bonds to provide additional stimulus to the economy. This evidence calls for government bond models that include information about the entire economy allowing for the presence of a large number of macroeconomic, financial and international indicators. &lt;br />&lt;br />The aim of this project is to develop and apply models for large datasets to the context of government bonds focussing on the investigation of the government bond risk premium and on the predictive power of government bonds for economic activity.&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The outputs of this research will improve our understanding the determinants of the government bond risk premium and help to develop more accurate early warning indicators for economic activity. This work will have immediate relevance to a broad user community outside of academia, including Central Bankers, governments and institutional investors around the world.

The principal impacts that the outputs of the proposed research will have include:
1) Improving Central Banks ability to assess market expectations of inflation, through analyzing the government bond risk premium; such information is an important determinant in decisions about setting of short-term interest rates.
2) Helping HM Treasury, and Finance Ministries in other countries, to determine the best mix of securities to issue in order to minimise their funding costs. 
3) Assisting pension funds, insurance companies and other financial organisation to properly measure the government bond risk premium, and thus to determine their optimal asset allocation policies and maximize their performance.

Further impact of this research will arise because using the yield curve of government bonds to construct early warning indicators of improvement or deterioration in the economic conditions will also contribute to increase the effectiveness of monetary and fiscal policies for two reasons:
1) Governments rely on GDP growth predictions to analyze the sustainability of publicly financed social welfare systems and design government budgets.
2) Monetary policy decisions are based on assessments about the current and future economic outlook.

The impact among users will be harnessed through disseminating results in working papers, articles, conferences and seminars in policy institutions. The Principal Investigator will also organize a one day conference for academics, policy makers and institutional investors. In addition, as detailed in the CV, the Principal Investigator has a track record of user engagement, particularly with Central Banks, including research visits, collaborations and seminar presentations. The Principal Investigator will seek to develop these skills further, with the guidance of her mentors and profiting of the relevant training sessions organized within the University of Manchester.

In summary, the recent financial, economic and sovereign debt crises have highlighted how financial markets and economic activity around the world are strongly interconnected. Developing models that allow for the presence of a large number of macroeconomic, financial and international indicators for the analysis of the government bond premium and for constructing early warning indicators of economic activity will contribute to our understanding of recent empirical phenomena. This has a strong potential to contribute to foster the global economic performance and increase the effectiveness of monetary and fiscal policies. For these reasons, the Principal Investigator will aim to maximize the impact of research findings to a broad user community.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>159992</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of York</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Creation of the Centre for Applied Macro-Finance at the University of York</gtr:description><gtr:id>6923F6EA-1F1E-4C1C-B1C0-60E9194B4BBC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Seminars

The Coroneo, Giannone and Modugno (2016) paper has been presented to a large set of audiences and so far the impact of this paper can be summarised as follows:

1) The paper was published as a Federal Reserve Board of Governors Discussion Paper, this the discussion paper series of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the US monetary policy authority). 

2) The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the US monetary policy authority) used the methodology of Coroneo, Giannone and Modugno (2016) to analyse the decline in long-term interest rates, results were incorporated in a policy note presented at the Federal Open Market Committee meeting of March 2015. 

3) The South African Reserve Bank requested the codes of the Coroneo, Giannone and Modugno (2016) paper to investigate the possibility of the South African yield curve being determined by the US yield curve. 

4) The National Bank of Belgium extended their JDemetra+ software in order to include the specification of the paper Coroneo, Giannone and Modugno (2016). The JDemetra+ is the software for conducting seasonal adjustment of official statistics within European Statistical System and European System of Central Banks.

5) Now-Casting Economics Ltd, a specialist economic forecasting business that publishes high frequency economic forecasting data from an automated platform, is adapting the model in Coroneo, Giannone and Modugno (2016) to their business.

6) The paper is cited by the ECB (ECB Working Paper No. 1632) and Federal Reserve Bank of Saint Francisco (Working Paper 2015-01).

The impact of the Coroneo and Iacone (2016) paper is as follows:

1) The paper was invited for a presentation to the 36th International Symposium on Forecasting (ISF) in Santander. The ISF is organised by the International Institute of Forecasters, which aims at bridging the gap between theory and practice by bringing together researchers and practitioners. The ISF is the premier forecasting conference, attracting the world's leading forecasting researchers and practitioners. The presentation was attended by senior officials of US Federal Reserve Banks and European Institutions. 

2) The National Bank of Belgium is implementing the test in Coroneo and Iacone (2015) in the JDemetra+ software. The JDemetra+ is the software for conducting seasonal adjustment of official statistics within European Statistical System and European System of Central Banks. The Coroneo and Iacone (2015) test is being used within this framework to determine the optimal time to update the seasonal adjustment and also for forecast evaluation.

The impact of the Coroneo (2016) paper is as follows:

1) The paper was invited for a presentation at the Monetary Analysis division of the Bank of England;

2) The paper is cited by the Swedish Central Bank (Riksbank Research Paper Series No. 159) and by the Bank of Spain (Banco de Espana Working Paper No. 1627).

Finally, the working paper Coroneo and Pastorello (2017) has been presented at the Fiscal Policy Symposium at the University of York, and a large number of institutions have requested a draft of the paper. We are in the process of finalising a full draft to distribute and present in the coming months. This paper is expected to generate a significant impact given the novelty of the techniques and the application to a very important policy-relevant issue.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>2E238FF5-CE31-489B-9F86-469F16CE1F98</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>546098af03c671.52859093</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The research funded by the grant achieved three objectives:

1) Development of models for large datasets and their application to investigate the determinants of the government bond risk premium from a macro-finance perspective. 

2) Development of a testing procedure to examine the conduct of monetary policy.

3) Development of a testing procedure to evaluate economic forecasts.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The funded research can be used by:
1) Central Banks: the analysis of the government bond risk premium improves Central Banks ability to assess inflation expectations, which is an important determinant in their policy making decisions.
3) HM Treasury and Finance Ministries in other countries: understanding the bond risk premium helps Finance Ministries to determine the best mix of securities to issue in order to minimise their funding costs.
4) Pension funds, insurance companies and other financial organisation: properly measuring the government bond risk premium helps to determine their optimal asset allocation policies and maximize their performance.
5) Economic agents: understanding the type of monetary policy conducted by the central bank allows any economic agent to form better expectations of the future paths of short term interest rates and inflation, which are key determinants in long term decision making.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>FA32682B-2733-49EF-88C3-687C4EACE113</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546094f52342e0.68586950</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>North America</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>26F0AA7D-FA9F-47F2-8729-D2C77AD3F9C7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the US monetary policy authority) used the model developed in Coroneo, Giannone and Modugno (2014) to understand the recent decline in long term interest rates.

The Coroneo and Iacone (2015) test is being used within this framework for two purposes: 

1) to determine the optimal time to update the seasonal adjustment. Results were presented at the 10th International Conference on Computational and Financial Econometrics (CFE 2016) that took place at the Higher Technical School of Engineering, University of Seville, Spain, 9-11 December 2016.

2) for forecast evaluation.
