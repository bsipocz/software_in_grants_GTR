This proposal involves development of new reactions that can be used to quickly assemble high value molecules from simple, cheap starting materials using relatively benign conditions. The results of this research program will lead to more efficient synthesis, a key objective for environmentally responsible manufacturing.

Specifically, we have developed cycloaddition reactions that give molecules that closely resemble alkaloid natural products with medicinal value. We anticipate that such cycloadducts will be useful for modulation of novel biological targets and may have direct value for development of future agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals. The broad utility of this synthesis therefore offers lasting economic and scientific value from its application in future.

Molecules with specific symmetry, or handedness, are very important for obtaining selective pharmaceutical molecules. There are no examples of an asymmetric version of the proposed cycloaddition reactions, thus we have set out to investigate and invent reactions that efficiently deliver cycloadducts as individual stereoisomers.

We plan to showcase these new, powerful reactions by completing a very concise synthesis of a complex alkaloid natural product called securinine. Essentially, we plan to break the record for efficient production of this alkaloid. Securinine is particularly interesting because it has been reported to cause selective controlled shut-down (apoptosis) of colon cancer cells. A reliable, high yielding route to analogues may help identification of the biological pathway by which this compound works and ultimately inform future discovery of novel therapies for the treatment of cancer.

This proposal will generate know-how that can be easily transferred to high value industries and will train the next generation of innovators in this vital economic sector.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research?
i) Pharmaceutical and Agrochemical Industry - Novel molecular scaffolds are urgently required to address and define novel biological targets and ultimately define intellectual property.
ii) Scientists in Biological Sciences - Require novel molecules for use as probes that uncover novel biological understanding, often leading to fresh intellectual property
iii) UK economy - Chemistry contributed &amp;pound;258 millon (21% GDP) to the UK economy in 2010, many leading pharmaceutical (e.g. GSK, AZ etc.) and agrochemical (Syngenta etc.) companies are either based in the UK. or have significant operations there. 
iv) UK Food Security - It also remains the case that agrochemicals required for future food security are based on new small molecule scaffolds.
v) UK Manufacturing - Methods that allow efficient production of compounds using environmentally benign conditions are essential for improved profit and safe manufacture. This chemistry may be used to supply ingredients for fast moving commercial goods, such as flavours and fragrances in future. The reaction may also be used for supply of modern materials. All require trained synthetic chemists. 
vi) UK Health - It remains the case that most new therapeutics are based on new synthetic, small molecules such as those proposed.
vii) UK Society - Society is enriched by the benefits of synthesis, directly in the form of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, dyes, flavours, fragrances, healthcare and cosmetic products.
How will they benefit from this research?
a) A collaborative studentship with AstraZeneca, starting October 2011 on related research, will ensure effective transfer know-how and potentially compounds for evaluation. This will happen immediately, within the lifetime of the grant.
b) Related chemical industries will benefit the increased productivity arising from efficient synthesis delivered by this research program. This will be delivered through printed and electronic media during and immdiately after the funding period.
c) This research will deliver an individual trained in efficient synthesis of complex molecules required by many companies representing a substantial portion of the UK economy, other group members, such as PhD students will also receive training and know-how by contact with this part of our research program. This will happen during and immediately after the funding period. All but two of Dowden's group recruited in Nottingham have entered the UK chemical industry immediately after taking part in 
d) Compounds will be made available to the University of Nottingham managed compound collection, which in turn can be accessed for high throughput screening by researchers in any group using this service. This will allow provide the greatest opportunity to marry compounds with biological targets, potentially leading to new intellectual property and therefore economic activity. This will happen as compounds are produced during the funding period.
e) Compounds will also be made available to Dowden's existing collaborators on a similar basis for examination in T-cells for immunotherapy, or zebrafish for developmental screening. This will happen as compounds are produced during the funding period.
f) The wider public will benefit from increased productivity in the UK economy arising from the trained individual and possibly rapid access to biologically active compounds in the longer term. Impacts on future healthcare or food security may occur in the longer term if any specific compounds make it to market. Such an impact may take several years and depend on the value of the compound. The chances of such a compound making it to market are slim, but would be considered worthwhile if it were to be used to counter diseases such as cancer or various bacterial and viral infections.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>339660</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>AstraZeneca</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Research and Development AstraZeneca</gtr:department><gtr:description>CASE award</gtr:description><gtr:id>472A05AB-D5F5-4FA4-B976-B8345103736D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Publication</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5457366a33c885.09469528-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Hosted student for three months.
