As a consequence, surface molecules can be exchanged. We will use an antibody-directed toxin approach to deplete recipient cells that have acquired donor MHC class II molecules (and vice versa) to study their contribution towards the rejection process in a mouse kidney allograft model. An anti donor MHC class II antibody will be used to direct a 'toxin' (gelonin) towards cells that express donor class II MHC molecules. If the donor (but not recipient) cells are resistant to the toxin, then only recipient (Multi drug resistant gene knockout mice which are toxin sensitive) cells that have acquired donor class II MHC molecules will be lysed. This will enable us to determine the relative contribution of this process to the alloresponse. We have synthesized this immunotoxin and demonstrated its effectiveness both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro experiments will also be performed to investigate the ability of the phenomenon to link the direct and indirect antigen presentation pathways. Understanding the consequences of MHC transfer will also have important implications in other fields where antigen presentation is involved, such as tumor immunology, vaccination, infection and auto-immune diseases.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Cell to cell interaction within the immune system takes place within the immunological synapse.

Although exchange of cell surface molecules had been know for some time. However, despite research efforts in recent years, its functional consequence in a situation relevant to real life, as oppose to simulated in vitro settings, is still unknown. Models to study this had been lacking as it is not possible to stop intercellular molecular transfer in vivo. The experiments proposed here can address some of these questions that many had not been able to answer for a long time. 2. The model we have devised here using immunotoxin and animals that have enhanced sensitivity to the toxin is novel. We have already demonstrated its effectiveness and can be used in other areas of biomedical research to address different questions.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>424274</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>King?s Health Partners</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>King's Health Partners Academic Health Science Centre (NIHR BRC)</gtr:department><gtr:description>Proteinomics studies in lymphatic fluid following transplantation</gtr:description><gtr:id>9C9B90DD-5A56-4E71-B06F-9E21E8E0E94F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A full project grant application has been submitted to the BBSRC.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54340395c40368.69100045-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Collaboration with Dr Aileen King at King's College London has enabled us to perform allogeneic Islet transplantation for lymph collection to study the lymph draining from kidneys that has received the donor islets.

This was used in an organ transplantation model The immunotoxin directed the toxin to donor cells that are capable of eliciting an immune response. 

When given on the day of transplantation, the immunotoxin was able to prolong the survival of donor kidney grafts in recipients that would otherwise reject the grafts. There was diminished donor-specific antibody formation and delayed rejection of subsequent donor type skin grafts. This strategy can be adopted to be used in the clinic to prolong survival of donor grafts in humans.

In the second part of the project, we used the same immunotoxin to study a specific immunological phenomenon, that of exchange of surface molecules between cells. We have used recipients that are sensitive to killing by the toxin part of the immunotoxin, but they do not express the target molecule that the antibody part of the immunotoxin recognises. Therefore, only recipient cells that have acquired the relevant molecule would be killed. We have successfully demonstrated that this model allows us to deplete this type of cells, and studied the consequences of this. After depletion of recipient cells that have acquired the molecule recognised by the immunotoxin, there was a slight reduction in antibodies produced, but survival of the transplant organs were unaffected. This is a useful tool for highly specific cell depletion and can be used by others in other areas of investigation.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The immunotoxin can be used to prolong survival of donor organs.
