The initial sensing of signals is accomplished by proteins called receptors. For example, the ability to see requires some device within the human body that is sensitive to light and can convert light into a signal that is amenable for processing by the visual system. This is accomplished by proteins that absorb light and convert this absorbance into a chemical reaction. These proteins are therefore termed 'light receptors'. Receptors play a very important part in humans since they are not only required for the recognition of external signals but also for the communication of various body parts with each other. For example, when a person is stressed, its heart will beat faster and its blood pressure will rise. This reaction is caused by the release of a hormone called adrenaline from the brain that binds to receptors in various parts of the body. In the heart, binding of adrenaline to adrenaline receptors generates a signal which ultimately stimulates the heart to beat faster and with more power. These receptors have been studied very extensively, and as a result, a number of drugs has been developed that acts through these receptors. In fact, more than 30% of all drugs bind to these receptors. Some of them act by switching the receptor on, mimicking the action of the endogenous hormone, for example drugs for the treatment of asthma. Other drugs block access of the hormone to the receptor, for example drugs for the treatment of high blood pressure. One can frequently observe that long-term stimulation of a receptor leads initially to a very strong reaction that diminishes over time despite continuing receptor stimulation. For example, continuous stimulation of a heart with adrenaline will initially cause the heart to be faster and with more power, but this stimulation will wear off even though the adrenaline treatment is continued. This effect is termed 'desensitisation'. Desensitisation occurs very frequently in biological systems and is often desirable because it prevents a system from overstimulation. For example, desensitisation enables the eye to adapt to very different light levels: at low light levels, the light receptors in the eye operate at full sensitivity whereas in bright light, they are desensitised and their sensitivity is dramatically reduced. Some people suffer from a rare hereditary disease in which the desensitisation of light receptors is abolished. The affected individuals are blind because their eyes are destroyed by overstimulation. However, sometimes receptor desensitisation can be undesirable, especially when the action of drugs is concerned. It is believed that desensitisation is generally caused by a protein that prevents relaying of the receptor-generated signal. This protein was initially discovered in the eye where it mediates the desensitisation of light receptors. We have recently been able to show binding of this protein to hormone receptors in single living cells. In the proposed study, we want to investigate how the properties of this protein are regulated and how this may affect the desensitisation of receptors. Since receptor desensitisation has a negative impact on drug treatment, a detailed understanding of its mechanisms is of general interest.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>G-protein-coupled receptors comprise the largest receptor family of the human genome, with about 720 genes coding for them. About 30% of all marketed drugs are targeted towards these receptors. After agonist activation, many G-protein-coupled receptors desensitise through a pathway that critically depends on a small protein family called the arrestins. Briefly, these agonist-activated G-protein-coupled receptors are phosphorylated and then the phosphorylated, agonist-occupied receptors gain the capability to bind arrestins. Arrestin binding to receptors leads not only to desensitisation but also to the initiation of signalling pathways involving tyrosine kinases and / pertinent to this project / translocation of the receptor-arrestin complexes to clathrin-coated pits and subsequent internalisation. Some G-protein-coupled receptors show only a quite transient interaction with arrestins at the plasma membrane, while others translocate arrestins to vesicular structures, most probably endosomes. Arrestins can be covalently linked to ubiquitin, and it has been proposed that it is the stability of this linkage which determines whether their association with receptors is only transient or more stable. The many functions of arrestins can be explained by their capabilities to undergo a multitude of protein-protein interactions. Some of these have been studied in living cells using resonance energy transfer technologies. This is particularly true for the interaction between arrestins and G-protein-coupled receptors, which has been studied by both bioluminescence and fluorescence resonance energy transfer of appropriately tagged proteins. The proposed project aims to investigate the interaction between arrestins and either components of clathrin-coated pits or the ubiquitination machinery. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based assays will be developed for measuring the trafficking of receptor-arrestin complexes into clathrin-coated pits and for determining the ubiquitinylation of arrestins. These experiments will be complemented by in vitro affinity measurements employing purified proteins. From this study, we will learn how the transfer of receptor-arrestin complexes into clathrin-coated pits is regulated, and we will gain further insights in the importance of arrestin ubiquitinylation.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder
