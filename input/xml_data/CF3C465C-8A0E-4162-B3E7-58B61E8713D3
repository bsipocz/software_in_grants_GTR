In addition to the direct devastation caused by flooding, recent events have also highlighted the threat that large scale inundation poses to essential utilities and transport infrastructure. Thankfully major problems are relatively rare within the UK, and our infrastructure can cope with the majority of scenarios. However, this situation is changing, partly due to urban creep (increased urbanisation of our societies) but primarily due to the impact of climate change. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts a global temperature rise of between 1.4 and 5.8 degrees centigrade by the end of the century; although the effect of such rises are uncertain and complex, it is generally accepted that they will have wide ranging effects on both precipitation and the equilibrium of major ice sheets (e.g. increased frequency of intense precipitation events and increased sea levels).In response to general climate change predictions, significant research effort is being devoted to the assessment of its impact and the development of suitable mitigating strategies. Within the UK, a number of high profile EPSRC led research programmes continue to investigate how climate change and urbanisation impacts flooding at local, regional and national levels. Chief among these are the major FRMRC/FRMRC2 consortium projects and the interlinked BKCC/SKCC/ARCC initiatives. A significant proportion of such research is concentrated on the effect that the increased frequency and severity of extreme rainfall events will have on our urban environments; this is unsurprising, given that by 2008 the number of people at a high risk from flooding could rise from 1.5 million to 3.5 million, and annual damage from flooding could rise from the present level of 1 billion to about 25 billion. Whilst it is clear that climate change and urban creep are having an ever increasing impact, it is also clear that the public can often be left feeling overwhelmed by the sheer scale of the associated issues; this project hopes to go some way to demystifying these complex issues. The main aim of the proposed project is to develop an interactive exhibition to help explain to the general public how stormwater is managed within urban environments, with particular reference to the adaptations that are necessary to mitigate against the effects of climate change and urban creep. In addition to publicising current EPSRC funded research themes, it is anticipated that this will increase awareness of the built environment professions amongst the young. It is also envisaged that the project will stimulate greater public dialogue around the relevant issues, and an increased appreciation of the role of individuals and local communities. This will be achieved primarily through the use of interactive physical models which will illustrate some aspects of the urban water cycle, and also allow the audience to interact with the urban fabric (i.e. modify and/or replace certain elements in an attempt to reduce the frequency, severity and type of flooding). By associating a realistic cost to each type of system modification, and setting a reasonable budget, the audience will also gain an insight into the resources associated with both traditional, hard engineering , approaches and more innovative, sustainable, techniques. Although the project is aimed primarily at school children, it will be sufficiently flexible to be of interest to older children, adults and those professional bodies with a vested interest in urban flooding.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>131279</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The main aim of the project was to develop an interactive workshop to help explain to the general public how stormwater is managed within urban environments, with particular reference to the adaptations that are necessary to mitigate against the effects of climate change and urban creep.

The developed workshop illustrated some of the key issues around urban flooding, with a particular emphasis on sustainable, local level mitigation measures. The main elements of the workshop were interactive models, incorporating scale models of a urban areas with a river and typical urban infrastructure, i.e. houses, shops, industrial units, roads and parks. The models incorporated sprinklers system to simulate rainfall, with water being fed to the sprinklers and river via a system of pumps. Workshop participants were able to change certain elements of the urban fabric in an attempt to reduce the severity of flooding, e.g. replace tarmac with permeable paving, swap conventional roof surfaces for green roof surfaces, etc.



During the original EPSRC funding phase (2009-2011), the workshop was delivered to both Scottish schools and UK science festivals. In total, some 5000 people participated in the workshop, most of whom were young people. Independent evaluation of the workshop &amp;quot;...yielded strong evidence for the learning that took place during audiences' interaction with the project&amp;quot; including &amp;quot;Learning about flooding, its causes and implications&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Learning about steps that can be taken to mitigate flooding (and that these can be small and simple)&amp;quot;.



The success of this project illustrates how effective such approaches can be in getting across complex societal issues to the general public.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This project was all about public engagement and so all the work was essentially in a non-academic context. The workshop developed continues to be used on behalf of institutional stakeholders (SEPA, Scottish Government, Local Authorities, etc) to help get key flooding related messages across to the general public. It has also been used by consultants to help with related public consultation activities. Although funding for this project finished in 2011, Heriot-Watt University has been working with the Scottish Government and SEPA to deliver the workshop at a range of different events; the Scottish Learning Festival and the Dumfries Environmental Fair being two recent examples. These activities have supported SEPA in their ongoing flood risk awareness raising, and again the feedback has been very positive. The Scottish Government has just awarded Heriot-Watt University &amp;pound;50k to deliver the workshop to up to 50 Scottish schools in 2013/14.



At the same time, the work undertaken has proved to be the inspiration for similar activities, with at least one other workshop being developed along the same lines (see Tweed Forum interactive catchment model).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>FD9BA6DC-D598-4F12-9CF3-2BBDEA092BFD</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-9983413452.2671775142fa</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>As part of this project, two physical models were developed to illustrate some of the key issues around urban flooding.
