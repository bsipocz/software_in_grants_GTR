They are responsible for photosynthesis and convert carbon dioxide into organic living material. These centres of photosynthesis carry out many vital plant functions and are essential for plant productivity and the performance of crops. Chloroplasts are especially interesting because they contain a small but very important set of genes that are very different from the set of genes organised as chromosomes in the nucleus of cells. These genes are essential for chloroplasts to function but were difficult to study until relatively recently. Transplastomics is a new field of research that allows the genes in chloroplasts to be studied directly and will allow improvements to chloroplast genes that enhance plant productivity in a changing environment. These transplastomic studies have shown that chloroplast genes have a number of desirable features. They code for important proteins that are amongst the most abundant proteins found in leaves and they are not spread through pollen. Moreover transplastomic technologies are extremely precise in enabling targeted improvements to chloroplast genes. Transplastomic technologies allow chloroplasts to be used as solar energy convertors which are a carbon efficient and sustainable manufacturing platform for producing useful biomolecules. Genes are made of DNA and they are maintained by molecular machines that replicate and repair them. The genes in chloroplasts are continually damaged by the action of sunlight. Efficient repair and replication is required to maintain functional chloroplast genes. We are studying the molecular machines responsible for maintaining chloroplast genes by removing specific components of the machines and then examining the impact of their removal on the maintenance of chloroplast genes. Our results have identified key components and molecular mechanisms required for maintaining chloroplast genes. Whilst much progress has been made using transplastomic technologies, a current limitation is their efficiencies particularly in important crops such as oil seed rape. In this research we will exploit our knowledge of the gene maintenance machinery in chloroplasts to improve the efficiency of transplastomic methods. This will allow the benefits of transplastomic research to be realised in important crops. This work will also provide new knowledge on the molecular processes that maintain the integrity of chloroplast genes. Because this process is important for plant growth and development it will improve our understanding of a key molecular process required for plant productivity.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Plastids contain a conserved genome that is essential for plant growth &amp;amp; development &amp;amp; is amenable to modification using transplastomic technologies. Precise targeted integration of transgenes, maternal inheritance of plastids &amp;amp; high yield expression of recombinant proteins drive applications of transplastomic plants in agriculture &amp;amp; industry. Conservation of the plastid genetic system means that the basic mechanism of foreign gene integration into plastid genomes is conserved in all plants in which plastid transformation has been established. Plastid genomes are present in multiple copies per plastid, the sequence is uniform within a plant (homoplasmic) &amp;amp; the copy number varies during plant development. Relatively little is known on the plastid DNA maintenance machinery responsible for these features. The DNA replication/recombination/repair (DNA-RRR) proteins involved in maintaining plastid genes are encoded by the nucleus. In this work we will exploit our knowledge of plastid DNA-RRR proteins &amp;amp; pathways to provide approaches to improve the overall efficiency of plastid transformation, which is particularly important for translating applications of transplastomic technologies to crops, which are recalcitrant to plastid transformation. The approaches will be developed in Nicotiana tabacum, the model for transplastomic research, &amp;amp; tested in Brassica napus. We will use inducible vectors to enable transient changes in the levels of native plastid DNA-RRR proteins as well as foreign DNA-RRR proteins. The impact of these changes on plastid genome maintenance, raising the efficiency of plastid transformation &amp;amp; the levels of recombinant protein expression in plastids will be determined. The work has applications in developing new tools for transplastomic technologies &amp;amp; will improve our fundamental understanding of the key processes &amp;amp; components responsible for conferring plastid genome stability, which is essential for chloroplast function &amp;amp; plant growth</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Transplastomic research has considerable commercial applications and the results will benefit: Agribusiness- interested in chloroplast encoded traits Pharma companies- interested in manufacturing high value products in plants This will include small and medium sized enterprises and large multinational companies The plant breeding industry: plastids encode an important set of genes and the tools in the project will allow plant breeders to make changes in the plastid genomes of important crops Staff: These include the PDRA and technician employed on the grant who will gain new expertise and knowledge in an area of fundamental research that has potential commercial applications.

We presented our BBSRC-supported research on maintenance of chloroplast DNA to the public using hands-on interactive touch screen displays. We presented alongside other Plant Science exhibits from the Faculty. Our display was led by EM (Co-I); included four members of the group: Anil Day (PI); PhD students XH, HO; EMA (PhD student). The touch screen technology was supported by experimental material propagated in sealed-containers showing the steps involved in regenerating shoots from in vitro-propagated plants grown on 'jelly'. We also showed some of the striking green-white variegated plants obtained from our research. HO prepared a 10 minute video entitled, 'Meet the Plant Scientists' in the Faculty, which was looped ran throughout the day. The video described the depth of Plant Science Research in Manchester; included interviews with all the PIs. Visitor ages ranged from 6 to 65 yrs. The younger visitors were interested in the touch screen interactive displays pointing out what they knew about the impact of being in the sun on themselves. This was our link to the damaging effects of sunlight on plants. The topics discussed included: the next generation of Biotech crops the GM debate; chloroplast DNA was it different from chromosomes; noise in biological systems; mathematical; computational approaches to reflect a virtual chloroplast; variegation in plants; awareness of women in Plant Science; getting sunburn on holiday because the sun block got washed off when swimming; does the jelly the plants grow on taste nice?. The hands-on help provided by 5 members of our team allowed for multiple overlapping discussions with the public. The public were curious, well informed engaged with the topic of our BBSRC supported programme. Positive Verbal Feedback from the public: i) One of the best exhibitions I have attended with my family at the museum. The 'hands-on' activities were great. When will you be holding the next exhibition?' ii) Both my grand daughter and I really enjoyed the exhibition.

This project made use of our recent identification of key nuclear genes required for maintaining chloroplast genes to manipulate their expression in new ways. This allowed the gene products to be increased or decreased. Chloroplast genome maintenance pathways can be exploited to remove antibiotic resistance genes from crops in order to improve the precision of modern genetic crop technologies. To support this work we developed a non-antibiotic marker system that works in chloroplasts, whose presence or loss is easily monitored. By using our excision assay we identified two gene maintenance pathways in chloroplasts where one pathway affected marker gene excision and the other did not. This is important for understanding both the protein and DNA substrates that promote marker excision to improve the technology. We also found that by altering the amounts of specific chloroplast DNA maintenance proteins present in plants we could influence the number of resistant shoots that could be isolated following chloroplast gene insertion experiments. This is important because a better understanding of the gene insertion process provides us with information on how it can be improved in order to apply transplastomic technologies to a wider range of crops.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings have provided new knowledge on a process that is fundamental to the growth and performance of crops. This better understanding of the influence of key genes influencing plant growth provides the fundamental information required to drive the knowledge-based economy. The knowledge provides evidence-based understanding of a primary process needed for food production and security, which is essential for maintaining the quality of life. The work has been disseminated at local, national and international gatherings to share knowledge and improve understanding, which in turn maximizes societal and cultural impacts. Graduated PhD students benefiting from the research knowledge and skills who have moved to foreign countries are networking organizations and nations. In turn, world leaders in the field have visited Manchester to share knowledge with a wide audience who in turn act as beacons to impart their knowledge to the public. The wider recognition of the expertise developed during this project has improved the toolkit for transplastomic technologies. This has led to projects in development with industry to improve economic competitiveness. Moreover, the expertise developed in the project provides us with niche and specialist skills for the BBSRC Networks in Industrial Biotechnology and Bioenergy.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B60E0E2F-6F58-48E1-A590-94832C38B8B4</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5464004e82acc3.30946170</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>International Advisory board Member for the International Symposia on Chloroplast Genomics and Genetic Engineering</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>278C0265-C5D8-402A-B31A-C43AB09ACB55</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5463cb43838269.80022074</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Technology allowing precise manipulation of plant DNA to exclude marker genes.
