We are trying to understand how different parts of this protein machinery work together. 
Our work is focused on a conserved protein called Mcm10, which connects parts of the DNA replication machinery and is vital for the DNA copying process. We have recently solved the molecular structure of human Mcm10. The structure is a ring formed by six Mcm10 molecules. This gives us a very good idea of how this important protein may connect parts of the DNA copy machinery and DNA at the same time. The structure and a powerful multidisciplinary approach give us an excellent starting platform for molecular and cell biology studies of Mcm10. 
Recent advances show that proteins, which form DNA replication machinery, are attractive targets for the development of new treatments against human disease such as cancer. Understanding the Mcm10?s molecular blueprint and its role in DNA copying process will help in designing novel therapeutic agents, which will selectively target and eliminate cancer cells without damaging normal healthy cells.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The protein machinery controlling DNA replication is a major regulator of cell growth in human tissues and is frequently deregulated in cancer. Initiation of DNA replication is tightly regulated and starts with the ordered assembley of origin recognition complex (ORC), Cdc6, Cdt1 and Mcm2-7 proteins into pre-replicative complexes (preRCs). These preRCs are activated by CDKs and Cdc7/Dbf4 kinase and the loading of Mcm10 protein. The latter event triggers the transition from preRC to pre-initiation complex (preIC) which is followed by the recruitment of Cdc45 and the DNA polymerase-a machinery.
Emerging data point to the existence of a DNA replication initiation checkpoint which monitors the assembly of a critical number of preRCs. When initiation of DNA replication is blocked it results in an apoptotic response in cancer cells and reversible cell cycle arrest in normal cells. This makes preRC formation and the transition to the preIC a promising target for anticancer therapies capable of blocking cellular proliferation without causing genotoxic stress.
The Mcm10 DNA replication initiation factor is a conserved nuclear protein critical for origin activation. During the preRC to preIC transition Mcm10 is vital for origin unwinding and provides a link between the Mcm2-7 replicative helicase and DNA polymerases. The properties of Mcm10 as an integral part of the replication machinery initiation make it an important target for therapeutic intervention. 
We have recently solved the first structure of human Mcm10 by using electron microscopy and image analysis. The Mcm10 molecule is a ring-shaped hexamer. The structure suggests a model of how this protein may serve as a connector between the Mcm2-7 helicase and DNA polymerase. The ring-shaped molecule may serve as a docking platform for assembly of the molecular machinery required for initiation of DNA replication. The structure allows us to predict the areas of DNA binding, major domain boundaries and positions of Zn-fingers potentially involved in DNA binding and/or protein-protein interaction. 
This model gives us the structural background to start molecular and cell biology studies of the Mcm10 structure-function relationship. We now aim to obtain detailed information on functional domains of Mcm10 involved in DNA-binding and protein-protein interaction. The knowledge gained from this project would be invaluable for understanding the molecular mechanisms behind DNA replication initiation. Apart from its fundamental scientific importance, detailed insight into Mcm10 activities will be directly applicable to the development of novel anti-cancer agents targeting the DNA replication initiation machinery thus selectively eliminating cancer cells.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-06-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-03-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>398803</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of York</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Biology</gtr:department><gtr:description>Interaction between Mcm10 and SIRT1 histone deacetylase</gtr:description><gtr:id>7022F580-5D0A-4A14-A70F-7DE591439A97</gtr:id><gtr:impact>this is strategic collaboration with the lab whose expertise is based on cell biology of SIRT1. having collaboration with this lab cut down time for experimental set up tremedously allowing us to focus on elucidating mechanism of SIRT1-dependent regulation of Mcm10</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>nYWkq91dFet-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>siRNA design, antibodies and cell lines from the group with expertise in SIRT1</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>we identified SIRT1 as an interactive partner of Mcm10.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2009-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University College London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Biosciences</gtr:department><gtr:description>Protein-protein interaction between Mcm10 and Mcm2-7</gtr:description><gtr:id>32B02254-A10B-4EBF-9C0E-A84DEEF36B1B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>these collaborations allowed (1) to complete quickly experiments on validation of Mcm10 as a target for drug-design by using DNA combing analyisis (with NCI, NIH).

The information on ongoing projects and research activities within the WIBR labarotories is clear and undesrstandable to general public and is constantly updated.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>37ACA36F0BD</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ucl.ac.uk/wibr</gtr:url><gtr:year>2008,2009,2011,2013,2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Wolfson Institute Brochure  for general public</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A4370AE6-8FC5-4D5A-AEDD-928C34652EE6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Supervised the making of a brochure about the WIBR aimed to general public.

This is a significant tool that allows us now to investigate Mcm10 function in vivo and in vitro. We have generated a large panel of DNA constructs coding for Mcm10 domains and fragments designed for expression in various host systems. They all are tested now and produce stable soluble proteins.</gtr:description><gtr:id>F97BEFE0-9484-4EE5-80CE-8CF1C6CABB8F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We have shared our reagents with a number of collaboration partners in UK to accelerate our joint research. The Mcm10 antibody is unique as the commercial source is expensive and unreliable.
