However, au pairs are not protected by employment law. They have no right to a minimum wage, nor defined maximum working hours nor a right to holidays. The project aims are:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>to investigate the effects of changes to recent UK immigration legislation on the supply of au pairs within the UK&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>to examine the place of au pairing in the life and work trajectories of au pairs&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>to evaluate the subjective experience of au pairs&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>to examine understandings of au pairing within host families? narratives of (good) parenting.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>The project uses four methods: an on-line survey and analysis of existing data to provide an overview of the nature and extent of au pairing in the UK; in-depth interviews with au pairs to explore their experiences; interviews with host families to uncover how au pairing to fits with their identity as parents and interviews with key informants to provide context.&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research has the potential to impact a range of users in the commercial, public and voluntary sectors and to benefit wider publics such as au pairs, migrant domestic workers, their hosts and employers.

The project will produce data on the current operation of au pairing which has the potential to increase the effectiveness of policy and public services. The research will reveal details of au pair and host family practices, expectations and experiences which will cast light on whether the scheme operates as it is assumed to. For example, the project will provide data on the effects of au pairs not being considered 'workers', and whether they are distinguishable from paid domestic workers. It will provide information on the welfare needs of au pairs (for health care, maternity benefits etc) and the extent to which these are met. This knowledge would help policy makers revisit guidance on au pairing to bring the scheme in line with government intentions. Data will also be provided on host family motivations and concerns which are of relevance to policy makers interested in work-life balance and other family policies.

Information gathered by the project will be of use to public and third sector groups who offer support and advice to au pairs and domestic workers. The research will establish common issues faced by au pairs and could inform the extent to which there is a need for more specific support for this group and how support for au pairs is best delivered. Similar information could be used by commercial agencies, such as those who place au pairs, who would benefit from increased clarity regarding the legal definition of au pairing, and the needs of the current au pair and host populations.

The research will benefit wider publics, particularly au pairs, host families, paid domestic workers. The findings will be used to inform those involved in the sector, or thinking of becoming involved, about common problems, best practice, rights and responsibilities. Such information would be of substantial benefit to au pairs and their hosts and could impact their welfare considerably.

The project engagement plan involves rapid dissemination of findings to a range of audiences in order to enhance the impact of the research. (1) The project website will allow for rapid communication in a variety of styles (short and long articles and reports) and interaction with users. It is anticipated that the website will be particularly important for communicating with wider publics and non specialist groups. (2) An advisory group made up of policy makers and members of NGOs will be involved in the project from the outset. They will be sent reports of findings for comment and will act as a conduit to other policy makers and third sector uses. (3) Communication to non-academic users through press releases and news articles. Both Cox and Busch have extensive experience of working with the press (Busch as a journalist for over 10 years) and have good contacts in relevant media such as the BBC and broadsheet newspapers. (4) Production and dissemination of a succinct report which highlights the outcomes of the research of greatest relevance to policy makers and third sector organisations. This will be distributed to a mailing list of appropriate individuals and organisations. It will also be presented at a dissemination event to which academics, policy makers, and third sector organisations will be invited. (5) Dissemination to academic audiences through publication of journal articles, presentations at conferences in the UK and abroad and production of a book.

Professional skills will be developed by the staff throughout the project. Busch will receive training in Nvivo software; Cox and Busch will both receive web site management training. Busch will develop experience of quantitative research, use of survey monkey, analysis of quantitative data and analysis of qualitative data using Nvivo.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>220823</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>IAG Conference Macquarie University, Australia</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6790E707-F05F-4531-911F-60BCFFF83968</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Paper presented in session on dirt, titled 'Dirt, disgust and loathing: The importance of mess at home', this was in the early months of the project and was an opportunity to think through how my existing work on domestic labour and dirt might relate to the current situation and status of au pairs.

In particular the aim was to learn from scholars form the Scandinavian countries about the effects of government schemes to encourage householders to declare domestic employment arrangements. It was clear from my participation how leftfield the UK is in terms of lack of government initiatives to tackle the irregular market in domestic work - or indeed to even really discuss it openly.

The data gathered was directly disseminated to groups who might be interested in the issues raised around childcare and/ or in the welfare of au pairs. The findings were also disseminated to appropriate journalists and reported in the print and broadcast media, thereby reaching a wider audience of potentially interested parties such as parents considering hosting an au pair or au pairs with queries about their status or rights.

The findings have been used by a number of groups to inform their thinking and practice. For example, the researchers worked, and will continue to work with, with the organisation BAAPA (the British Au Pairs Agencies' Association) to identify ways in which to engage with government to clarify the definition of an au pair in the UK. This work is on going but representatives from BAAPA commented that the guidelines on the gov.uk website (https://www.gov.uk/au-pairs-employment-law/au-pairs) were improved immediately following - and by implication in response to - the press coverage of our findings. This is a very important impact as the previous guidance on this website lacked clarity and created loopholes which would have allowed very poor conditions to be within the definition of 'au pairing'. Additionally, we had a productive relationship with the NGO Kalayaan who campaign for the rights of Overseas Domestic Workers (ODWs). The lack of definition of an 'au pair' in UK policy has a knock-on effect to the pay of this group of workers and the findings from the project can be used by this group as part of their wider work to gain clarity and rights for ODWs. Representatives from the Bulgarian and Romanian embassies attended a briefing event to hear about the research findings and commented on their usefulness for their nationals and, following discussion at the event, they also reported plans to liaise with each other in their dealings with problems arising from the mistreatment of au pairs. Representatives of the Low Pay Commission and the Fawcett society reported that they were very interested in the findings for their work and Representatives of the Family and Childcare Trust attended two events reporting the findings from the project and wrote to say that our findings raised 'issues that concern us' and that reference to our research would be included in a forthcoming publication. 

Coverage in the national media meant that a wide audience was able to hear about our research and individuals involved in au pairing such as hosts and au pairs and those considering becoming hosts or au pairs, were impacted. While it is impossible to know very much about such impacts, comments on the media reports - for example through Twitter to Woman's Hour or the 377 comments left on the Guardian article - suggest a substantial interest and concern amongst listeners and readers. Such responses could lead to changes in behaviour such as greater thought being given to the way in which au pairs are treated by hosts (and vice versa), the use of more formal channels to hire au pairs, or host families and au pairs seeking guidance about their rights and responsibilities.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>D57126D1-9C83-4A9E-B704-C9998212C6A4</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>562a026e66e300.38370235</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project has produced significant new knowledge on the effects of the de-regulation of au pairing in the UK. We gathered new quantitative data that shows that despite the end of any official 'au pair scheme' there are many thousands of people living and working in diverse conditions under the name 'au pairs'. Their pay is low, their conditions are often poor and they are almost entirely unprotected despite their very vulnerable position living inside their 'host family's' home. We gathered extensive new qualitative data which shows au pairs are making the balancing of work and family possible for families in the UK. Hosts are rarely motivated by a desire to take part in cultural exchange but are trying to find an affordable way to meet the competing demands of paid work and family life.

The original plan for the project had been to interview 10 key informants, 40 au pairs, 40 host families and to gather quantitative data through an on-line questionnaire of au pairs. However, we found some research paths were closed off and discovered new research resources. Key informant and au pair interviews were carried out successfully and yielded rich data. We discovered that social media were important spaces for au pairs to 'hang out' and meet others in the same situation and we used these spaces to locate interviewees. Host families were much more difficult to locate and much more reluctant to be interviewed. Methods of snow-balling used successfully with au pairs did not work with hosts and some resulted in abusive emails being received. Host families were much more reluctant to discuss their behaviour than au pairs. We were able to carry out 15 interviews with host families who had between them hosted over 50 au pairs. To compensate for the lack of success of the on-line survey and to supplement data on working conditions we carried out analysis of 1000 advertisements for au pairs placed on gumtree.com. This was an incredibly successful approach. We were able to generate quantitative data about average pay and working conditions (hours worked, number of children being cared for, access to own bedroom and bathroom) and to analyse advertisements qualitatively to investigate the language used and topics highlighted by host families looking for au pairs.

Involvement in research led to development of new international networks and contacts. Relationships have been built with researchers studying au pairs and NGOs supporting au pairs in Europe, the USA and Latin America. One outcome of this was the publication of the book 'Au Pairs Lives' in Global Context: Sisters or Servants' (2015: Palgrave) edited by Rosie Cox. Production of an edited collection had not been planned as part of the project but the new networks built made this possible and allowed for our findings from studying the UK to be put in international context. Rosie Cox also joined an international network based at NTNU in Trondheim, Norway which brought together researchers looking at paid domestic labour and citizenship throughout Europe.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The activities outlined in the 'Pathways to Impact' document were used successfully to develop networks and disseminate findings so they can be used by others. For example, research findings are being used by non-academic users the British Au Pairs Agencies Association (BAPAA) and Kalayaan an NGO working with Overseas Domestic Workers (ODWs). We are working with BAPAA to use research outputs to inform government policy on au pairing. We are working with Kalayaan regarding the 'family worker exemption' to National Minimum Wage which affects au pairs and ODWs. A member of Kalayaan wrote a chapter for the edited collection 'Au Pairs' Lives in Global Context' raising awareness of this piece of legislation and findings from the project can be used by Kalayaan in their work. A number of avenues for further academic research arose from the project. We identify the following as particularly worthy of further investigation: 
? The differential treatment of au pairs of different nationalities 
? The construction of reproductive labour as something other than 'real' work and not deserving of 'real' pay within understandings of au pairing. 
? Links to other forms of youth mobility and the migration of highly educated youth into low-waged 'low-skilled' work</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>334944ED-7BD5-4836-B312-1C5E1DC92FE4</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54c68200ab07c7.01695933</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://aupairproject.wordpress.com/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Qualitative interviews with 40 au pairs; 15 families hosting au pairs and 10 key informants recorded and transcribed then coded in Nvivo.</gtr:description><gtr:id>05EFDAC9-4BAD-4643-BFAC-2B9EFAB11417</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Research has been reported in the press and to practitioners / policy makers.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54591d78a03987.25113399</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Au pair, host and key informant interviews</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Data from 1000 advertisements posted on gumtree.com was converted into numeric form and entered on an excel spreadsheet to allow for quantitative analysis.</gtr:description><gtr:id>81D1D44C-689A-46E2-8A45-9A3159D2C53E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This database allowed us to provide numerical data to back up findings from qualitative research.
