This project will examine how well-connected medieval bishops in Britain and Scandinavia were. Effectively, we shall be asking who you needed to know to become a bishop and how the connections gained throughout their lives impacted on their activities as bishops both within their diocese and on the wider international stage. Why did this matter? Bishops were not just religious leaders; they were important men who served kings and other great lords as advisers and even diplomats. They controlled large territories and had significant incomes and people at their command. To be a bishop was to be a leader who might crown kings or foment rebellion. They were also players on an increasingly international stage: the period of study, from 1250 to the Reformation, saw the centralisation of the Church under the Papacy. From the early fourteenth century, candidates for bishoprics usually had to travel to Rome or Avignon in order to be appointed. Yet, at the same time, national or state structures were increasingly important with kings wanting to control who became bishops. The very nature of the international Church meant that such men travelled and had connections well beyond their home countries. That, combined with university education, meant that bishops were key conduits for the transfer of ideas. The key question the project seeks to answer is how internationalised were the bishops in northern Europe. 
 
In order to address this, we will undertake a prosopographical study of the bishops in the following dioceses: Sodor, Dunkeld, Galloway, York, Orkney, the Faroes, Skalholt and Holar in Iceland, Greenland, Bergen, Stavanger, Uppsala and the archdeacons of J&amp;auml;mtland. We will examine the familial, social origins and connections of the bishops and archdeacons. To allow us to consider the pressures of natioal and papal institutions, we have selected dioceses in four Church provinces - York, Scotland, Nidaros and Uppsala - which lay within the four kingdoms of England, Scotland, Norway and Sweden. This selection means we can study core and peripheral dioceses within the same Church province, across Church provinces and across national boundaries. The analysis will seek to answer a number of questions which include: did the bishops have similar social origins which meant they had the right connections to lobby the diocesan patrons or chapter for their promotion? We shall also assess the evidence for our bishops having attended university, and if so, where and whether they achieved a degree and the implications of this. Were there particular dioceses with higher levels of university attendance? Can we find evidence of either direct or indirect international contact as a result of university attendance?

The project will then assess whether the bishops, once appointed, were able to introduce new ideas and reforms in their dioceses. They attended international Church councils which agreed policies that the bishops were then expected to introduce in their own dioceses. We will examine whether they were able to enforce rules like clerical celibacy and the payment of tithes. The dioceses in question might be seen as remote from Rome and the centres of Christendom, but they were not necessarily isolated from ideas developed at the supposed 'core'. 

The PI and CoI are leading specialists in the history of the Church in Scandinavia and northern Britain. The PI will examine bishops in Scotland, England and Norway whilst the CoI will study bishops and archdeacons in Sweden. The PhD student will examine bishops in Norway and the North Atlantic. The project will present new ways of studying medieval bishops and their actions across national and ecclesiastical boundaries. This study of bishops will help us to understand the Church and society in later medieval northern Europe.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>There are three distinct groups of beneficiaries: the general public, school pupils and cultural organisations such as museums. The project will enhance cultural enrichment by expanding these groups' knowledge and interest in medieval bishops. 

The general public includes societies which support research into Norwegian-Scottish cultural links such as the Scottish Society for Northern Studies and the Norwegian-Scottish Association. These societies are composed of both academics and interested amateurs. We will develop links with local history societies in the relevant dioceses; for example, the Islands Book Trust, which promotes the history and culture of the Scottish Islands, and the Isle of Man Natural History and Antiquarian Society which promotes Manx local history among the general public. The project team will give talks to these societies and will write short pieces to advertise the project in their newsletters.
 The majority of people will only have encountered Sodor as an imaginary island on which the children's stories Thomas the Tank Engine are set. In publicising the ongoing project and results, we will show them the right track. We could present the study of bishops' career paths in the Middle Ages within the context of the modern media fascination with the appointment of senior ecclesiastical figures within, for example, the Church of England or the Papacy. It is clear that even in the modern world, a cleric's background, education and subsequent career still influences their chances of promotion. We will also seek to emphasise the importance of the Church and bishops to medieval society. In the context of the current debate on the Scottish independence referendum, the Wars of Independence (1296 to 1357) have particular resonance. The role of the Church and especially bishops is a key topic and one which we can draw upon. Some of our bishops were involved in the diplomacy during the Wars of Independence and at least one was imprisoned by the English. The project will also throw light on the relationships between medieval Scotland, England and Norway. This is very topical given the current political interest in Norway and the debate about British and Scottish identity; Scottish-English relationships are characterised as antagonistic. This cross state and diocesan study will aim to present fresh evidence that this was not always the case. The project will communicate with the general public through free lectures, press releases, newspaper and popular history magazine articles and will have a project blog. 
The second group of beneficiaries are school pupils. The project team will undertake school visits to talk about the project and we will also encourage school groups to visit the university. These talks could either be a general introduction to the project and the themes or a more specific focus on a particular bishop. We have already agreed to give a lecture and run a workshop for the Higher History pupils at Aboyne Academy in Aberdeenshire. Thus, for example, we will talk to 5th and 6th Year pupils studying either Higher or Advanced Higher History options on the Wars of Independence, 1286-1328. Topics relevant to these options will include the role of the bishops in the succession crisis of 1286 to 1296 and the Great Cause, episcopal activities during the Wars and episcopal involvement in the Declaration of Arbroath. 
The third group of beneficiaries is museums and other cultural bodies which maintain sites relevant to this project. The bodies include Manx National Heritage, the National Museums Scotland, Historic Scotland, the Archbishop's Palace Museum and the Medieval museumin Trondheim and the Historical Museum in Oslo. For example, the project will be able to set Peel Castle, which was the medieval cathedral of the diocese of Sodor, in its wider ecclesiastical context by showing visitors the links between the bishops of this site, Norway, Scotland and England, something which is not currently done.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-10-06</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-11-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>186484</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Bishops' careers blog</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>163148A9-D0FF-4A32-AAD1-E30D1EA5E780</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The blog post about the diocese of Dunkeld was promoted on Facebook.

One of the key findings from our research on the Scottish bishops of Dunkeld, Galloway and Sodor is that royal service was not an essential criteria in order to become a bishop in the later Middle Ages. This is a startling contrast with England where at the same time, two thirds of English bishops had built their careers in royal service. For Dunkeld and Galloway, it is really only in the mid-fifteenth century that we see anything similar. Otherwise, successful candidates for a bishopric tended to have experience in the administration of a diocese, usually in the cathedral chapter. Another key finding is that it is rare in both Scotland and Norway to have bishops who belonged to the higher nobility, that is were the sons of titled men like earls. Instead, the majority were the sons of untitled nobles or of unidentified, possibly lesser, origins. Those bishops did belong to the higher nobility tended to achieve promotion to their first bishopric at a younger age. Typically they were around 30, the minmum age for bishops.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings might be used by other academics to study other groups of high ranking ecclesiastics to understand more fully how the medieval Church recruited its top echelons. It also might be used by others to inform museum displays.
