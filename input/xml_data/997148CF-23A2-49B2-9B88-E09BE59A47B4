This project proposes the modelling and the experimental characterisation of a novel wickless heat transfer device applicable both on the ground and in space. The name Hybrid Heat Pipe (HyHP) comes from the fact that the well-established loop thermosyphon (TS) is here transformed to a plain serpentine device with one evaporator for each turn, as a pulsating heat pipe (PHP). 
Why do we need a new wickless heat device? Two-phase heat transfer devices play an important role in a variety of engineering fields; TSs, for example, are already successfully implemented in nuclear and solar plants, while heat pipe applications range from electronics cooling to the automotive sector. But the actual systems have two major problems: 1) dissipation of high thermal powers maintaining high heat fluxes has significant limits connected to the upscale of the internal wick and the system dimensions, 2) the deployability or the flexibility of the passive two-phase systems is quite reduced. 
How does HyHP work? The vertical operation in gravity, as well as the distinctive location of the heating and the cooling sections, causes the fluid to circulate regularly in a preferential direction guaranteeing stable operation and homogeneous temperature distribution of the system. The combination between channel dimension and working fluid is chosen in such a way that the device will operate in thermosyphon mode on the ground and, in the case of weightless conditions, in capillary mode, i.e the liquid completely fills the tube section and therefore vapour expansion and contraction cause an oscillation of the liquid/vapour patterns.
Why do we need a new project on HyHP? Because, although in 2014 a first HyHP prototype was built and the first ground and microgravity experiments were successfully carried out, we are far from understanding all the physical phenomena inside a HyHP and our ability to simulate the processes involved is still quite limited, i.e. we are not able to design a HyHP to manage heat within given boundary conditions.
Numerical analyses are fundamental to understanding the possible advantages and drawbacks of the HyHP and to predict its performance. The development and the use of innovative numerical tools and theoretical approaches will provide an insight into the physical phenomena and the governing mechanisms of a HyHP, opening the route to more efficient and customised design.
These numerical studies will be supported by parallel extensive experimental campaigns. A prototype with an Infrared (IR) and Visible Spectrum (VIS) window will be designed, built, equipped with several sensors and tested both on the ground and in micro-gravity conditions. ESA has already offered us partial funding and access to the parabolic flight campaigns.
It is expected that the primary beneficiary of this research will be the space industry; however advantages are not confined to this specific field, as the support of two ground-based companies indicates. Since the novel design of HyHPs combines technological aspects from both TSs and PHPs, the numerical tools we develop will be relevant to all industries concerned with thermal management. The investigation will benefit the scientific and industrial sectors by providing an open-source CFD tool for the simulation of general phase-change heat transfer phenomena.
Finally the project is contributing to the growing of the new Advanced Engineering Centre of the University of Brighton, which starts with a initial investment of &amp;pound;14M with the aim of delivering world leading research in the sectors of Internal Combustion Engines, Thermal Efficiency and System Efficiency, and Thermal Management for Ground and Space Applications.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our HyHP project focuses on two-phase passive thermal devices, such as Thermosyphons, a known technology already used in nuclear and geothermal plants, solar concentration power plants and computer cooling, and Pulsating Heat Pipes, which are an emerging and promising technology, due to manufacturing simplicity, low cost and the capability to be used in flexible systems.
The main project beneficiaries are the UK manufacturing sector working in the field of Heat Exchangers, Heat Pipes and Thermal Management; the UK Space Sector, since advanced design and simulation skills will be available for the thermal systems of satellites and space missions; the UK scientific communities working in the fields of Engineering and Physics; and the University of Brighton, since this will be its first project in this particular field, which will finally transfer longstanding, high-level, multidisciplinary and internationally recognised research from Italy to the UK.
Worldwide the Heat Exchanger Market will be worth &amp;pound;16B by 2019. Within this, Europe has always been a major producer (30% globally) of heat exchangers, since it includes most of the global leaders in heat exchanger manufacturing. The Heat Pipe Market is only a niche, nevertheless it already had a value of more than &amp;pound;0.6B in 2009, demonstrating faster growth with respect to other thermal control devices. This growth is driven by the needs to manage higher heat fluxes, dissipated in new ultra-high density electronic components and in high-power LEDs. The Space Sector is presently booming with many new private actors sharing a market opportunity of 5B&amp;pound; in 2020, which has been estimated to grow to &amp;pound;40B and 100,000 new jobs by 2030 by the Editor of Works Management and Engineering Careers, Max Gosney. The challenge for the private industry is to build sophisticated small satellites (micro- and nano- satellites) at low costs using innovative solutions. In addition business is growing around so-called &amp;quot;space tourism&amp;quot; and subtal flights. The thermal management of satellites represents about 15% of manufacturers' business. It is therefore expected that the new technologies of two-phase thermal systems for space applications and high power thermal control on the ground may have a value of more than &amp;pound;1B by 2020. 
The UK has a major role in the commercialisation and development of heat pipe technology, since three of the 10 major companies in Europe producing heat pipes, loop heat pipes, vapour chambers and thermosyphons are UK-based. The project will also convince such companies that the University of Brighton may be a key partner for heat pipe technology.
The capability to design these systems is of enormous importance for their technological advancements. Since the design of our HyHP combines technological aspects of both TS and PHP, there are many aspects to consider in order to evaluate the great impact of HyHP on the beneficiaries: (1) the proposed advanced numerical tools will be very important for all the Industries related to fluid systems using two-phase flows, (2) specifically the numerical tools will contribute to the design of pulsating heat pipes and bring the technology closer to market implementation, (3) better understanding of the effect of gravity on such systems will also open their use for terrestrial application, such as in the automotive sector, (4) the participation of UK scientists in the ESA Physical Science Unit will generate new skills and network opportunities, (5) HyHP is building basic competencies which lead to innovation of thermal components in the public and private sector for the space industry.
Finally, HyHP results from a specific scientific context, and has produced excellent research for the last 7 years, with journal papers and worldwide recognition. There is a real possibility of implementing a Hybrid Heat Pipe on the International Space Station, which will provide an imaginative means for wider dissemination of science to the greater public.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>722093</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4ECFF22F-40DE-42D3-97EB-0493D61E0045</gtr:id><gtr:title>Simulation of micro-flow dynamics at low capillary numbers using adaptive interface compression</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Computers &amp; Fluids</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7ccd4809f7b7b037f7d1cddf07d9fe19"><gtr:id>7ccd4809f7b7b037f7d1cddf07d9fe19</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Aboukhedr M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5aa8f8cc25c155.64776843</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P013112/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>772CD758-53CD-407F-9B2C-F2B861E86155</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>35</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mechanical Engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>99E0B904-CAB5-4511-AFB3-AA6D2B171F97</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Process engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>53CC8ACD-11A0-48ED-8743-F66E9A657C12</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Fluid Dynamics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>93295214-E29B-49B2-AA54-09445C36CAF2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>35</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Heat &amp; Mass Transfer</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
