Oriel Science is a public-facing exhibition and outreach space showcasing the University's STEM research. Our vision is to continue hosting rolling, thematic, science-based exhibitions aimed at our two target audiences: school students and the wider public. Alongside the gallery, Oriel Science will house a workshop offering a schools programme in parallel with each exhibition. We create accessible, informative and interactive exhibitions focused on the work and collaborations of the University's STEM community. We take visitors on a visceral journey through a scientific theme, ignite their curiosity to explore that theme, and leave a lasting legacy in their imagination. We will encourage younger visitors to choose STEM subjects at school leading to STEM degrees in University and further develop the scientific literacy of older visitors.

Oriel Science launched on 10th September 2016 at the end of the British Science Festival which was hosted by Swansea University. We are open to the public every weekend and also during the October half-term where we held a range of special activities and workshops designed for school-aged students. We average 2,000 visitors per month (excluding half-term) and have had significant media coverage.

Our first exhibition is based on the theme of &amp;quot;Time&amp;quot; and features 16 exhibits including the STFC LHC Roadshow, a range of particle physics detectors (a cloud chamber, Geiger counter, MX-10 detector and muon observatory) illustrating that sub-atomic particle decay after a very short TIME. We have an audio visual animation of time dilation near black holes, an immersive experience showing a time lapse video of the southern stars with a sound track taken from the Voyager spacecraft. A 30 metre &amp;quot;time wall&amp;quot; has an animation of the history of the Universe from the Big Bang. The public is welcomed to the venue by a &amp;quot;Back to the Future&amp;quot; DeLorean and a Tardis &amp;quot;time machine&amp;quot; enticingly situated to be visible from the outside.

We are now planning our second themed exhibition, &amp;quot;Image&amp;quot;, and this application seeks funding for an STFC footprint in this venture. There are many obvious STFC-related exhibits related to this theme: astronomical, particle and nuclear physics, intense light sources, etc. The &amp;quot;Image&amp;quot; exhibition therefore represents a fantastic opportunity to engage visitors with STFC Science so that their understanding and appreciation of this science and technology is developed.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We will disseminate information about our exhibitions using the Swansea University Press Office, using our excellent relationships with the local press.

We have already begun detailed discussions with Swansea Council regarding a long-term multi-million pound home for Oriel Science in their redevelopment space along the waterfront, and we have the Council's full support for our project. This relationship will allow us to use the Council's extensive communication network to further advertise our work to the public.

Through our &amp;quot;Welsh Teachers to CERN&amp;quot; programme, we have excellent contacts with the Education Department in Wales which links us to Science teachers across the country. In addition, Swansea Physics has a long-standing and highly popular MasterClasses and Christmas Lecture programmes. These are over-subscribed and the schools who have been involved will form the natural early-adopters of Oriel Science.

Swansea University's S4 project also has long-standing relationships with schools in Communities First areas who would be very keen to expand the range of activities that could be provided to their students.

Our colleagues in the Computer Science Department run Technocamps, which is an IT-based outreach programme funded to reach every high school in Wales, and we will build on their knowledge to develop our own network of schools.

We will share best practice with members of the Association of Science and Discovery Centres and utilise our links with STEMNET Wales to advertise Oriel Science.

We already have links with the IOP's Lab-in-a-Lorry and have entered into a two-way discussion about designing a possible particle physics experiment for them.

Wales's National Science Academy is also a supporter of Oriel Science and will be keen to ensure we gain good coverage across the country.

In addition, we will obviously use the STFC Press Office and our colleagues and contacts in other UK Physics Departments to enlarge the footprint where Oriel Science is known and to share best practice.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-02-28</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>9262</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/P006035/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
