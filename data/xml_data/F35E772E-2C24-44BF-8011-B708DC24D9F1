Continental Europe, Lloyd's and Bermuda.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Phase 1 compared face-to-face and electronic reinsurance trading practices in the Lloyd's and Bermuda markets. This Phase 2 study addresses the key reinsurers in Continental Europe separately in order to reflect their unique and dominant characteristics in shaping the industry. It advances knowledge generated from Phase 1 in three important ways:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;ol>
 

 &lt;li>The inclusion of Europe produces a global dataset covering the three main reinsurance markets that betifveen them account for 94 per cent of global market share.&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>European data enables coverage of different types of trading practices, because in contrast to Lloyd's and Bermuda, European reinsurance buying is mostly 'direct, that is, without intermediation from a broker.The comparison of direct and mediated trading is an important addition to the comparison of electronic and face-to-face forms of mediated - trading in the first study.&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>The Lloyd's and Bermuda markets are both part of an Anglo-American cultural context. The addition of continental Europe illuminates potential cultural influences on risk evaluation.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ol>

This work has increased awareness of critical trends and signalled the potential dangers of systemic risk to an industry with a critical economic and social role. We have extended the understanding of financial markets by further developing its social perspective. Looking beyond economic assumptions of risk traders as rational individuals inhabiting markets, we explored the social interpretations that construct markets. Hence, we have generated new insights into the way people, their activities and tools, interact in the construction and collective interpretation of markets. 

Based on our research findings, we have produced an integrated suite of strategy tools and frameworks to support strategic positioning, relationship management and risk analysis and trading in the global reinsurance industry. We have facilitated the implementation of these tools and frameworks through tailored reports to firms worldwide, commissioned company-specific strategy workshops, targeted distribution of our industry reports, invited presentations at prestigious industry events, articles in the media, a free access website that includes research findings material, and training activities for reinsurance professionals.

The scope and importance of the research impact was been highly recognized through the award of the inaugural ESRC's Outstanding Impact on Business Prize in 2013. The impact has been supported through high-profile engagement at both the (a) organizational level by producing customized reports for participating organizations and delivering strategy or training workshops, and (b) industry-level by producing industry focused reports, covering key issues in several media outlets and presenting key findings at numerous high-profile industry events.

The impact of incorporating our research findings and implementing our models has been felt within companies, as demonstrated in feedback we received from many of them. Companies used our research findings to explain their management approaches and objectives and incorporated frameworks and models that we have developed to improve their organization processes. 

There has also been endorsement of our research findings by high-profile industry bodies and leading players as an impetus for industry change. The premier professional organisation in the insurance industry, the Chartered Insurance Institute, endorsed our reports, frameworks and calls for change to the degree of awarding accreditation credits for insurance and reinsurance professionals attending our research-related lectures and making the associated material available to their global membership. They thus incentivized the use of our materials in industry training and development. Further, a group of leading insurers, reinsurers and brokers from key markets supported a series of training and development workshops based on our strategy tools, specifically targeted at developing the strategic thinking of senior professionals, and attended by a selected group of future industry leaders.</gtr:description><gtr:id>5B25AF16-3C08-4945-B35C-56CF63CA0131</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>545c1327f1f8e5.66787006</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>New theoretical insights from our research have addresses the socio-materiality of risk taking and the social construction of financial markets. Scientific impact of this project was connected to this being the first study of its kind: an ethnographic study of the reinsurance industry with an unprecedented access and dataset. This phase of the broader project involved the collection and analysis of: 231 field note documents of separate observations, 303 interviews, and over 250 secondary documents. 

Our socio-materiality perspective on financial risk-taking focuses on the minute interactions between individuals and the technologies by which they render complex and highly uncertain risks 'real' and amenable to statistical analysis and/or personal judgement. This is a new perspective and generated new insights into the roles of analysis, judgement and technology in financial risk-taking. Theoretically, these findings contribute to the nascent understanding of socio-materiality in the strategy-as-practice literature. Our findings have helped raise awareness of the importance of social-materiality to SAP research. 

By extending analyses of socio-material dynamics to the market, we developed a deeper understanding of financial markets and market enactment Looking beyond economic assumptions of risk traders as rational individuals, we explore how micro-level interactions, social cues and collective interpretations construct markets. Rather than treating markets as discrete from the micro-level efforts of individuals, we generate new insights into the way people, their activities and tools, interact in the construction and collective interpretation of markets. Specifically, this allows us to: a) generate a more socialized understanding of how financial markets operate through the collective interpretation of market cues; b) produce client-relationship management frameworks that are both theoretically novel and practically actionable.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>There have been two main communities who have been impacted by this research thus far. The first is the strategy as practice community. This project and its findings are helping drive the social-materiality research agenda within this field. Examples include the special- themed conference stream at leading European Group for Organization Studies conference on social-materiality convened by Professor Jarzabkowski. Professor Jarzabkowski has drawn from her existing professional networks as a founder of the Strategy-as-Practice community in order to impact this field of research based on her findings, which are novel in their empirical (reinsurance and risk assessment) and theoretical focus (social-materiality and calculative practices) for this community. 

The second main community that has been impacted is those within the field of sociology of finance and economic sociology. Professor Jarzabkowski has had the opportunity to engage in discussion and debate with some of the leading academics in the field of economic sociology such as Professor Richard Swedberg, and those in Science and Technology Studies, such as Professor Trevor Pinch, both at Cornell University, as well as to present and discuss her work with other management researchers interested in markets construction within financial sectors, such as Dr Daniel Beunza from the LSE, and Professor Yuval Millo, Leicester University. She is increasingly developing the impact of the research in these fields, for example through a CARR seminar at LSE, and a Global Finance Initiative seminar at Cornell, with the aim of furthering insight into the novel market dynamics of the reinsurance industry. 

Economic and societal impact has resided in the models developed for the reinsurance industry. This integrated suite of tools includes: blending technical and contextual judgement to enhance risk evaluation; managing client relationships; strategic positioning of reinsurers; strategic group analysis of changes in reinsurance buying; techniques for improving value between stakeholders; and potential systemic dangers of complex globally-connected risks. 

One specific example was highlighting the potential systemic risk arising from a recent trend to bundle reinsurance risks into complex global financial products. We advocated contextual judgement and cautioned about the seduction of complex models. These insights into risk evaluation have been adopted in firms, informed industry debates and increased individual awareness. The topic has been the focus of much discussion in the industry media and commentary and industry has requested presentations to help snowball change.

Client management tools have also had evident impact. These have been widely adopted by firms. For example, several firms have implemented client segmentation strategies that promote a efficient approach to managing value in client relationships. For example one participant noted they secured a new client worth 5 million to them using the model. 

The effect of these findings in prompting industry change is also demonstrated in their public endorsement and championing by industry. Companies have used the findings at industry conferences on better risk evaluation and to communicate the changing nature of risk assessment. Additionally, industry presentations related to the research are widely regarded as provocative and relevant, the media noting 'Paula Jarzabkowski does not like to mince her words' about necessary change. 

Finally, capacity-building impact is evidenced through in-depth organizational workshops, professional accreditation for attending our presentations and a planned workshop series for industry.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>49E1100E-CF60-4814-8FFC-2C248F2ACFF8</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5459ff0649d629.84378040</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Financial Services, and
