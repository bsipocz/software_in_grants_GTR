The major implications of this work are in the academic domain, however it also has the potential of generating impact in the clinical, industry and arts spheres.


(1) Sensitivity to patterning is a fundamental aspect of listening. Understanding the range of sound patterns to which listeners are particularly sensitive, and the neural signature corresponding to their detection, will inform work efforts in all aspects of auditory-related technologies. This including the design of hearing aids and of brain-computer interfaces and any technology that produces sound for the purpose of conveying information, providing feedback or creating ambience. Understanding sensitivity to sound patterns could inform the design of these systems for example by programming them so that they produce events that listeners are particularly sensitive to. This could benefit individuals and the commercial private sector. 

(2) Our results could also find an interesting outlet in the arts field including sound-scape design and composition. 


(3) Our experimental paradigms, designed to study acoustic pattern processing in the normal (healthy) brain may be used to understand and characterize deficits in clinical populations (e.g. 'Auditory processing disorder', Schizophrenia) which exhibit deficits in complex sensory processing. This will benefit individuals, health professionals as well as NHS policy makers.


(4) Analysis tools developed in the course of this project might be of use to brain-machine applications thus benefiting government agencies, and the commercial private sector.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>489505</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/P003745/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>48D25546-6ADF-479A-8877-478CCDB1DC1F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Animal Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F439A20B-A9B0-4A68-B703-7F6AE7570E39</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Systems neuroscience</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
