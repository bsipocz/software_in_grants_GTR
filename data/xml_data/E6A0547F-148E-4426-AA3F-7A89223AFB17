He invented the infinitesimal analogue of the notion of a group: the notion of a Lie algebra. In fact there is a class of groups to which we can canonically associate such a Lie algebra, these are called Lie groups. Basically, these are groups endowed with the structure of a differentiable manifold which is compatible with the group structure. If one replaces &amp;quot;differentiable manifold&amp;quot; by &amp;quot;algebraic variety&amp;quot;, then one obtains the notion of an algebraic group. This notion makes sense over an algebraically closed field of arbitrary characteristic.
 Lie theory can be described as the area of mathematics which studies Lie groups, algebraic groups, Lie algebras and their actions. These actions reveal something of the structure of the acting Lie algebra, Lie group or algebraic group, but also something of the structure of the object on which they act. In the latter case one can say that the action is a mathematically precise way to take the symmetry of the object into account.
 Lie theory has established itself as one of the most central branches of mathematics with strong links to mathematical physics, differential equations, representation theory, ring theory, algebraic and differential geometry, combinatorics and number theory. It is a very active area of research to which many big mathematicians have contributed.

 This proposal focuses on certain problems concerning actions of reductive groups, mainly over fields of prime characteristic (that is what the word &amp;quot;modular&amp;quot; in the title refers to). Reductive groups are a very important class of algebraic groups. They have been classified by means of root systems. The most basic example which is also very important in this proposal is the general linear group GL_n which consists of the invertible nxn matrices.
 Modular Lie theory has its own intrinsic beauty, but is also important because of its relation with ordinary Lie theory via reduction mod p. Several results in characteristic 0 are proved via reduction mod p. It is also worth noting that fields of prime characteristic have important applications in coding theory and cryptography and that they are easier for the computer to handle. One of the biggest problems in modular Lie theory is Lusztig's Conjecture which predicts what the irreducible constituents are of the linear actions of reductive groups. There are many other related fundamental problems, some of which are addressed in the proposal. 
 One of the main ideas of the proposal is that in the presence of problems like Lusztig's Conjecture many related typical characteristic p phenomena should be studied, especially the most elementary ones. In the proposed research I plan to investigate three problems which should give new insights in the the geometry and invariant theory and also in the representation theory of reductive groups in prime characteristic.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research would have academic impact in several ways.
Firstly, it would provide a completely new approach to the modular representation theory of the general linear group GL_n. This would also strengthen the area of representation theory and invariant theory in the UK and it would lead to new research projects in which post-docs and PhD students can be involved.
Secondly, it would help to establish area of spherical varieties in the UK which is at the moment under-represented.
Thirdly, it would lead to interesting combinatorial results.

 I now mention further academic impact of the proposed research. The results from Problem 2, which are essentially about highly regular subspaces of certain finite vector spaces, have the potential to lead to new developments in discrete mathematics, Coding Theory and Cryptography. These research areas are of vital importance for secure data communication. The representation theory of Lie groups plays an important role in mathematical physics, so new results from Problem 2 on the adjoint representation are of potential interest to mathematical physcicists.

 Since Problems 2 and 3 are very elementary I expect that results on these problems should be accessible and of potential interest to a very big group of mathematicians.

 As not directly academic impact I mention that, due to the elementary nature of most of the problems in the proposal, the proposed research will help to make undergraduates and PhD students enthusiastic about algebra and Lie theory in particular. Here I do not just focus on students that want to continue in science, but I also include students who want to pursue a career outside academia. Algebra has many applications outside pure maths, e.g. in coding theory, cryptography, discrete mathematics, physics and engineering. It is my intention to promote and strengthen these applications, for example by supervising students working on interdisciplinary projects.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-10-16</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-17</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>93256</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>I have achieved my goals concerning the problem of highest weight vectors and the problem of spherical varieties in characteristic p. This has resulted in a paper accepted by Mathematische Zeitschrift, and two submitted preprints.
I haven't yet made progress with the third problem concerning the centre of the restricted enveloping algebra of gl_n.
The problem concerning highest weight vectors certainly leads to another problem that I am also working on: highest weight vectors in the exterior algebra of Mat_n.
The latter may relate to Lie super algebras.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>They may be used by other pure mathematicians who will read the preprints or the papers once they are published.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4D1457DB-53C7-4B41-A6AD-21A839CBCCA4</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56debb5e0ce599.14843824</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www1.maths.leeds.ac.uk/~pmtrt/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AB7510F8-0F95-4AEF-9DCA-DE491C97903C</gtr:id><gtr:title>HIGHEST WEIGHT VECTORS AND TRANSMUTATION</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Transformation Groups</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/1c2d1e6687b0089814802d29d596f37b"><gtr:id>1c2d1e6687b0089814802d29d596f37b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>TANGE R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5aa3f6fe600671.50936855</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>DB66A3BC-D372-4F65-8496-AAAAD5F79F59</gtr:id><gtr:title>Embeddings of spherical homogeneous spaces in characteristic p</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Mathematische Zeitschrift</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/bbe633c92a27150996eca6d9c6107d45"><gtr:id>bbe633c92a27150996eca6d9c6107d45</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rudolf Tange</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>58b73d1c0e5de5.81287147</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/L013037/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>27F853CB-FB22-4B9D-82D7-542648D097F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Algebra &amp; Geometry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
