Previous research by the applicants suggests there are four broad types of burial practices: complete horse, human-horse and horse element inhumations, and cremations. Horse burials have been summarised within other research, but very little work has addressed the phenomenon directly or analysed what these traditions can tell us about the development of associated cultures in Britain. The project also aims to effectively disseminate the research outcomes to the public within a short space of time, by collaborating with museums, visitor centres and a renowned historical novelist.\n\nThe horse is a symbol of prestige, power and warfare in many cultures and its domestication had profound effects on the development of human culture. Some of the oldest indications of human ritual in Britain include horse material. Horse burials or deposits are found in the Iron Age and Romano-British period in Britain. During the Anglo-Saxon period, these depositions are joined by a new practice in Britain, the prestigious human-horse burial rite. This mortuary tradition is associated with Anglo-Saxon warrior culture and Germanic origins and is often considered primarily an East Anglian practice. This research will test those beliefs and more closely examine some of the spectacular warrior-horse burials at Lakenheath and Sutton Hoo. An unusual unaccompanied Anglo-Saxon period woman-horse burial at Sedgeford will also be investigated. Woman-horse inhumations are especially rare, with other examples primarily in Scandinavia. This burial appears to be the only example currently known in Britain. A comparison of British horse burial practices with other European examples will help us understand the development and origins of these burial practices, particularly the relatively late occurring human-horse funerary tradition.\n\nThe first millennium AD was a period of significant changes in Europe, seeing the rise of new polities and social upheavals which included varying degrees of population movement and cultural change. English culture has been considered the result of post-Roman Germanic invasion. There are clear cultural connections with Europe during this period, but there is also significant evidence that this interaction has occurred over a number of millennia. Current research suggests that English identity can no longer be clearly attributed to a large population replacement. An understanding of the development of horse burial practices, particularly horse-human mortuary rites, can provide important evidence about cultural change in Britain during this period.\n\nThis research will target horse burials in England and analyse their composition, distribution and possible cultural interpretations within a European context via a review of the historical, ethnographic and archaeological literature. This will be coupled with a detailed bioarchaeological analysis of a set of burials from sites exhibiting a variety of practices. The emphasis here will be on horse-human inhumations and recreating their life stories using bioarchaeological and forensics-derived methods. These include osteological and chemical analyses of the bone assemblages to provide biographical information such as stature, health, trauma, diet, and activity. This research will yield new information about the horse in Anglo-Saxon society, the origins and mobility of a select set of people and horses, and the development of ritual practices and beliefs during this important period of English cultural development. The project research and public dissemination aspects will work closely together, developing a method of targeted, wide dissemination of new research.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Academic journals and conferences are important areas for the publication of research results, providing for knowledgeable review and discussion of the findings. However, this type of publication rarely has much impact on the general population or even other areas of academia such as history and anthropology. Traditionally, public uptake of either the data or changes in historical or social theory based on archaeological research has lagged decades behind academic publication. Therefore, a significant portion of this project will be dedicated to exploring the best methods and media for making not only the results of this project exciting to both adult and juvenile audiences but also showing how such projects can engage interest in the study of archaeology, science and history.\n\nAll partners, the University of Bradford, the National Trust (NT), the Sutton Hoo Society (SHS), the Museum of London (MoL) and historical author Bernard Cornwell, are committed to increasing public interest in and enjoyment of the results of archaeological research. The primary non-academic output of this research will be the creation of a public exhibition.\nAspects of the exhibition being discussed include:\n\n Gallery exhibit of mixed text and artefact presentation;\n Public seminars/workshops (Sutton Hoo Visitor Centre, schools, and/or other venues) presenting and discussing aspects of the research findings and how they can inform stories about the past;\n Story competition based on workshops and an information pack - judges to include Bernard Cornwell;\n Themed workshop/seminar aimed at showing how archaeology, science and history are combined to work out what happened at one of the burials. Emphasising what we can and what we can't know from such research. \n Travelling exhibit - 'what the bones tell us' - short presentation and hands-on at local museums/schools.\n\nThe diversity and scale of the exhibition is somewhat dependent on funding available. The SHS will consider additional funding applications for the project. Some of the funding will be in the form of in-kind from the NT and MoL. As learning and presenting public exhibition/dissemination is an integral part of the project, the primary presentation and some of the resource material production will be done by the student, hence not incurring additional expense. In addition to museum work, the student has already initiated contacts with local schools in West Yorkshire, and done one trial 'what the bones tell us' presentation which was very well received by students and school. \n\nDuring 2009-2010, the student was able to progress the profile of this project by presenting aspects of the research at two prestigious international conferences: the 2010 European Association of Archaeologists (EAA) conference in Den Haag, Netherlands, Body Manipulation and Burial Tradition session (www.e-a-a.org/; http://www.eaa2010.nl/) and the 2010 International Council of ArchaeoZoology (ICAZ) in Paris, France, the Animal in Funerary Practices session (http://www.alexandriaarchive.org/icaz/). Both presentations are scheduled for publication. The student's first presentation, the 2009 EAA conference, which won best student presentation, is scheduled for publication in the next edition (v13) of the European Journal of Archaeology. \n\nThe collaboration with the National Trust (80,000 visitors to Sutton Hoo per year), Museum of London (375,000 visitors in 2005/6) and best selling novelist Bernard Cornwell (whose books, including an Anglo-Saxon series, are regularly translated into twenty languages) means that the results of this research will potentially reach many thousands of adults and children in the UK and beyond.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>54250</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I02481X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
