This proposal is focussed on validating the use of cheap state of the art CMOS pixel sensors in nuclear and particle physics applications. CMOS is an industry standard technology used by large chip manufactures such as Intel, and by using state of the art commercial technology in scientific applications we aim to change the way that many particle detectors are made. Implications of this would include a reduction in cost of future particle and nuclear physics experiments by replacing traditionally more expensive devices with the significantly cheaper CMOS technology. In order to do this we need to characterise existing devices in terms of their response to radiation, and also determine the operational limits, i.e. how much radiation we can expose the devices to before the fail.

This proposal also has a number of specialist application tests in order to understand the operational envelop of these devices in terms of temperature and magnetic field. The limits to which one can reduce a silicon sensor to a thin film for sensing applications will also be explored to follow up on preliminary feasibility studies that have already been completed successfully. Thin film devices could revolutionise the design and performance of low mass tracking devices where that is a requirement for specialist scientific applications.

In terms of impact and innovation, we also aim to demonstrate the ability to deposit thin film coatings to sensors so that one can tailor make a device to respond to different energy radiation (soft or hard X-rays, UV light and so on). Such devices would have imaging applications in astronomy, medicine and other industries. UV sensitive devices operating at low temperatures would also be of special interest for future neutrino experiments that are in the very early planning stages (T2K upgrade).

By the end of this proposal period we aim to have characterised the operation limits of these sensors in terms of radiation hardness, temperature and magnetic field environments, and to have designed a viable chip that can be used as a prototype for a real world experiment. Taking us a step closer to cheaper large-scale silicon based scientific instruments with higher performance. At the same time we will have a much clearer understanding of the limits of this technology for commercial and scientific applications beyond the remit of the particle and nuclear physics applications that are the core motivation for this research.

The research we are doing should help reduce the capital cost of investment in future experimental activities that could be built using CMOS MAPS as a cheaper and better performing alternative to traditional technologies. In a nutshell this proposal is an investment into doing more science better and cheaper in the future.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>See summary from lead institute.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-06-21</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-03-22</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>9197</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Switzerland, Swiss Confederation</gtr:country><gtr:department>ALICE Collaboration</gtr:department><gtr:description>ALICE</gtr:description><gtr:id>BF91907F-A324-4B9F-A1EA-D54476D125A2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Outputs are primarily through publications, listed in the relevant section of the form, which are the outcomes of collaborative research.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>MbfqaViJLRF-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Access to an accelerator facility - the Large Hadron Collider.
