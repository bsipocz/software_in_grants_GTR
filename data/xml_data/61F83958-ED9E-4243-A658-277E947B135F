Consider the set N of natural numbers: 0, 1,2,3,... Two natural numbers could be added, but they cannot always be subtracted: 1-2 is not a natural number. We say that N forms a monoid; it is commutative because a sum of two natural numbers does not depend on the order in which they are added. 

It is useful to have an algebraic structure that accommodates subtraction as well as addition; this is how the set of integers Z is constructed out of natural numbers; essentially, negatives are simply added to the existing elements. We say that Z is a (still commutative) group and it is a group completion of the monoid N.

There are other similar examples: consider Z with the operation of multiplication (rather than addition as above). Again, it is a commutative monoid and its completion is the set Q of rational numbers.

Note that in the last example Z supports two structures: addition and multiplication, suitably compatible. A formalization of this is called a (commutative) ring. On the other hand, Q is more than a ring: it is a field, which means that all non-zero element of it are invertible. The field Q is called the field of fractions of Z, because its elements could indeed be viewed as fraction with integer numerator and denominator.

Group completions of monoids and fields of fractions of rings are examples of localization. In the present project we concentrate on localization of rings, or or more general structures called differential graded rings. 

Given a commutative ring A and a collection S of elements in A one can try to formally invert it, or localise at S. For example, the localization of Z at the set of all non-zero integers produces Q. This is one of the most fundamental and simple procedures in commutative algebra; it serves as an underpinning of advanced fields of pure mathematics, such as algebraic geometry, and is indispensable as a tool for proving theorems. Commutative localisation has been well understood for a long time.

In contrast, our understanding of localization of noncommutative rings (such as a ring of square matrces) is more patchy; various useful constructions, such as forming a field of fractions, are either impossible or only hold under severe constraints. On the other hand, noncommutative localization is very important, for example it could be said that the whole subject of homotopy theory (the study of those properties of spaces which do not change under continuous deformation) revolves around localization of a certain category (which is a generalization of a noncommutative algebra).

The main insight of the present project, which builds on a recent work by the proposers, is that once the category of noncommutative rings is suitably extended, the formal properties of commutative localization are almost completely restored.

The goal of the present project is to exploit the consequences of this idea, extend it suitably and derive consequences in algebra, topology and category theory.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The impact of the proposed research will be felt inside the academic community only, at least in the short to medium term. Because of the foundational nature of the project, there is a relatively clear field for research, with many exciting new problems which would not be considered interesting or approachable before. Some of the problems were set out in the proposal, as they were a natural continuation of the previous work by the proposers, but it is expected that as work progresses, many more will naturaly emerge and we hope that they will taken up by other researchers in neighbouring fields. In particular, we hope that derived localization could serve as a basis for developing noncommutatve algebraic geometry and will help tackle problems of interest to wide variety of researchers, particularly those working with module spaces of various kind.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>317340</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Working in collaboration with Prof Chuang (City University), I developed a conceptual approach to Homological Perturbation Theory by introducing a differential graded bialgebra that governs perturbations of differentials on chain complexes supplied with a certain additional algebraic structure, called `abstract Hodge decomposition'. The bialgebra in questions is given by very few generators and relations, yet it exhibits an unexpectedly structure, well deserving of further study. We give a conceptual proof of a strong version of the Homological Perturbation Lemma and develop some applications to strong homotopy algebras. A preprint entitled `On the perturbation algebra' has been submitted to the arXiv.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The approach developed in the paper mentioned above could be useful in providing explicit formulas for deformations of algebraic and geometric structures and as such, could be of interest to experts in deformation theory.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>1CAD04E6-643E-4EBE-8461-5FD79B2B3C8B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c98470e48a57.25410553</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8BBC24EF-5BD2-4DB4-8035-B10F817268A6</gtr:id><gtr:title>Arxiv preprint</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f93f4d35c4901ae984e3e4a78c6c45a8"><gtr:id>f93f4d35c4901ae984e3e4a78c6c45a8</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>chuang j</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c98592b47117.08302778</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/N015452/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>27F853CB-FB22-4B9D-82D7-542648D097F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Algebra &amp; Geometry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
