These solution sets are called algebraic varieties, and are viewed as geometric locuses, generalising the circle and hyperbola of analytic geometry. Algebraic geometry is a mature subject, and the geometric points of view and the extensive toolbox it provides for studying varieties apply to a great many problem in mathematics and its applications.Algebraic curves occur as the locus f(x,y)=0 in the plane, where f is a polynomial function of x and y; in low degree (conics and cubics) one gets useful conclusions by explicit manipulations of the equation, but as the degree of f increases, the kind of conclusions one hopes for are more abstract, and necessarily involve more theoretical machinery. One eventually learns to stop worrying that the points of the curve are not parametrised in terms of anything more elementary, and to accept the curve as a primary object of nature, possibly complicated, but to be understood in its own terms and used in subsequent constructions.Rather than the degree, a better invariant of an algebraic curve is its genus, that is, the number of handles (donut-like holes) in its topological model. Especially important is the case division between the three cases g=0 (a sphere) or g=1 (a donut) or g&amp;gt;=2 (a surface with many handles); the case g=1 gives the elliptic curves, that played a key role in Wiles' proof of Fermat's last theorem. For algebraic curves or Riemann surfaces, this trichotomy was clearly perceived already in the 19th century, together with its interpretation in terms of positively curved, flat, or hyperbolic non-Euclidean geometry; the picture of the three cases g=0 or g=1 or g&amp;gt;=2 serves as an icon for the whole subject.The same trichotomy was a distant model for Mori theory or the classification of higher dimensional varieties, one of the most intensively developed area of algebraic geometry from the late 1970s; this work led to Mori's 1990 Fields medal. This classification is at present the subject of a major breakthrough, with the recent announcement of the proof of the minimal model program in all dimensions. The first component of the Warwick symposium will develop and disseminate these new result, and exploit its many applications.Algebraic varieties, the solution sets of simultaneous polynomial equations, provide examples and techniques in number theory and in theoretical physics, in algebra and singularity theory and in other branches of geometry. Even in analysis, which mostly deals in infinite dimensional spaces, the ultimate aim is frequently a reduction to a finite dimensional solution set modelled on algebraic geometry. The Warwick symposium will include components on each of these topics, together with applications of algebraic geometry to other areas of mathematics.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-08-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-08-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>164568</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>UK-Japan Winter School: Algebraic and Symplectic Geometry</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6C24D05C-CEF3-43FA-A900-3F7BF8F81F68</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Mon 7th-Fri 11th Jan 2008 UK-Japan Winter School: Algebraic and

parameter spaces

Week 1

Mon 3rd-Fri 7th Sep
&amp;quot;Explicit construction of moduli and parameter spaces&amp;quot;
Lecturers: Alastair Craw (Glasgow) and Diane Maclagan (Warwick)

The school is organised in collaboration with the long-running Polish September school, with Buczynski, Langer and Wisniewski as coorganisers.
The plan is to have 2 lecture courses accessible to beginning graduate students in algebraic geometry, together with problem sessions and ample time for discussion. There will be room for a number of invited lectures or contributions from participants.

Overview:

These lectures are intended as an introduction to some of the ways that moduli problems arise in algebraic geometry, with strong emphasis on explicit descriptions of the resulting spaces.

One place where such problems arise is when one is interested in a family of geometric objects, such as subschemes of a projective variety.
By restricting to objects satisfying a numerical condition, like Hilbert polynomial of a subscheme, one may obtain a moduli space of such objects. One can then expect to improve one's understanding of the objects by studying geometric or topological properties of the moduli space itself, including dimension, connectedness and the structure of its irreducible components.

For a second situation, imagine that one is interested in geometric or topological properties of a given scheme. In this case, it may be possible to introduce a moduli problem for which the underlying moduli space is the scheme in question and, moreover, where the tautological family on the moduli space gives insight into properties of the space.
For instance, if the tautological family defines a collection of vector bundles on the scheme, do the classes of these bundles freely generate the Grothendieck group of vector bundles, say, or even the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves?

model program

Conference: Higher dimensional minimal model program (HD MMP) Wed 12th--Thu 20th Dec 2007 Organised by Corti, McKernan and Reid

The subject dates back to work of Mori, Kawamata, Reid, Shokurov and others in the late 1970s, but has seen tremendous progress since the 1990s; it formed a major component of our Newton Institute program in 2002, and is the subject of the forthcoming book of Corti and others.
This work culminates in the recent announcement in results of [Birkar, Cascini, Hacon, McKernan] of the completion of important components of the (log) minimal model program in all dimensions. We intend to devote the first component of WAG07-08 to the developments and dissemination of these results, which by then should have matured. The solution to this long-standing series of conjectures opens up new research directions within Mori theory, as well as having many potential implications for existing problems of higher dimensional algebraic geometry, singularity theory and Diophantine geometry. This is a rich field of fruit ripe for the picking.

instructional workshop

The themes will include

1. Explicit Mori theory of 3-folds

2. Criteria for finite generation of graded and multigraded algebra

3. The biregular and birational geometry of Fano varieties

4. Introductory topics in Shokurov's approach to HD MMP and the recent breakthrough of [BCHM]

5. Other topics

The workshop aims to give a first presentation of some of the ideas behind the minimal model program for 3-folds and higher dimensional varieties, in a way designed to be accessible to starting graduate students. The intention is to set up a base camp by introducing the general HD MMP, on which there have been major recent breakthroughs. We also plan regular seminars at Warwick on these topics during the term, and a further introductory workshop over the weekend Thu 1st--Mon 5th Nov to mount a more concerted attack on this material, in preparation for the major research conference Wed 12th--Thu 20th Dec 2007.

Prerequisites. Some familiarity with basic algebraic and arithmetic geometry is assumed, at the level of the first two chapters of Silverman's book &amp;quot;Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves&amp;quot;.

Preliminary Reading. Participants may find it helpful to work through the first few chapters of &amp;quot;Chapters on Algebraic Surfaces&amp;quot; by Miles Reid (available online). Preliminary reading on group cohomology will also be useful, a good reference is chapter 2 of Milne's notes on Class Field Theory.

geometry and mirror symmetry

The themes will include

1. Understanding mirror symmetry via affine structures on manifolds

2. Tropical geometry and its relations to enumerative geometry

3. Mirror symmetry for Fano manifolds

4. Homological mirror symmetry

5. Other topics: Open Gromov-Witten invariants, cluster varieties, ...

The workshop aims to explain unifying themes underyling recent ideas that are becoming prevalent in the study of mirror symmetry, based around the idea that mirror pairs are controlled by an underlying real affine manifold. This has shown up in various guises: in the work of Gross/Siebert and Kontsevich/Soibelman exploring the B-side of mirror symmetry; in the work of Mikhalkin, Nishinou/Siebert, Gathmann/Markwig and others on enumerative aspects of tropical geometry, in work of Abouzaid on homological mirror symmetry for toric varieties, and so on.
The intention is to explain some of these ideas in an elementary fashion, accessible to graduate students, as well as to have some more advanced research talks.

Organised by Miles Reid and Katrin Wendland

Spring school
March 24 - 29, 2008
The geometric properties of spaces of topological quantum field theories, their origin in mathematics and their impact in string theory are the broad topics of this school. In particular, the meaning, applications, and generalisations of the tt* equations and the holomorphic anomaly equations will be taught. We aim at a graduate and nonspecialist audience with some basic knowledge in algebraic geometry and topological field theory or string theory. The school will consist of at least four lecture courses, comprised of about three lectures each.

Speakers: Boris Dubrovin (SISSA), Claus Hertling (Mannheim), Marcos Mari&amp;ntilde;o (University of Geneva), Johannes Walcher (Zurich).

field theories

The conference will be devoted to recent developments in the study of the geometry and integrability of topological QFT and string theory. The spectrum of ideas we will explore range from the physics of string theory, topological QFT, the formalism of tt* equations and their classical limits, to mathematical rigorous notions such as Dubrovin's Frobenius structures on manifolds and Hertling's TERP structures.
Furthermore, the current developments on extending these structures to open strings, to manifolds with prescribed submanifolds and bundles, the so-called D-branes, will be a focus of the conference.

organisers: Jean-Louis Colliot-Th&amp;eacute;l&amp;egrave;ne, Samir Siksek, Alexei Skorobogatov, Michael Stoll

Background: Suppose X is a curve defined over Q with X(Q) non-empty.
Then it known that X(Q) is either parametrizable or a finitely-generated abelian group or a finite set according to whether the genus of X is 0, 1, or at least 2. This is an example of how geometry determines arithmetic.

Yet, there is still no algorithm, which given a curve X of genus at least 1, is guaranteed to determine whether X(Q) is non-empty. Moreover, even if X(Q) is non-empty, there is no known algorithm guaranteed to determine the basis of the Mordell-Weil group in genus 1, or the set itself in genus 2. Despite this seemingly bleak outlook, the last few years have seen the development and refinement of many viable strategies, which although not guaranteed to answer these questions in each instance, are likely to be successful in doing so.

For varieties of higher dimension, much less is known about how the geometry determines the arithmetic, although this has become a subject of intensive research. Here experimentation is likely to provide conjectural partial answers to this fundamental question.

Aims: We bring together many leading experts in the subject and aim to give them an opportunity to present their latest results and insights.
To create a situation that leads to fruitful exchange, the participants include both people working on the theoretical side of the subject, and those working on the explicit or experimental side. Through this we hope to achieve a better understanding of the current state of the art and to provide the basis for animated discussions. More importantly, we aim to identify and explore the most promising directions for future work.

Format: The conference will start on Monday morning and finish on Friday at about midday. There will be at most four lectures per day, to give the participants enough time for discussions and collaborations.
