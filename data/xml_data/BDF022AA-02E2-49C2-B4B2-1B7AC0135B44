In 2008 significant changes were made to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act (1990) that regulates the provision of infertility treatment. These included reform of the child welfare assessment that, under s.13(5) of the Act, clinics have a duty to perform before offering regulated treatments. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>This reform was followed by a new Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) Code of Practice, providing guidance on how to interpret the new law. A new welfare of the child assessment regime is thus in place. On the basis of original empirical research this project aims to assess the impact of the amendment of this provision. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>Our exploration will rely on a detailed analysis of the published documentation which accompanied this reform process, and a series of semi-structured interviews at around one quarter of licensed clinics, which will explore the views of clinicians, clinic counsellors and nursing staff. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project aims to provide a unique assessment of the operation in practice of the revised welfare assessment, and to disseminate findings to:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>research users&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>academics&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>treatment providers&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>patients seeking or receiving treatment&lt;/li>

In particular, continued suspicion of single women patients amongst some clinic staff clearly cuts against the grain of the intention of the architects of the recent reform. The widespread, entirely erroneous belief that counselling is legally mandated in certain circumstances identified by the study has become a topic for discussion in other research and among research users.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>34F0BE3C-8E91-4F6B-8A7C-7490C91A588D</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54525e078f73b8.24686462</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1. Changes to the law, and more especially to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority's Code of Practice (COP) giving guidance on how to take into account the 'welfare of the child' in clinics, constitute a shift to a more liberalised approach to regulation.
2. The HFEA's new 'risk assessment' process is generally perceived by staff to be an improvement on previous procedures, although despite the time spent discussing the welfare of the child (WOC) clause during the reform process, the new law appears to have had a relatively limited impact on clinics' previous practice.
3. The number of prospective patients deemed to raise 'welfare of the child concerns' remains small; very few indeed are subject to further investigation and even fewer are denied treatment.
4. Staff report struggling to work out how to resolve the small number of 'difficult cases' they experience.
5. Staff report variations in, and some concerns about, the role and place of counsellors and counselling in WOC assessments.
6. A low number of formal WOC cases co-exists with widespread concern about the 'welfare of the child'. This concern was expressed in the following three main ways:

- A bifurcation in attitudes towards lesbian patients, and single female patients, was detected by the research; lesbian couples were represented often as 'ideal patients', while concerns were expressed about single women's motivations for having a child, their ability materially to support a child, and the strength of their support networks of family and friends;

- The patient group most frequently discussed as requiring different treatment was donor gamete recipients and the view seemed to prevail that the law requires these patients to be treated differently;

- A view that the vast majority of patients are 'normal' co-exists with a sense that 'you can never know' or 'you can never prove it'; the spectre of the paedophile shapes perceptions, as a person hardly ever encountered but whose threat nevertheless creates a powerful rationale for pre-emptive action.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings of the study are being disseminated to the sector. As well as the event we held (see above) we have been asked to write about findings for the Journal of Fertility Counselling, and the specially produced summary will be distrubuted widely in its electronic and and copy forms. See: http://blogs.kent.ac.uk/parentingculturestudies/files/2012/06/Summary_Assessing-Child-Welfare-final.pdf It was noted at the dissemination meeting held about the event in September 2012 that this study provides the first proper look at this area of assisted conception treatment in the present context, and can and should be used to inform those working in the sector about issues to think about. Our dissemination work will continue over the coming months.
