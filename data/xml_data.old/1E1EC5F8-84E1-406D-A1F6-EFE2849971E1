This research is transformative because it rethinks the position of whistleblowers in society, perceiving them as a group that is deserving of effective support. Whistleblowers perform a vital role in society, alerting the public to financial fraud, abuse in institutions and potential environmental disasters. We need these individuals, and recent research shows that 80% of people in the UK believe they too would speak up if they witnessed serious corruption. Even so, many whistleblowers are forced to leave their organisations as a result of their actions and struggle to make ends meet. Whistleblowers and their families tend to live with financial precarity for the rest of their lives. What can be done about this? 

Given their social importance it is surprising that so little is known about how whistleblowers who leave their organisation, survive post-disclosure. This question is particularly pertinent as statistically, whistleblowers who go public will never work in their chosen industry or sector again (Rothschild &amp;amp; Miethe, 1999) due to stigmatisation and resulting bias at the recruitment phase. While legislation exists that prevents such discrimination, research shows that it is often ineffective. Compounding the problem, whistleblowers tend to be relatively senior in their organisation and more likely to have a family to support. People who speak out in this way do so at great risk to their livelihoods and those of their dependents. Even so, hundreds of thousands of employees have disclosed wrongdoing and seen their disclosure escalate into the public domain. How do these people survive, financially and personally? What can be done to assist?

The proposed project will answer these questions by examining the impacts of whistleblowing on those who leave their organisation, focusing for example on stress and mental health implications, and also on financial costs to do with earnings lost and legal fees. Based on these findings, we will explore interventions that can help existing and future whistleblowers by providing advice on income generation opportunities and career management, among other issues. We will trial these via a novel post-disclosure 'career rebuilding' workshop, and with the help of research participants, assess the potential impact of this for people's post-disclosure survival. The research will be designed, executed and disseminated with the help and feedback of existing whistleblowers, and partners in whistleblower advocacy groups in the UK, US and Ireland, arranged via the proposers' current connections with these groups.

In addition to these practical impacts, we will explore new theoretical framings for understanding the role of the whistleblower in society. Through a lens that focuses on the precarious nature of whistleblowing, we examine the importance of material supports and symbolic recognition that are upheld by wider society, if whistleblowers are to continue to bring wrongdoing to light.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will impact on the following groups of people:

Existing whistleblowers who struggle to survive: This group will learn skills for post-disclosure survival and rebuilding, leading to improvement in their livelihoods and those of their dependents. This will be achieved through a trial 'career rebuilding' workshop to which whistleblowers will be invited, along with research reports disseminated through whistleblower advocacy groups (Whistleblowers UK, Public Concern at Work, Government Accountability Project U.S., Transparency International Ireland), public media and support networks, and an invitation to an end-of-project campus tour in London. Longer-term, this group will benefit from a societal shift in perspectives on whistleblowing, involving greater understanding of the material and symbolic supports required. They will also benefit indirectly from the following two impacts.

Managers in key support organisations who are tasked with receiving disclosures from whistleblowers: Organisations include regulatory groups (UK's Financial Conduct Authority, Financial Ombudsman, Ireland's Central Bank), trades unions (including UK's UNITE and Ireland's IBOA) and whistleblower advocacy groups (as above). These organisations often struggle to find appropriate responses, and to our knowledge have few resources that focus on post-disclosure survival strategies. We will engage with each of these groups and present the outcome of our project: a 'career rebuilding workshop' template that can be re-used by such organisations. In addition we will gather their responses for feeding back into our research.

Policy-makers and public representatives: This group will be better informed about the topical issue of compensating whistleblowers post-disclosure, as our project will provide insights into the actual material costs of speaking up. In addition this group will gain a better understanding of the lived experiences of whistleblowers under particular legal frameworks such as the UK's PIDA. These impacts will be achieved through presentations to relevant groups (Financial Conduct Authority, Financial Ombudsman, Public Concern at Work, and relevant Parliamentary Select Committees), arranged via contacts in these organizations, and advisory group members. Key policy makers will be invited to an end-of-project workshop.

Employees who have witnessed wrongdoing and are considering speaking out: Such individuals are often fearful of doing so, given that little is known about the consequences. There is a great deal of media 'hype' around the retaliation experienced by whistleblowers, the loss to earnings and the devastation to one's personal life that can result. With empirically-based information on the actual results of whistleblowing, both financially and personally, employees will be able to make decisions that will lead to better-informed, effective disclosures and a less precarious position for the would-be whistleblower. We will achieve this impact via radio and TV interviews and newspaper articles (arranged via journalists at the BBC, The Financial Times, The Conversation and The Guardian) along with an innovative trial whistleblower 'campus tour' in London, inviting participants of the research to speak to members of the public (modelled on the successful Tour developed by Government Accountability Project).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-09-08</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>195144</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N007085/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4FE4E471-D6BD-451C-B7BE-F13520DD3883</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Organisational Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E7A58901-77B0-4F9E-8784-604D48D233C7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sustainability Management</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
