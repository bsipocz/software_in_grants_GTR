Developing out of the close working relationship between Buckley, the Principal Supervisor, the Shipley Art Gallery, and the practical ceramics knowledge of the third supervisor, Dr Andrew Livingstone (Sunderland University), the project, academically located within the history of ceramics, takes as its focus the patronage and collecting of Henry Rothschild, founder, in 1946, of art gallery and shop, Primavera. In particular, the project considers how the experience of emigration shaped Rothschild's approach and asks if Rothschild brought a 'transnational' sensibility to crafts in Britain as he exhibited and sold crafts from around the world (e.g. Mexico, Peru, and Nigeria). Thus, the project is framed by the trans-cultural interconnections between those exiles and &amp;eacute;migr&amp;eacute;s who found themselves in Britain by necessity or choice from the mid 1930s. Based at the recently opened Henry Rothschild Study centre (HRSC) at the Shipley Art Gallery - home to Rothschild's outstanding collection of approximately 330 pots and the Primavera Archive - the student will pursue three key aims and objectives:\n\nFirst, via a comprehensive literature review and analysis of key periodicals and magazines, the student will develop an extensive genealogy of &amp;eacute;migr&amp;eacute; Henry Rothschild's activities as both a collector and patron of ceramics, fleshing out in so doing Rothschild's distinctive modus operandi in the context of broader trajectories of the collecting and patronage of crafts in Britain in the post-war period. This will be further situated in relation to those broader academic literatures concerned with transnationalism and &amp;eacute;migr&amp;eacute; cultures, not least with regard to their sustenance of visual and material culture in Britain. \n\nThe detailed chronology this generaied with a programme of interviews with Rothschild's associates and contemporaries, will contextualise Primavera as both a business enterprise and creative entity, allowing, secondly, for a critical engagement with both the Primavera Archive and the many fine examples of studio ceramics presently held in the in the Shipley's HSRC. Working in tandem, the student, together with his/her supervisory team, will embed this knowledge within the Centre as a crucial resource with which to both establish and develop the HSRC as a leading centre of knowledge and scholarship on post-war ceramics in Britain; and to foreground the unique contribution of &amp;eacute;migr&amp;eacute; patrons such as Rothschild to post-war crafts. \n\nThird, the chosen student, working with the curators, will develop models for the dissemination and interpretation of the research appropriate to the HRSC and the gallery. These include a series of changing displays within the HRSC; the development of new information panels and labels; supplementary material relating to the collection's provenance, dissemination and circulation for Tyne and Wear Museum's Art Online project; and the organisation (in collaboration with supervisors and curators) of a variety of events aimed at different audiences (local, regional, national and international).\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Focusing on collecting and patronage as an aspect of the history of ceramics, this project promises to open up not only a rich seam of academic writing, but a similarly wide and varied suite of opportunities for non-academic dissemination and impact-generating activity. \n\nFirst, and at a time of much uncertainty in the museums and galleries sector, the project will expose Gateshead's outstanding collection of ceramics and contemporary craft objects to a national and international audience. In particular, with the launch of the Henry Rothschild Study Centre in February 2010 - a key objective of which is to provide new opportunities to collaborate and build partnerships with institutions of higher education - the potential for showcasing the Shipley's collections and intent to a potentially international audience of curators, critics, commissioners and collectors is significant. The project will also situate the Gallery and its collections centre stage at a time when a wider refurbishment of major national collections - including those of the Victoria and Albert Museum - is underway. \n\nSecond, by showcasing the influence of transnational, diasporic and &amp;eacute;migr&amp;eacute; peoples on the production, exhibition and collecting of such world-class ceramics after 1945, the project will throw further light upon the complicated phenomenon of British identity and the importance of visual and material culture in shaping this. For these reasons in particular, the student, working in partnership with representatives from the partner organisation, will refine a set of models for the dissemination and interpretation of the research appropriate to the HRSC. A series of display items from the HRSC, for example, will be 'curated' by the student in partnership with the non-academic supervisor; and these will provide a hub around which additional reach-out activities will gather. Even at this early stage, for example, we expect aspects of the research to be disseminated via practical sessionst the HRSC with school children, community groups and the Friends of the HSRC. Project findings will also be disseminated via regular 'news' postings on the Shipley website, interpretative panels, catalogue contributions and presentations at conferences . \n\nThird, this distinctive collaboration between university and art gallery represents a useful model for how academic research can re-frame display items, fashioning in so doing new readings and interpretations, while also developing a unique dialogue and engagement between elite objects on the one hand and local indigenous and transient populations on the other. \n\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-10-03</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-04</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>54250</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I024852/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
