Indeed, 1820 was arguably the most testing year of the century after Waterloo as a whole. This is the principal subject of this research. A close reading on the existing historical literature relating to the period indicates that our understanding of the importance of this pivotalyear has long been fractured by an over-emphasis on particular episodes and themes. The constitutional crisis wrought by the Queen Caroline affair is prominent (arguably, over-prominent) here; and so too is the continuing issue of post-war economic and social dislocation, primarily evidenced in the repercussions of the 'Peterloo Massacre' the previous August (when troops forcibly dispersed a political demonstration), the prosecution of the charismatic radical leader Henry Hunt and the exposure of the intentions of the Cato Street conspirators to assassinate the cabinet. Yet, other episodes during 1820 have been neglected. These include the endurance of loyalty to monarchy and parliamentary government; the general election occasioned by the death of George III; the return to the gold standard after the crisis-led financial policies of the war and post-war years; the rapid development of pressure group politics through the Central Agricultural Association (a more-innovative body than it has been given credit for); the first stirrings of the free-trade movement that would loom so large in domestic politics two decades later; and evidence for an 'Easter rising' in West Yorkshire and south-west central Scotland. \n\nThis project will therefore endeavour to examine 1820 as free as is practically possible from the distorting lense of hindsight. The key aim is to produce a fully rounded account and analysis of the events across the United Kingdom during this momentous year, focussing on the themes of economic, social and political disorder and the achievement of continuing social and political stability. \n\nTo achieve this the project will draw on a very wide range of contemporary materials, much of it in unpublished manuscript collections in archives across the country, especially the British Library and National Archives (London), the National Library of Scotland (Edinburgh), the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland (Belfast) and the National Archives of Ireland (Dublin). The library of my own insitution, the University of Leeds, is very well-resourced in contemporary published material, while extensive use will be made of recently available digitised newspaper sources. Much of this research will have been completed in the six months leading up to the period to which this application relates, and which will primarily be ised for reflection and writing. \n\nThe research will published in a book, provisionally titled '1820: Disorder and Stability in the United Kingdom'.\n\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The nature and extent of the impact of this research beyond higher education is difficult to capture in advance. However, I have a sustained and extensive track record of engagement with the public understanding of the past. I maintain a steady dialogue with local and family historians, in a form of knowledge exchange which benefits all our work. I deliver public lectures, advise various bodies with historical and/or civic responsibilities, and routinely provide information in response to media enquiries. \n\nThe culture, literature and architecture of Regency England, and the colourful personal life of the Prince of Wales, both as Regent and subsequently as monarch, have a particular appeal to the popular imagination. As part of its wider dissemination plans, this project will seek to stimulate a more-informed public understanding of King George IV in the year of his accession. This will be done through journalistic outputs, with the support of the University of Leeds Press Office. Leeds is also close to the epicentre of significant violent unrest among English industrial workers at Easter, 1820, and opportunities will energetically be pursued to publicise findings from this research through lectures to, and articles for the journals of, local historical societies (with many of which I enjoy good relations as a member and/or through my earlier academic career as a lecturer specialising in local and regional history for the University's continuing education and lifelong programmes). The societies to be targeted include: Huddersfield, Keighley &amp;amp; District, Marsden and the Thoresby [the local history society for Leeds]. \n\nAspects of this research closely relating to print culture will feed through into the activities of the proposed new Centre for the History of Print at the University of Leeds which has an ambitious impact agenda. Provisionally I have in mind a seminar or conference paper in which a comparative study is offered of two popular loyalist and radical oppositional periodicals, the scurrilous and misogynistic John Bull and the scurrilous and muck-raking Real John Bull. As well as the basis for a scholarly article or chapter, this will be reconstituted into a general-interest article for submission to the BBC History or History Today magazines. \n\nThis research will have some impact in schools, especially among AS and A2 teachers and their pupils who are following syllabuses relating to Britain in the 19th century (for example the AQA 'Britain, 1815-65' unit which is explicitly linked to the question 'how successful were Britain's rulers in maintaining their power in this period?'. I already speak regularly to schools and events for teachers (for example the Specialist Schools Trust). \n\nThe wide and varied impact achieved by my previous AHRC-funded research constitutes good grounds for optimism about the current project. Dissemination of this earlier research has included public lectures as diverse as the National Portrait Gallery's lunchtime programme, to the Friends of Kensal Green Cemetery, the Thomas Paine Society (The Paine Memorial Lecture for 2008) and 'London Socialist Historians'. The complete index of proper names appearing in my monograph Chartism: A New History (necessarily pruned by the publisher on cost grounds) is a popular feature of the family history website Chartist Ancestors (http://www.chartists.net/) accompanied by a panel reviewing the book and its merits for a general readership. Less glamorously, but no less importantly, I speak regularly at events for local history societies and other organisations (for example a Black History day-school for the Barnsley Ethnic Minority Initiative). Popular media work on Chartism has included articles in History Today (October 2007), BBC Who Do You Think You Are? Magazine (Spring 2008) and BBC History Magazine (September 2009) and a contribution to a BBC</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-05-23</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-01-24</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>37478</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Politics and performance in 1820</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5C9F54C0-453A-40A9-88BC-0B47689F2A6F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Paper presented to a HEI research seminar on the commentary on domestic politics evident in British theatre during 1820.
