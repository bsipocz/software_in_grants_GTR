However, if the immune system is not properly regulated, it can initiate and perpetuate inflammation. Interleukin 1 (IL-1) is a protein that controls the immune system and problems in maintaining the right amount of IL-1 can be a cause for several chronic conditions. For example, IL-1 can cause fever and rashes in individuals genetically susceptible to hereditary fever syndromes. In addition, diseases such as arthritis (1.4 % UK population), diabetes (3.5 million present cases in the UK) and types of liver diseases, are also linked to IL-1 production triggered inflammation. Importantly, therapeutically blocking IL-1 improves symptoms in many diseased settings. However, as the use of these therapies expands, their limitations are also being recognised. It is therefore important to study how IL-1 and inflammation are regulated so that new and better interventions could be designed in the future. 

We recently identified that an enzyme (E2) regulates IL-1 production in human cells. E2 reduces IL-1 production, and its loss leads to elevated IL-1. However, how E2 regulates IL-1 remains unknown.

Aims and hypotheses: In this proposal we wish to better understand how the E2 molecule works. We hypothesize that, (i) the E2 modifies IL-1 in a way that enhances their clearance, (ii) E2 activity is itself closely regulated, and (iii) genetic loss of E2 will lead to more severe inflammation. 

Experimental plan: We will use modern cellular and biochemical tools to elucidate how E2 regulates IL-1. Proteins that assist E2 in its IL-1-reducing effects will also be studied. We propose to use mice to study the effect of E2 on IL-1 and inflammatory disease. We will genetically engineering a mouse that will lack the gene encoding E2 from specific immune cells. We will study how these mice respond to a bacterial toxin that causes inflammation and conditions that mimic gouty arthritis. This genetic approach will provide a clear picture of how E2 works in immune cells that are the main producers of IL-1 in the body. 

In summary, our work should uncover how E2 affects IL-1 production and systemic inflammation. This work will have wide-ranging clinical and translational impact due to the causal link between IL-1 and the pathogenesis of many autoinflammatory diseases.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>IL-1 (IL-1alpha and IL-1beta) are related inflammatory cytokines that regulate homeostasis, antimicrobial immunity and inflammation. IL-1b is produced upon caspase-1 activation, and deletion of genes encoding IL-1b, its receptor or caspase-1 protects mice against autoinflammation. Importantly, blocking IL-1 signalling in humans improves clinical symptoms in chronic conditions, including gouty arthritis and familial fever syndromes. IL-1 cytokines are transcriptionally induced by NF-kB in phagocytic cells. However, how IL-1 proteins are turned over remains unclear. We recently described the E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme UBE2L3 as a post-translational regulator of IL-1 protein levels in human and mouse macrophages. We found that UBE2L3 silencing increased the cellular pool of pro-IL-1b protein available for processing by caspase-1. On the other hand, UBE2L3 over-expression enhanced K48-ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of pro-IL-1b. UBE2L3 is associated with autoinflammatory diseases such as lupus and Crohn's colitis, and is an essential gene. However, its roles in the immune system remain unclear. In this proposal we aim to study the molecular mechanisms of UBE2L3 action in vitro and in vivo. We will investigate site-specific ubiquitylation of IL-1 and the involvement of UBE2L3 associated E3 ligases. How UBE2L3 activity is regulated in cells by its own ubiquitylation will also be determined. IL-1-driven inflammation in vivo will be studied using a newly derived myeloid-specific conditional Ube2l3-deficient mouse. Models of IL-1-linked inflammation, such as response to lipopolysaccharide and monosodium uric acid crystal-induced peritonitis, will shed light on the systemic roles of UBE2L3. Together, these studies will clarify mechanisms of UBE2L3-dependent down-regulation of IL-1. Our studies on UBE2L3 should have wide implications, and could be exploited to design new strategies to dampen IL-1 for clinical benefits.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>This proposal will address questions related to the fundamental biology of innate immune signalling. Impact in academic settings will be immediate and measurable however, non-academic impact are also identified and described below. As our work is related to clinically relevant areas of study, in the long-term, we expect that our work will impact the health and well-being of individuals not just in the UK, but also world-wide. 
Academic beneficiaries from our work have been summarised in a separate section. Briefly, these will include scientists working on in innate immunity, ubiquitin-proteasome area, the biology of host-pathogen interactions and autoinflammation. 

Potential commercial-sector beneficiaries - Our findings reveal a new mechanism of down-regulation of IL-1 production and inflammation through UBE2L3. In the long term, the private sector stands to benefit from this research. Neutralising IL-1 action is a successful therapeutic strategy and such 'biologicals' are marketed by leading pharmaceuticals such as Amgen, Novartis and Regeneron. Small and large private research organisations working in areas of autoinflammation are well positioned to exploit some of our findings. The use of anti-IL-1 is rapidly expanding, especially because of its better tolerance and lower risk of infectious diseases in patients, as compared to anti-TNF therapy. However, there are issues related to tolerance and side-effects of current anti-IL-1 therapeutics. Therefore, new strategies that could complement current ones, such as our findings on down-regulation of IL-1, should have significant translational implications. Such impact is likely over the next 5-15 years. 

Potential impact from contributions to health - IL-1 is now linked to a large number of non-communicable diseases, including those associated with modern lifestyle, such as diabetes and atherosclerosis. While our studies are fundamental in nature, their impact can be gauged based on the large number of clinical cases that are affected by dysregulated IL-1. For example, primary Cryopyrin-Associated Auoinflammatory syndromes (FCAS, Muckle Wells disease, NOMID) hereditary fever-related autoinflammatory syndromes are rare (1 in ~400,000 births) but, they usually respond well to anti-IL-1 treatments. Other diseases linked to IL-1 are more common and have more complex aetiologies. For example, sterile-inflammation linked to bowel cancer (~40,000 new cases in 2013), gouty arthritis (1.4 % UK population) and diabetes (3.5 million present cases in the UK) are on the rise. Complications from atherosclerosis (which causes cardiovascular disease, which caused an estimated 28 % of all deaths in the UK), obesity (which affects ~25 % population of England) are more common and difficult to treat. While our work does not address these diseases directly, several early trials have showed that anti-IL-1 therapy can help control inflammation in these conditions. Therefore, our fundamental studies related to the production of IL-1 will add to the knowledge resource in the field and therefore indirectly impact the health of a large number of individuals. Realistically, benefits are likely to be apparent over time periods of a decade or longer. 

People economy, education and training - The diverse approaches used in this proposal make it a particularly rewarding project for a postdoctoral fellow and a technician. This proposal uses cell signalling analyses as well as biochemical studies with recombinant proteins. In addition, the use of mouse models offers opportunities to learn additional skills. Similarly, PhD students in my laboratory stand to gain from this experience at an early stage in their scientific career. People with these skills are in demand in research and consulting. Trained personnel would be able to make meaningful contributions to future scientific, commercial and educational endeavours and add to the competitiveness and economic growth of the UK biomedical sector.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>489748</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/P022138/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>C6D70A71-8796-47BC-AFE0-CC2286E66A06</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Inflammatory and Immune System</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
