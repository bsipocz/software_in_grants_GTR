&lt;p>Recent research&amp;nbsp;developed a participatory framework which has informed disputes among neighbours and between policy makers and practitioners over deer management. This showed the value of co-construction of maps to facilitate and negotiate management options and to combine practitioner and scientific knowledge across a landscape to create a better understanding of the distribution of a mobile resource such as deer. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>There is now an opportunity to build capacity among conservation agency staff to utilise this framework to engage with land-managers early in the process and foster collaboration over public and private objectives. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>We aim to use a participatory, action learning approach to develop three core skills that are essential to the process: &lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>participatory techniques to identify management issues&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>collating knowledge relevant to the landscape scale deer operate over using GIS&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>analysing the knowledge to inform management issues. &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>This project will be undertaken as a trilateral in which stakeholders, policymakers and researchers work together in an adaptive and interactive manner and will lead to the co-production of a 'Best Practice' guide for developing sustainable deer management plans.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>60450</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Innovations in collaboration : developing mapping for adaptive deer management</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>07654204-B45B-45C9-B72E-5CE2102E8767</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Poster presented at Scottish Game Fair 2011 workshop

Regulatory enforcement can have limited impact because of the resultant conflict and lack of policing resources. Collaboration and voluntary approaches can generate local solutions, yet there is a lack of capacity to achieve this. This project provided insights to the Scottish Parliament Rural Affairs Committee during deliberations on a statutory versus voluntary approach to deer management in new legislation. The Scottish Government recognise the need for an ecosystem approach and mapping-based tools provide part of the mechanism for combining stakeholder and scientific knowledge and exploring social, economic and environmental implications of future management options.

Reflections on Government goals &amp;amp; capacity: Our work prompted acknowledgement of resource constraints affecting policy delivery and revealed significant differences between managerial and frontline agency staff over perceived needs and barriers (Section 2d). In Cumbria, our reframing of deer management and map-based communication approach has resulted in the regional Deer Officer being invited to join the NE ecosystem planning process.

Building capacity &amp;amp; momentum: Interest in our work and momentum generated through the Scottish case study benefited from early awareness-raising via newsletters and attendance at networking events. With GIS support from the Park Authority and by identifying relevant existing datasets, we reduced the technical complexity of our framework to meet stakeholder capabilities, so reducing potential barriers to uptake. Our mapping report has been instrumental in disseminating these principles and examples (ROS: Mapping tools for collaborative deer management). 
Continuing influence and impacts: The balance of engagement has shifted as our framework becomes embedded within practice: the Scottish case study built sufficient momentum for participants to take a lead, with ongoing support from project staff. This stakeholder-led strategy replaced proposed deer sector and good practice workshops, and is reaching a wider range of users than is possible through single events. By contrast, in NW England, a Best Practice event enabled us to generate wider awareness about changing policy drivers, disseminate lessons from Scotland, and gather information on capacity-building needs in England. These efforts are generating increased demand for the participatory framework</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>BF451193-FE35-457A-868C-574D040514FD</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56cc48f6dbedd1.87134407</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The work has shown the value of map-based participatory methods (participatory GIS) to integrate local knowledge with ecological understanding across the landscape over which the resource occurs. This approach provides visual and flexible tools to support a voluntary process for negotiating management options for achieving multiple interests. Our experience reinforces the importance of using good practice guidelines for effective stakeholder participation (see http://www.macaulay.ac.uk/economics/research/SERPpb1.pdf).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Requests for assistance indicate a demand for increased capacity to utilise this framework when considering the future land management decisions. SNH have requested support to assess the impacts of proposed fencing on deer range use, using the mapping approach to predict risks to SSSI woodlands. The Association for DMGs has requested a joint presentation on the mapping approach from private sector (ADMG), public sector (National Park) and researchers.

The need for SNH to implement the new Code of Practice for Deer Management (2011) and translating ecosystem service strategy into practice will create further impetus for governing bodies to seek adaptable and accessible frameworks to facilitate negotiation, and is likely to lead to changes in agency working practice. The UK-wide expansion of deer populations, particularly in urban areas, is anticipated to generate interest in collaborative frameworks that incorporate multiple values. Wider engagement will be needed to improve public and local authority understanding and debate acceptable social and environmental carrying capacities and costs of differing management options. Some deer managers are now taking a greater interest in habitat impacts caused by deer and this may generate a need for researcher engagement to provide training and develop acceptable indicators for monitoring impacts.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>073A043A-8561-4C2A-BE34-5599F6AB311D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56cc4840c99559.39264326</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.macaulay.ac.uk/RELU/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>This is a mixed method data collection.
