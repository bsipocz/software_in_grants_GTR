This problem might come up when analysing a patient's blood or urine in the hope of diagnosing a disease, or when working with cell cultures in order to investigate fundamental mechanisms of the cell. Most biological samples are extremely complex and may contain tens of thousands of distinct compounds which may be present in the sample in a very wide range of concentrations. Sophisticated scientific instruments called 'mass spectrometers' are often used to analyse them. These provide a variety of techniques for measuring how heavy the various compounds in the sample are, which help scientists deduce their most likely identities.

Mass spectrometry experiments tend to produce so much data that it is impractical for researchers to manually inspect all of the recorded output. Instead they rely on mathematical procedures which can be implemented automatically by computers to identify the most important features of the recorded data and summarise them in a way that makes it easier for scientists to work with. The scientific discipline that concerns itself with the development of these mathematical procedures is known as 'Bioinformatics' and it extends to many other types of biological data than those produced by mass spectrometers. 

The design of improved Bioinformatics techniques to assist in the analysis of mass spectrometry data is a very active area of research. But while the various proposed techniques tend to perform more or less the same set of tasks they may perform them in very different ways. Their reliability in accurately extracting and reporting the appropriate features of the data can be quite variable, and will depend on the sample analysed, the instrument used and the experience of the scientist in using them. This introduces a lot of uncertainty into the data, which can make it difficult for scientists to properly determine what conclusions they can draw from it. This is considered a very serious problem as there have in the past been high-profile cases where researcher using mass spectrometry data misinterpreted their results leading to false hopes of powerful new diagnostic procedures.

There exist well-established procedures from the field of statistics that help scientists understand the uncertainty associated with their data. But these methods have so far only been applied to a very limited extent in analysing mass spectrometry data - most likely because it was assumed to be too difficult to apply them in this context. But recent work by the applicant has demonstrated that such statistical tools can in fact be applied quite broadly, provided that accurate mathematical models are available to describe the measurement errors that arise in mass spectrometry experiments. 

The aim of this project is to provide scientists with a better understanding of the range of conclusions they can draw from their mass spectrometry experiments. This will be done by developing more accurate mathematical models to describe the workings of mass spectrometers and thereby enable the use of better statistical methods. This is a new approach to Bioinformatics which could come to be used for analysing the data produced by a much broader range of scientific instruments than just mass spectrometers. And in the long term it may even have an impact on the way scientific instruments are designed as these might be specifically optimised to produce data that can lead to a more informative statistical analysis. 

The research will be carried out by Dr. Andreas Ipsen and Professor Gareth Brenton, at the Institute of Mass Spectrometry at the University of Swansea. Dr. Ipsen will also spend one year at the Middle Atlantic Mass Spectrometry Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University, which is led by Professor Robert Cotter.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The aim of this study is to develop statistical tools that will allow experimentalists to quantify the uncertainty associated with biological mass spectrometry measurements. Current methods for the analysis of such data are of a rather poor statistical standard, as they do not allow for the use of well-established statistical procedures such as hypothesis testing and maximum likelihood estimation. Recent work by the applicant has demonstrated that such tools can be used when the statistical distribution of the data can be described mathematically, but at present this constrains their use to a small subset of the data-analytical problems encountered. Through improved statistical modelling we hope to expand the scope of their applicability.

Various aspects of the instruments must be characterised as part of this study. These include the shapes of mass peaks, and the uncertainty inherent to the detection system. We will investigate these features by means of direct experiments using the mass spectrometry facilities at Swansea and Johns Hopkins and through the use of software tools. Should direct mathematical characterisation prove too difficult, we will explore the use of statistical procedures that can accommodate for the lack of this information. We will use the resulting model to solve a number of central problems that arise in the analysis of time-of-flight mass spectrometry data.

Mass spectrometry is used in numerous areas of medical research, ranging from disease diagnostics to basic cellular research. All areas in which it is used would benefit from sound statistical methods for accounting for the uncertainty in the data as well as from potential improvements in the accuracy with which measurements can be made. If the study is successful in demonstrating the benefit to the statistical analysis of detailed instrument modelling, it could have an impact on instrumental design of both mass spectrometers and other scientific instruments.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>In the longer term, the proposed research could come to have a very substantial impact on the way in which data from mass spectrometers and other advanced scientific instruments is analysed and interpreted, which would bring about a very wide range of benefits in many areas of society. Better methods of data analysis would mean that any given research question could be addressed more quickly, leading to higher general economic efficiency where the instruments are used, and to better health where medical research is involved. But in the short term the most immediate beneficiaries will be mass spectrometry manufacturers, as the proposed research will help them construct instruments that provide more accurate measurements and which produce data that allow for a meaningful statistical analysis. More fundamentally, it could help to bring about a new approach to the development of mass spectrometers.

A central feature of this project is that it will establish a link between instrumentation and the statistical analysis of the output data and this may provide engineers involved in instrumental design with a more appropriate set of criteria for determining what constitutes a 'good' mass spectrometer. Currently, heavy emphasis is placed on developing mass spectrometers with improved mass accuracy, resolution and dynamic range. But these measures are of no inherent interest to researchers - they are relevant only to the extent that they help them draw inferences about the sample being analysed. It is therefore important to bear in mind that the fundamental measure by which the quality of mass spectrometers should be judged is the range of inferences that we can draw from the data they produce and the ease with which this can be done. But these are qualities that are derived directly from the statistical analysis of the output data, and as we hope to demonstrate, such an analysis will be much more powerful if fundamental features of the data can be characterised mathematically. It is therefore quite possible that a mass spectrometer which is poor by the conventional measures of mass accuracy, dynamic range and resolution, but which has well-defined mass peaks and a mathematically well-characterised detector system could be considered superior to a mass spectrometer that performs extremely well by the conventional measures, but which cannot be properly characterised mathematically. 

While the convention is for the statistician to develop a statistical methodology that can accommodate the data output by an instrument that has been designed independently by the engineer, taking a more integrated approach is not at all unreasonable and could prove to be highly beneficial. Thus, mass spectrometers might be deliberately designed so that the data produced can more easily be described by a probability distribution so that relevant estimators and test statistics can more easily be obtained. This applies to mass spectrometers other than time-of-flight and indeed to any analytical instruments that produce inexact measurements.

If such a framework for the development of mass spectrometers could be established in the UK, it would clearly be of great commercial benefit to any companies involved. It is also quite possible that some aspects of the knowledge generated might be applicable to the development of other scientific instruments. Given the novelty of the approach, it could, if it proves very successful, have a positive impact on the general reputation of the UK-based research effort.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>265594</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>By using a mathematical model that properly describes the probability distribution of data acquired on a TDC (time-to-digital) based time-of-flight mass spectrometers, the method of maximum likelihood has been used to provide estimates of mass peak intensities that are accurate even when the instrument is severely saturated. The application of maximum likelihood estimators to this problem is novel as is the use of a detailed and accurate mathematical model, and the performance is considerably better than that of existing saturation correction methods.

The algorithm has a number of uses in the analysis of TOFMS data. It is helpful in quantitative studies where a wide dynamic range is often critical. It is also useful in determining the identity of unknown analytes through their isotope pattern, as it largely eliminates the distortion of these due to detector saturation. Moreover, maximum likelihood estimates are a prerequisite for the use of the likelihood ratio test which can be used to address a very broad range of data analytical problems.</gtr:description><gtr:id>60535935-CAE9-46B7-A660-FE883BE141FA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The algorithm has now been published.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56db235852e0f8.00849031</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Orders of magnitude extension of TOFMS dynamic range</gtr:title><gtr:type>Computer model/algorithm</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>A model has been developed that can in principle determine both the intensity and the centroid distribution of mass peaks generated from mass spectrometers that employ ADCs and electron multipliers.

The algorithm is primarily intended for use in a study that will cast light on the fundamental ability of any mass spectrometer to distinguish small molecules. However it can be used in any study that requires knowledge of fine-structure isotope patterns, and will likely be especially useful when many of these need to be determined at once.</gtr:description><gtr:id>2C72FA41-E2D3-4A4E-98B6-7104F6137DB1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>An open source implementation of the algorithm (an R package called 'ecipex') has now been made freely available following the publication of this method.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56db243ce6d8c5.07399345</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Fourier-based calculation of fine-structure isotopic abundance patterns</gtr:title><gtr:type>Computer model/algorithm</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ecipex/index.html</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>The software is an R library for the efficient calculation of fine structure isotope patterns.
