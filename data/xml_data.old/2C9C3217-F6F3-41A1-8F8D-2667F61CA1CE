Design</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/L008483/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This research will create a truly innovative, international research network that will stretch far and wide in the area of &amp;quot;Cultures of Creativity and Innovation in Design&amp;quot;. The international research network coordinating body comprises Professors Paul Rodgers and Paul Jones from Northumbria University, Professor Amaresh Chakrabarti, a world-leading researcher in Design Creativity, from the Centre for Product Design and Manufacturing at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore and Professor Lorenzo Imbesi, an internationally-acclaimed researcher in Design Culture, from the School of Industrial Design at Carleton University, Canada. The importance of creativity in the cultural, creative and other industries and the significant contributions that creativity adds to a nation's overall GDP and the subsequent health and wellbeing of its people cannot be overstated. In Europe, the value of the cultural and creative industries is estimated at well over 700 billion Euros each year, twice that of Europe's car manufacturing industry. The value of creativity and innovation, to any nation, is therefore huge. Creativity and innovation adds real value, which enables a number of benefits such as economic growth and social wellbeing. In many societies creativity epitomises success, excitement and value. Whether driven by individuals, companies, enterprises or regions creativity and innovation establishes immediate empathy, and conveys an image of dynamism. Creativity is thus a positive word in societies constantly aspiring to innovation and progress. In short, creativity in all of its manifestations enriches society. This network seeks to gain an understanding of this dynamic ecology that creativity and innovation bring to society. Creativity is a vital ingredient in the production of products, services and systems, both in the cultural industries and across the economy as a whole. Yet despite its importance and the ubiquitous use of creativity as a term there are issues regarding its definitional clarity. A better understanding and articulation of creativity as a concept and a process would support enhanced future innovation. Socio-cultural approaches to creativity explain that creative ideas or products do not happen inside people's heads, but in the interaction between a person's thoughts and a socio-cultural context. It is acknowledged that creativity cannot be taught, but that it can be cultivated and this has significant implications for a nation's design and innovation culture. It is known that creativity flourishes in congenial environments and in creative climates. This research will examine how creativity is valued, exploited, and facilitated across different national and cultural settings as all can have a major impact on a nation's creative potential. The key aim of this network is to investigate attitudes about creativity and how it is best cultivated and exploited across three different geographical locations (UK, India, and Canada), different environments, and cultures from both an individual designer's perspective and design groups' perspectives. The network seeks to investigate cultures of creativity and innovation in design and question its nature. For instance, can creativity be adequately conceptualised in a design context? What role do cultural organisations and national bodies play in harnessing creativity? Where do the &amp;quot;edges&amp;quot; lie between creativity and innovation? Do richer environments and approaches for facilitating creativity exist? What design skills, knowledge, and expertise are required for creativity? Moreover, what are the key drivers that motivate the creativity and innovation of designers and other stakeholders? Are they economical, cultural, social, or political? This research network will host 3 workshops, each one facilitating inquiry amongst invited design practitioners, researchers, educators and other stakeholders involved in design practice.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Key beneficiaries of this research will be researchers, practitioners, and policy makers within the design community including those in academia, industry, public and government bodies. The research planned will examine how creativity is facilitated, developed and rewarded in three different national and cultural contexts by investigating the creative methods and tools exploited by designers and other associated stakeholders. Both individuals and groups within the design community and elsewhere will benefit from this research by gaining a greater understanding of the role that creativity and the mechanisms by which it works in their field/industry. A rich, international network of researchers and practitioners involved in the study of creativity and Innovation in design will be established to explore important issues. The research will impact design education providers (e.g. Universities, Colleges, Research Organisations, Museums), design policy makers (e.g. regional and national governments and bodies - Design Council, Design Research Society, RSA), and practitioners by examining the importance of creativity and innovation in design and the significant contributions that creativity and innovation adds to a nation's overall GDP and the subsequent health and wellbeing of its people. This research will explore cross-national and cross-cultural concepts and attitudes to creativity. It will study how an individual or group opinion on how creativity is conceptualised, facilitated, valued, and exploited can have a major impact on a nation's creative potential. The main strategy for addressing impact in this research proposal is through a combination of systematic but imaginative work, which combines creative practice-based research with sound empirically based research. In this sense, impact is primarily addressed through the quality of the research proposed and by the high calibre of the proposed international research network participants. The impact of this research will be managed and disseminated via a range of both national and international channels. The channels include regional networks for design companies, network participants, subsequent continuing professional development (CPD) workshops, and end of workshop mini exhibitions that will be open to the general public. Other channels will include public bodies and agencies, including those represented by the invited network participants who will provide an effective context for the dissemination of the research findings, as well as established and relevant conferences, journals and trade magazines. International channels will include the research project website, international journals and conferences, and other established research and industrial collaborations of the main investigators. The project's impact will start immediately once funding has been secured. At this stage the dedicated project website will be built. Information on the proposed workshops will be disseminated to the invited network participants for them to distribute, in turn, to an even wider international audience. More long-term impact will be managed via the development of an exploitation plan throughout the proposed research, exploring opportunities with each of the Investigators' Commercialisation Departments. All of the investigators and their host universities have a strong reputation in design research. Moreover, the institutions are excellent providers of dedicated training, CDP activities, and in capacity building support for commercial, public and third sector design organisations. The potential impact of the proposed research thus extends well beyond commercial contexts to include social, cultural and quality of life contexts. In summary, the range of exploitation channels is very broad, ranging from academia through to SMEs to multinational product and service organisations. Outputs are planned in a range of formats that allow us to match dissemination methods to potential beneficiaries.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>35300</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Brunel University London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Brunel Design</gtr:department><gtr:description>Cultures of Creativity and Innovation Workshop 3 - UK</gtr:description><gtr:id>1C6B38CA-7879-4A10-A690-25ABE8DC7223</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None as yet.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5460ced53f1ec0.80865705-9</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Each partner organisation, Northumbria University, UK, the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, and Sapienza University of Rome, Italy, will hold their own workshop to study creativity and innovation across different national and cultural borders.

In Canada, we held a range of sessions across 2 days on 28 and 29 September, 2015 at Concordia University and Teluq, University of Qu&amp;eacute;bec, Montreal, Canada. 

On Day 1, we heard from a number of speakers from both the University and Professional sectors of design in Canada including the Universit&amp;eacute; de Montr&amp;eacute;al, T&amp;Eacute;LUQ University of Qu&amp;eacute;bec, George Brown College, ECUAD, Concordia University, Herman Miller, and Tobboggan Design on the subject - &amp;quot;Creativity as a Strategic Lever for the Knowledge Society&amp;quot;. We invited a number of speakers to present their work on Day 1 including:

1. Fabienne Munch, Directrice de l'&amp;Eacute;cole de design de l'Universit&amp;eacute; de Montr&amp;eacute;al and former Head of design projects at Herman Miller, &amp;quot;What are the most creative people doing to make themselves productive?&amp;quot;
After spending 25 years around creatives, managing multidisciplinary and multicultural design teams, Fabienne M&amp;uuml;nch shared his stories and insights about creative behaviors and patterns of creativity in North America.

2. Diane-Gabrielle Tremblay, Canada Research Chair on the socio-organizational challenges of the Knowledge Economy, T&amp;Eacute;LUQ, University of Qu&amp;eacute;bec, Montreal, &amp;quot;Intermediary organizations and creative sectors: a source of creativity in IT and the Knowledge society&amp;quot; 
Knowledge and creative capital are seen as new sources of competitiveness. Some authors have put forward the idea that new modes of governance such as networks and industrial clusters can foster such knowledge exchanges. We seek to verify if the IT sector can be interested in accessing relational creative capital and knowledge, and what modes of governance or intermediaries can make this happen. 

3. Luigi Ferrara, Dean of the Centre of Arts, Design and Information Technology and Director of the Institute without Boundaries, George Brown College, Toronto, &amp;quot;Creativity and Education in the Wisdom Economy&amp;quot;
The new format for education produces creatives who are able to work collaboratively in the emerging wisdom economy, which grows from a precedence from interdisciplinary collaborations found in the performing arts and entertainment industry (story-telling as wisdom creation through experiences).

4. Laurent Carrier, Head Designer at Tobboggan Design, &amp;quot;Money Talks: The importance of incentives and viable business models to foster innovation&amp;quot;
Countless reasons may motivate designers to create and innovate but nothing gets a project moving like solid seed funding or financial incentives. In this talk, Toboggan will share its views on the business of design, and how the chicken and egg problem of starting creative projects can be re-imagined. 

5. H&amp;eacute;l&amp;egrave;ne Day Fraser, Associate Professor and Designer, ECUAD, Vancouver, &amp;quot;Transversal moves - intentioned ambiguity: cloTHING(s) as conversation&amp;quot;
This talk will present discursive creative based strategies used by an interdisciplinary research team to trigger new intentions, design possibilities and methods of making pertaining to our contemporary use of clothing.

6. Martin Racine, Associate Professor, Graduate Program Director, Department of Design and Computation Arts, Concordia University, &amp;quot;Creative Writing as a Method for Design Research&amp;quot; 
The talk will introduce a number of research projects based on creative writing and prospective scenarios, including Preco, Meta-Morphose, Metacycle and DNA: The Future Life of Objects.

The afternoon of Day 1 was organized around two parallel workshops and a final discussion session around the role, the tools, the approaches and the methodologies of creativity and innovation for Design in Canada. 

Two Parallel Workshops, based on the topic &amp;quot;The Process of Design by Creativity&amp;quot; were held as follows:

1. Integrated Design Innovation 
Chair: Monica Contreras, Director of Design and Construction, Ryerson University, Toronto 
This session examined how integrated design process methodologies can culturally support innovation in Canada where design teams and the design clients are multi-cultural. The workshop explored how cultural drivers can affect innovation.

2. Levels of Design: Business Models, Services, Products 
Chair: Alexandre Joyce, PhD student and ?Ecodesign Advisor at Institut de d&amp;eacute;veloppement de produits
This workshop gave participants a chance to put their creativity to the test by redesigning an existing business model. The participants learned how to use business model patterns and gain a first hand understanding of the link between business models, services, and products.

The second day in Canada, held at Teluq, University of Qu&amp;eacute;bec and titled &amp;quot;Issues and challenges of Canada in the Creative Economy&amp;quot;, was organized as a panel of creators and local development organizations on the Issues and challenges of Montreal in the Creative Economy. The panelists presented their view of Montreal as a creative city and gave insights into creative careers over recent years and the role of intermediary organizations. Representatives from the Municipality, Community Development Organizations, the Cultural and the Creative Sector, Cooperatives for the City Development, Corporations and other local actors all took part in the discussions. 

The morning of the second day was divided into two sessions of speakers, each followed by a roundtable discussion centered on Montreal as a creative city (what does it mean? Where are we?). The speakers and their talks were as follows:

1. Marie-Jos&amp;eacute;e Lacroix, Chef d'&amp;Eacute;quipe, Commissaire au Design, &amp;quot;Design of the city | City of design - Montr&amp;eacute;al Action Plan&amp;quot;
Structured around improving the design of the city and asserting Montr&amp;eacute;al's status as a UNESCO City of Design, the Bureau du design's mandate is to support public commissions in design, develop the market for Montr&amp;eacute;al-based designers and architects and raise awareness of the talents of Montr&amp;eacute;al designers and architects. The UNESCO designation is an invitation to develop Montr&amp;eacute;al around its creative forces in design.

2. Marie-Pier Veilleux, Chambre de Commerce du Montr&amp;eacute;al M&amp;eacute;tropolitain (Directrice, Forums strat&amp;eacute;giques, Leaders internationaux et projets sp&amp;eacute;ciaux), &amp;quot;Cultural sector and the creative industries: catalysts of wealth and influence for the Greater Montr&amp;eacute;al&amp;quot;
We are frequently witnesses to the creative dynamism of Montreal. A true ecosystem of creative industries has formed over the past few decades that exceeds the cultural organizations. But who are they? Beyond the world-class reputation of Montr&amp;eacute;al, what are their impact for our metropolis? How can we strengthen these fundamental sectors and increase their economic impacts?

3. Nadia Lakhdari, C2 Montr&amp;eacute;al (Vice-pr&amp;eacute;sidente ex&amp;eacute;cutive / Cr&amp;eacute;ation et contenu), &amp;quot;The Montreal Creative Ecosystem: strengths and weaknesses&amp;quot;

4. Francis Gosselin, FG8 Conseils (Pr&amp;eacute;sident) - C2 Montr&amp;eacute;al (Ambassadeur), &amp;quot;Can we make a city more creative?&amp;quot;
We often take the &amp;quot;creative city&amp;quot; as an evidence. Everywhere, rankings and labels abound to tell the creativity of a place or another, making it a &amp;quot;marketing accelerators&amp;quot;. As a theoretical concept, the &amp;quot;creative city&amp;quot; is harmed by the current critical literature and the time has come to think of post-creativity. In this game, it is very difficult to &amp;quot;drive&amp;quot; the change. 

5. &amp;Eacute;ric Bourget, Insyders (CEO et Fondateur), &amp;quot;Creativity for business&amp;quot;
Measuring the return on investment on creativity is really hard. This is a major obstacle for creativity to take its place as corporate value. Eric is the CEO and founder of Insyders which seeks to empower design-driven problem solving and innovation in organizations and he will talk about the challenges of making creativity work for business.

6. Carine Valleau, Quartiers Montr&amp;eacute;al (Membre travailleur - Administratrice), &amp;quot;Creativity and developing the city&amp;quot;
Developing the city at the local level is a complex and exciting challenge. Many actors and issues are constantly co-evolving, often in partnership, but also often in silos. Three major sectors distinguish themselves on any given geographical territory: the private sector; the real estate developers and other local companies; the public sector and the community sector. Creativity is key in finding ways to facilitate cooperation, co-creation and ultimately co-design of the city with these three parties. 

7. H&amp;eacute;l&amp;egrave;ne Brown, Carrefour de la Cr&amp;eacute;ation (Entrepreneure sociale, facilitatrice et catalyseur d'actions en innovation sociale - Charg&amp;eacute;e de Projet) with Philippe Demers MASSIVart (Co-Founder and General Director), &amp;quot;Why create a co-working space in the Innovation District ?&amp;quot;
The presentation will introduce the story of the creation of the Carrefour MASSIVart project, with a preview of the new name.

The afternoon session centered on the creative and the cultural sectors and the local economic development in Montreal with presentations of a range of ongoing projects. 

In the UK, a 2 day workshop was held on 12 and 13 May 2015. Day 1 was given over to a strong line up of keynote presenters from universities and creative and cultural organizations. The speakers were:

Prof. Maggie Boden, Centre for Research in Cognitive Science, University of Sussex 

Bill Nicholl, Department of Education, Cambridge University 

Prof. Tom Inns, Director, Glasgow School of Art 

Sevra Davis, Associate Director of Design and Manager, RSA Student Design Awards

Eliza Easton, Creative Industries Federation 

Prof. Sandy Black, University of the Arts, London 

Ellie Runcie, Director of Future Programmes, Design Council

Prof. CJ Lim, UCL, Bartlett School of Architecture.

Day 2 of the UK workshop was more interactive and participants were involved in a number of tasks and activities all aimed at exploring notions and cultures of creativity and innovation in design. This included the following activities:

Activity 1. &amp;quot;This is Creative and This is Innovative&amp;quot;
Using specially designed &amp;quot;This is Creative&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;This is Innovative&amp;quot; probes, the delegates are asked to find patterns, similarities and differences in peoples' interpretations and opinions about what is creative and what is innovative. 

Activity 2 - &amp;quot;Do Something Creative&amp;quot;
This was a &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; activity where each participant was asked to create something creative in response to a global issue (e.g. poverty, security, transport, crime, etc..). Once they were finished each group critiqued one another's creation and then reported back to the whole workshop. 

Activity 3 - &amp;quot;Skills, Knowledge and Expertise for 21st Century Innovation&amp;quot; 
Each group represents the Skills, Knowledge, Experience, and Expertise Required for 21st Century Creativity in the form of a 2D articulated machine constructed from card. What are the key characteristics of this machine? How do these characteristics combine and work with each other? What fuels this machine? What does the machine produce? How? 

Activity 4 - &amp;quot;The Creative City versus the Innovative City
4 groups do one thing and 4 do the other - using collage, and anything else they can find - end result is to present their illustration of the Creative City or Innovative City [this may highlight the organizations, institutions, processes, materials and bodies required to harness creativity and/or innovation]. What are the key differences, if any, between the cities constructed?</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings may well be taken forward as the basis for future research (including grant applications) in this large area.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>74088597-55C9-49B0-8F05-E2FD9F8131CB</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5460eb33400746.14204392</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Energy,Environment,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Retail,Security and Diplomacy,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.culturesofcreativityandinnovation.co.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>631A1F43-B0E2-47FB-94D6-C8D27032E505</gtr:id><gtr:title>Comparing University Design Students' and Tutors' Perceptions of Creativity</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Design Journal</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b754fc35d7507e6ce970e53cebdcbe2d"><gtr:id>b754fc35d7507e6ce970e53cebdcbe2d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rodgers P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>14606925</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a8fdc6cbe2550.87762625</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A64C269A-E0B0-4647-B0CF-F48649EC7CAF</gtr:id><gtr:title>EXPLORING NOTIONS OF CREATIVITY AND INNOVATION IN DESIGN</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d4e71335277ddcb699ed339b43ccac0b"><gtr:id>d4e71335277ddcb699ed339b43ccac0b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rodgers, P.
