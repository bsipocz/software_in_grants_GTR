These dynamics have recently acquired more importance across the arts and humanities research-base. However, while many have tried to advocate for the knowledge engagement and collaborative partnership that involved arts &amp;amp; humanities departments and external arts, creative and cultural organisations, there has been very little opportunity for academics and practitioners to reflect on this creative engagement and the opportunities, benefits and challenges it presents. 

This research network aims to create a platform for discussion between academics, practitioners, artists, cultural organisations, business development managers and other university directors about knowledge connections and collaboration between universities and the creative and cultural sector. Whilst there have been related policy documents and analyses published recently, there has been little coordination of current research, knowledge exchange and collaboration between academia and external partners in this area.

The research network has four main objectives:
1. Compile a literature review of existing research which aims to address the role of knowledge exchange and collaboration across academia and the creative and cultural sector;
2. Develop an open knowledge platform which acts as point to reference in the work of academics and practitioners in this areas, with case studies, links, interviews working papers and policy briefings;
3. Through systematic analysis, develop a clearer articulation of the relationship between A&amp;amp;H teaching and research and the creative economy, based on data collected through the project, interviews and seminar presentations;
4. Explore international perspectives on the 'creative campus', and in particular the Australian context, in order to understand different approaches and opportunities coming from outside UK. 

To address these objectives, the research network aims to host five seminars in UK and one international seminar in Australia and also develop an online platform and website to share case studies, knowledge and practice. The seminars will be hosted by five different institutions across UK and the Queensland University of technology, focusing on 6 specific key topics:

- Higher education, communities and cultural regeneration (University of Kent)
- Higher education and the arts and cultural sector (University of Manchester)
- Spaces and networks as shared platforms: creative arts &amp;amp; creative industries (University of Coventry)
- Creative graduates and creative careers: embedding creativity (LCACE, London)
- Creative engagement and creative economy: the Australian experience (Queensland University of Technology) 
- Creative knowledge, digital co-production and communities (University of Newcastle)

The website will be used as a knowledge bank and every month, also in collaboration with the other academics partners involved, a brief article / interview or case study will be published to provide further examples of collaborative dynamics and engagement. The website will also include a moderated blog which will allow other academics or practitioners to be involved in the debate. Alongside this open platform, further means of dissemination are also planned, such as an edited book which collects case studies, reflection and experiences in the national and international context about interaction between HE and the creative economy. 

The activities of the research network will give the AHRC, the arts &amp;amp; humanities research community and creative and cultural practitioners a consolidated platform to engage in knowledge exchange and open external relations, offering an opportunity to critically reflect on previous partnerships and collaborations and to foster and support future ones.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research network concerns three different levels of engagement (and potential impact) with research beneficiaries, across a range of dimensions. These dimensions are addressed by series of six seminars hosted by the network, which provide the means of bringing together and synthesizing knowledge and experience of participants, through case studies, discussion and debate. These dimensions are multiple: they include locality, regeneration, involvement and impact on local communities, the articulation and involvement of arts and cultural organisations, the role of spaces and dedicated places within the creative campus, digital technologies, skills development, graduate progression and the creative workforce, and international approaches and leadership in creative industries higher education. The potential impact therefore lies in the opportunities for seminar participants and broader communities of interest and practice to critically engage with these debates and further their knowledge and understanding. Research beneficiaries are therefore identified as:

1) Creative industries, arts organisations and the creative practitioners' communities in UK. It is acknowledged that many universities work closely with their local creative industries as well as with national and international players in the creative economy. However, the role played by these external partners is often not fully explored. The network will give voice to these external partners and explore their perspectives towards and experiences of collaborations and partnerships. The impact will be improved understanding of the dynamics of collaborative working and practice sharing on how to establish collaborations and work together. This knowledge and information will also be made available through the website, to create a way for arts organisation and creative practitioner who yet do not engage with higher education to learn about modes and models of engagement and opportunities to establish contacts.

2) Policy makers involved in the creative economy both at local and national levels, and in arts, higher education and economic development contexts. The project will raise awareness about the role of higher education (and specifically arts &amp;amp; humanities) in relation to the creative economy but will also be able to provide case studies as well as critical consideration on the potential and difficulties emerging from practice in the sector. Therefore it is hoped that this improved knowledge of dynamics of engagement will benefit policy makers developing university agendas in this area and national bodies that want to better understand how academics and external organisations interact.

3) International audiences The UK has been recognised as a global leader in the knowledge and policy aimed towards the creative economy (as promoted by the British Council with its international programme) and it is hoped that this research network will give further international profile to UK knowledge and expertise as well as invite future international collaboration in this area of work. 
This impact will be achieved through a robust dissemination plan for seminars research outputs. In particular, it will include: a seminar report compiled with the hosting institution after each seminar; three policy briefing documents developed by the PI and Co-PI to be shared with policy makers to inform them of the findings and issues emerging during the seminars. With the help of hosting universities, researchers and practitioners and PI and Co-PI, the project aims to update the website with a monthly case study, presented with images, interviews and audio-visual material from the HEIs and partners involved in the specific case study. Alongside this dissemination the PI and Co-PI (with other potential participants) aim to compile an edited volume providing a theoretical framework and analysis of key findings and emerging issues from the network.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>33617</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>8000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>Australia, Commonwealth of</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>AUD</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>Australia</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_AU</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>ARC Discovery Project 'So what do you do?
