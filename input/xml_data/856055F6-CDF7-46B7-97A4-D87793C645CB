When the first moves towards d&amp;eacute;tente in Europe were made in the late 1960s, it was apparent that the process would be incomplete if it did not also address the military dimension of East-West relations in Europe. The impetus for talks on conventional force reductions also came from domestic political pressure in the United States, Britain and Germany to reduce forces despite the perceived imbalance of force levels favouring the Eastern side.\nDespite the centrality of this issue to East-West relations and arms control during the Cold War, the talks on 'mutual and balanced force reductions' have been largely ignored by Cold War historians. The existing literature dates mostly from the 1980s or before and is based on secondary sources from the strategic studies literature and then available official documents. It largely consists of accounts of the details of the talks available in open sources without much analytical import.\nNew archival materials have become available that allow us to test the conventional interpretation of both NATO and Warsaw Pact policy towards conventional arms reductions in Europe. These include the full range of documents from the United Kingdom, the United States and the Federal Republic of Germany. Of particular interest is the full set of documents of the East German delegation to MBFR that has recently become avilable in the Federal Archives in Freiburg. These include all of the internal materials, protocols of meetings held, internal briefings to the East German leadership and a host of Soviet documents. In addition to those files, the East German military document collections in the Federal Archives also include extensive materials about military policy, the perception of NATO policy and strategy and the analysis of Warsaw Pact military exercises.\nThis path-breaking research project is the first effort to reconstruct the history of the talks on mutual force reductions in Europe on the basis of primary documents from all of the main participating countries. It is designed to produce a major contribution to Cold War History and will be of interest to experts in strategic studies, international security and military history.\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>1. Who will benefit?\nThere are two primary non-academic beneficiaries of the research:\ni) The political establishment, including in particular those policymakers and strategic analysts involved arms control and international negotiations.\n.\nii) Public figures, opinion formers and NGOs involved in advocacy of international security strategies and international negotiations in relation to arms control and international conflict \n\n\n2. How will they benefit?\nThere are crisis regions in the world today that involve situations with some parallels to the Cold War confrontation in Central Europe. The 'stability instability paradox' that was formulated with regard to the threat of conventional war in Europe is now being applied to relations between India and Pakistan. The 'mutual and balanced force reduction' talks involved the development of sophisticated models of confidence-building measures which could find application in contemporary crisis regions such as the Korean peninsula or South Asia. \n\n3. What will be done to ensure that they benefit from the research?\nIn the United States the primary way whereby the non-academic community interfaces with Cold War research is through the Cold War History Project at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington, DC. The research will be disseminated through the occasional publication series of the Center and the regular public meetings that take place. Likewise results of the research and possible applications will be disseminated through the Royal Institute of International Affairs and the Royal United Services Institute with whom the applicant has strong links, as well as Cold War History conferences organised by the German Historical Institute, the Cold War History Project and at various universities (such as King's College London, the LSE and German Military History Research Institute).\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>92051</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I004203/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4CC238CE-229E-47B9-A4BD-01A3E3C7000C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Diplomacy &amp; Internat Relations</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DF8321C4-0BDE-4E78-8A6D-3F3FA99A9138</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>War Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
