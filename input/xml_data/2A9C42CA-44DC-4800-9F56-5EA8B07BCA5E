This exhibition, entitled 'Hide and Seek: Difference and Desire in American Portraiture', was the first ever by a major American museum to focus on images of and by lesbian, gay and transgendered people from the late 19th century to the present. It offered a fascinating glimpse into the ways sexual minorities have portrayed themselves and others over the course of a century that saw both the formation and the fracture of minority community identities. This project seeks to explore these images and the concerns they project via the medium of original poetry and asks how poetry can help to clarify and articulate the network of desires and fears that lie behind many of these portraits. The poems will offer themselves as a kind of translation into language of the visual images in question but will also ask what type of poem or 'translation' is best able to interpret the often sophisticated nature of the images in question. There is a substantial critical literature on the nature and function of 'ekphrasis' -or the verbal representation of visual art- but very little ekphrastic poetry or creative prose that reflects explicitly on its own processes or on the ways it may enrich and magnify the visual images to which it responds. This kind of poetry may even mix poetry and criticism in innovative genre breaking ways. Apart from the production of an original book containing such poems, a conference bringing poets, artists and critics together will reflect on the project's principal discoveries. This will be supplemented by poetry readings and workshops given at major art galleries in the UK and the USA which will help to broaden the appeal of this already popular type of poetry. It will help the public to better appreciate the ways in which poems do not simply entertain or reinforce established knowledge but act as a form of research and add to our knowledge of the relationships between verbal and visual art.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Public Sector Bodies and Wider Audiences: Museums, galleries

This practice-led research project will be of direct interest to a variety of museums and galleries. Experience of 'impact' activity generated by my previous AHRC funded project on French influenced Scottish art proves that research outputs linking poetry and painting help museums and galleries to stimulate interest in their collections and find a ready place in their education and outreach programmes. A seminar I gave as part of the St Andrews based poetry festival, Stanza, earlier this year on the theme of ekphrasis generated a body of poems by seminar participants that were subsequently exhibited at an exhibition of paintings by William McTaggart at St Andrews Museum seen by 30,000 members of the public. The National Portrait Gallery in Washington has a significant outreach programme and through my connection with one of the organisers of the Hide and Seek exhibition I will be able to help participants to produce their own work in response to the Gallery's collections, thus deepening their appreciation of its relevance in their lives. It is my intention to repeat this process with the other Galleries in Scotland I have worked with over the past five years, including the National Galleries of Scotland, Edinburgh, Kelvingrove Art Gallery, Glasgow and St Andrews Museum, St Andrews. Crucially, one of these seminars will be timed to coincide with the proposed academic conference so that this conference may take place in a wider context of public interest generated by the museum seminars thus helping to break down perceived barriers between specialist and wider audiences. The conference will also feature readings by established poets that will be open to the general public and these will take place in one of the galleries in question. Furthermore, it is normal for Museum and Gallery employees and specialists to attend and sometimes help facilitate these seminars and I would hope that the impact of the innovative poetry generated by the project would be of direct use to them in the design of future exhibitions and outreach programmes. 

One important aspect of the project's focus is the creative work made by gay, lesbian and transgender artists over the course of the twentieth century. By organising the impact activity outlined above and situating these seminars in publicly funded, 'mainstream' institutions my project will contribute to an increased public awareness of the role of minority sexual orientation in the production of some of the twentieth century's significant art. One of the seminars/workshops will take place at Glasgow's annual festival of gay, lesbian and transgender art, 'Glasgay', where participants will have the opportunity to produce their own poetry and prose in response to the art currently being produced by 'queer' Scottish artists and featured annually at Glasgay.

In terms of realistic timescales for impact activity, impact workshops will take place just prior to the conference in May and June 2013. This will generate new work by members of the public with the potential to prepare and feed into the June conference workshop and the Glasgay festival which always takes place in November. Thereafter, the publication of the project in book form will offer further opportunities for readings and talks at future dates.

The project brings skills benefits to myself as PI. It further enhances and promotes my profile and track record as a specialist practice-based researcher able to communicate with wider audiences and to find creative outlets for research dissemination. It offers valuable experience of working with major cultural non-university institutions. The project's intended development of a new kind of critically inflected poetic writing will also help to develop me as a research leader in the field of creative writing where the dialogue between creative practice and critical reflection is key to the discipline's advancement.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>75270</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Kelvingrove Museum and Art Gallery</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Writing into Art</gtr:description><gtr:id>933235C2-D041-419A-A327-2B628099B617</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b9594d2cb9594d4a-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>This international conference on ekphrasis was part of the Hide and Seek project submission.

Apart from bringing together poets, academics and artists specialising in ekphrasis, the conference embedded an impact workshop at its heart. This was led by visiting plenary speaker, American poet Cole Swensen, who workshopped a series of poems commissioned for the conference from local poets based in Glasgow. The aim here was to introduce local writers to innovative ekphrastic theory and practice.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>015701E2-A44A-4BAE-92CF-E3C20B73F288</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545ca9cc075528.02294765</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project sought to develop insights and expand techniques present in my most recent collection of poetry, Finger of a Frenchman (Carcanet, 2011). Towards the end of that book I evolved a hybrid form of critically inflected lyric prose which - as I argued in the 'Afterword' and an accompanying critical article- was the only form adequate to a reflection on sophisticated examples of late twentieth century art. The portrait project outlined above was conceived initially as a crucible for further experimentation and as a way of asking what this type of ekphrasis might add to our understanding of the visual representation of and by lesbian, gay and transgendered individuals. As the sequence developed, however, lyric forms reasserted themselves and resulted in the creative subversion of my own intentions. The exhibition in question -the first in America to focus on queer art and culture from the late 19th century to the present- offered an insight into what Eve Kossofsky Sedgwick called 'the fractal intricacies' of identity formation and dissolution over the course of the twentieth century and my project attempts to present how I sought to uncover and deploy the rhetorical strategies most appropriate to its verbal translation. As the publications associated with this project make clear the major key finding was the evolution of a type of lyric that translates major European poems while simultaneously acting as an ekphrasis of portraits in the exhibition. Parts of the sequence have been appearing over the past year in various poetry journals and magazines (listed here under 'publications') and the full sequence is scheduled to appear as part of my next book of poems in 2016.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The sequence of poems evolves a completely new form of ekphrasis, one that is part ekphrasis, part translation. It offers a way of 'reading' visual art and poetry simultaneously and offers a new poetic model that could well be of interest to other poets who wish to write in an innovative manner about visual art.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>F91A8565-8ED5-4992-A6BB-4742D47C9AD2</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-841712123.566970277932ca6</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative
