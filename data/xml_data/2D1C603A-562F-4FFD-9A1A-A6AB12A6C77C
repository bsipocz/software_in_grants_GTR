Yet the political and military elites in Britain, even in what many contemporaries regarded as a 'democratic' age, never constituted two wholly separate and distinct castes. My research explores this problem through a study of 264 Members of Parliament who served in the armed forces during the Great War. Transcending the narrow, institutional focus of previous work on British civil-military relations, this project comprises a study of professional and political cultures that also addresses important questions about the nature of the British state and the place of the armed forces within society.\n\nThe 'Service Members' occupied a unique and controversial position in the armed forces, in Parliament, and in wider British political life. Ennobled soldiers had long sat in the House of Lords, but the question of whether an individual could simultaneously be an officer (and thus a servant of the crown) and an MP (and therefore a servant of the people) was far more problematic. Existing constitutional precedent appeared largely irrelevant to the unprecedented conditions of the Great War.\n\nWartime coalition government placed the normal rules of politics under unusual strain. In these circumstances, military service could provide a common identity, and even a basis for common action, for MPs from rival parties. By 1915 an influential lobby of military MPs, both Unionist and Liberal, was campaigning energetically for the introduction of military conscription. My research explores the ways in which the activities of Service Members contributed to the breakdown of conventional party politics, and the extent to which these MPs came to constitute a 'military' faction in the House of Commons.\n\nPolitical interventions by Service Members proved highly controversial. Critics denounced what they regarded as a dangerous and incongruous 'Cromwellian' intrusion into the supposedly democratic politics of the twentieth century. But Fighting MPs did not work simply to advance the agenda of the military establishment at the expense of civilian control. Service Members in the field often used parliamentary privilege to circumvent the military chain of command, sending critical accounts of their military superiors to political colleagues in Westminster and Whitehall. As one MP declared, 'we were the British equivalent of the Soviet Commissars, using the Press, the platform, the House of Commons, and private appreciations - to the rage and despair of all Brasshattery'. My research therefore also explores the novel ways in which Service Members worked to assert parliamentary authority over the military leadership.\n\nMost controversially of all, Fighting MPs who attended the House of Commons during the War came to identify themselves as the political 'representatives' of the armed forces. In doing so they were not simply acting as mouthpieces for the high command, but were consciously staking their claim to political authority on their right to speak 'on behalf' of common soldiers. At a time when an unprecedented proportion of the British population was under arms, these claims profoundly influenced contemporary debates about the nature of citizenship, the rights of electors, and the responsibilities of Parliament. By 1915, even a pillar of the establishment such as 'The Times' was arguing that a House of Commons which did not include soldiers on its benches was not truly representative of the nation, and was therefore neither competent to direct the conduct of the war nor fit to legislate on any other question of importance - from taxation to the enfranchisement of women. By exploring this controversial debate, my research profoundly challenges assumptions about the civilian nature of male political culture in Britain during the twentieth century.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research project will investigate new and important aspects of the political challenges faced by Britain during the course of the Great War, almost a century ago. But the problems and themes with which it is concerned are profound and in many ways fundamental to our national political system, and are of particular relevance today.\n\nReports in October 2009 that General Sir Richard Dannatt - who just months previously had stood down as Chief of the General Staff - would begin advising Conservative Shadow Ministers on Defence questions, would take a seat in the House of Lords, and would consider a post as a junior Defence Minister in a future Conservative government, raised important questions about the involvement of professional soldiers in British politics, and highlighted once again the difficult question of whether it is realistic to expect professional soldiers in a democratic society to be genuinely 'apolitical'\n\nAt the same time, the moral and political authority of the contemporary House of Commons has been seriously undermined by recent scandals, such as that over MPs' claims for expenses. Public frustration is often raised with a Parliament that seems to be packed with 'professional' career politicians, 'out of touch' with the lives of ordinary citizens. In particular, at a time when Britain is engaged in two overseas wars, most MPs have no experience of military service. This is a comparatively recent development, and a striking departure from the state of affairs which prevailed during the decades following the world wars. My research explores the ways in which one particular form of 'outside' experience and expertise has been represented in the House of Commons in the past, and reveals that there may be risks as well as benefits associated with the presence in Parliament of MPs who claim political authority from sources other than the electoral mandate of their constituents.\n\nQuestions of civil-military relations, and the problems of maintaining the authority of MPs and the legitimacy of Parliament as an institution are thus by no means of solely academic interest. \n\nThe questions addressed in my research will be communicated to a wider audience, outside academia, by the presentation of selected themes from the work in a popular history magazine, through the press or radio, and through the preparation of a public exhibition, possibly in collaboration with the History of Parliament project.\n\nIn this way, the research will: \n\n* Enhance public understanding of the functioning of our political processes - in particular, the nature of political representation in the House of Commons, the authority and functions of Parliament as an institution, and the proper relationship of the professional Army to the political process. \n\n* Inform public debate on issues of political, parliamentary, and even military reform.\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>57968</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Engagement with various parliamentary bodies and Royal Historical Society, including preparation of comment piece on commemoration of the Great War</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>505441E0-F9F3-46CA-9582-0DB3D1CF1E94</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The exhibition on Great War military decorations was hosted in the Palace of Westminster in 2015. By providing a database of decorations and awards won by sitting MPs during the war, my contribution helped this exhibition to challenge deeply entrenched views of Parliament as an essentially passive actor during the Great War. Specifically, it served to present an alternative to the popular image of politicians in Westminster forcing onto the nation's youth a military obligation that MPs were not prepared to share. In the process it also served to educate the public about Parliament's role and importance, as well as the complex political and policy implications posed by an apparent militarization of the political elite.

My piece reflecting on the commemoration of the Great War in the British media appeared on the Royal Historical Website in November 2014. The piece generated considerable interest and comment, with the twitter link to this article generating 961 views on the website within the first week.

Besides the outcomes predicted to arise from my briefing to the First World War Centenary Advisory Board and the preparation of the Palace of Westminster exhibition on Great War military decorations (outlined above), my article for the Royal Historical Society has already reached a wide audience. In addition to attracting more than 1000 views on the website, the piece has been widely retweeted, with comments expressing new interest in the subject and agreement with my warnings about the need to</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>546d397fd6b0e5.79812065</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014,2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Engagement update, 2015 - Parliament and World War One: British military voices in politics</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>38DF3FDC-382F-4FC8-ACA7-590987A2F105</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As part of a series of events to commemorate Parliament's involvement in World War One, I joined a panel of serving MPs and Peers at a public event in Westminster to discuss our insights into Parliament's role in the First World War, and the ways in which having a military background and knowledge can influence the thinking, decisions and policy-making of MPs and Lords in present day politics. Other members of the panel included Lord Wallace of Saltaire, Chris Bryant MP, Julian Lewis MP, Keith Simpson MP, Bob Stewart MP, and Danny Kinahan MP.

These include the Parliament and Constitution Centre, the House of Commons Library, the Parliamentary Archives, the Parliamentary Art Collection, the History of Parliament Trust, and the First World War Centenary Advisory Board.

Further details of this impact and engagement work are included in other sections of this report. Broadly, impact and engagement to date have developed along two main lines, both of which continue to expand.

The first, including collaboration with the History of Parliament Trust, the Parliamentary Art Collection, and the Parliamentary Archives, among other bodies, has aimed at informing public debate and understanding about the workings of Parliament, the relationship between the political establishment and the armed forces, and the nature of political representation in Britain - including the types of mandate which parliamentarians might 'legitimately' claim, and the contributions Parliament might make as an institution in times of war.

The second, involving the Royal Historical Society and the First World War Centenary Advisory Board, has sought to engage with public debates about modern representations of the Great War, about ways of effectively fostering a broad understanding of its 'meaning', and about the best means of commemorating the conflict. In practical terms, this has involved attempts to avoid 'commemoration fatigue' among a public at risk of over-exposure to the centenary observations, by stressing that representations of the 'experience' of the war must consistently be complemented by a clear, critical engagement with broader interpretative questions raised by the conflict. These include broad and timeless questions about how and why societies go to war. But they also include more specific controversies explored in my research, which show the profound ways in which the Great War shaped Britain in the twentieth century - for example by re-forging the relationship between the state and the citizen, and by redrawing the boundaries of political citizenship.

Together with my University's Impact and Policy Engagement Manager, I continue to explore potential avenues for developing the impact of this research - in particular by engaging with NGOs and voluntary sector organizations interested in issues surrounding service personnel and veterans, and the means through which their interests can be protected and taken seriously by political leaders.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>945B2D58-D10A-40CA-BEAE-4DF2AA9F00D8</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>546794b6f1b743.58637727</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>By exploring the activities of Members of Parliament on active military service during the Great War, this project has generated major advances in our understanding of a number of substantial problems in modern British political history. These include:

* CIVIL-MILITARY RELATIONS - Research revealed the existence of a cohort of Service Members who worked in Parliament to advance the agenda of their military superiors. But it also revealed the extent to which other fighting MPs interpreted their role very differently - as that of providing parliamentary scrutiny over the armed forces. This project therefore demonstrates the importance of examining the Great War both as an episode in which the military establishment intervened in the workings of Parliament in new, direct, and controversial ways, but also as one in which the operational autonomy of the armed forces was threatened by new types of parliamentary criticism and interference. In doing so, the project provides an important and original new perspective to our understanding of civil-military relations in Britain, which have often been presented simply in terms of a struggle between Cabinet 'Frocks' and the 'Brass Hats' on the General Staff.

* PARTY POLITICS - The readiness of Service Members to define themselves 'as soldiers' in Parliament facilitated the emergence of new factions and groupings within established parties, but also the creation of a new, loosely defined 'military clique' in the House of Commons, which bridged the traditional dividing lines of party politics. The opening up of new fault lines between 'civilian' and 'soldier' MPs had important consequences in terms of legislation and policy - and not only on questions directly relating to the prosecution of the war. But it also contributed to the remarkable disruptions in the operation of party politics in Britain during the war and its aftermath. 

* THE POLITICS OF CITIZENSHIP - Building on recent work by scholars such as Nicoletta Gullace, interested in the 'cultural construction' of politics and the law, this research has provided important new insights into the ways in which categories of political citizenship were conceived and contested during the war. The insistence of some Service Members that military service (but only military service) be a prerequisite of the right to exercise the parliamentary franchise is used here to complicate assumptions about the relationship between 'service' and 'citizenship' seemingly enshrined in the 1918 Representation of the People Act. In doing so it highlights the existence and importance of hierarchies of citizenship in wartime debates about the extension of the franchise - a process which too often has been seen in terms of a process of straightforward 'democratization'.

* PARLIAMENTARY INSTITUTIONS AND POLITICAL LEGITIMACY - This research has explored the implications of the existence of a new, militarized cohort among Britain's political elite to broader questions about the authority of Parliament as an institution. One the one hand, interventions by uniformed military officers in the House of Commons could be criticized as threatening the civilian authority of Parliament. But on the other, the inclusion of 'representatives' of the men in the trenches could be seen as essential to maintaining Parliament's legitimacy as the voice of the nation. This article has therefore made a major contribution to far broader questions about political representation and the authority and stability of Britain's political institutions in a period of crisis and upheaval.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In the context of the Great War centenary, there is a valuable opportunity for communicating research on Parliament's role in the conflict to wider audiences beyond academia - in the process fostering engagement and understanding of Parliament's responsibilities and significance in national life. Groups such as the Parliamentary First World War centenary advisory board have already expressed an interest in precisely these issues.

Perhaps more specifically, my work illustrates not only the advantages but also the potential dangers implicit in alternative models of political representation, or in a system that allows parliamentarians to claim authority or legitimacy from sources other than their electoral mandate. As such this research provides much useful material to inform and engage with contemporary debates about the authority of Britain's parliamentary institutions and of the 'professional' political class.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>85D06FC5-AE57-4C04-A0EE-804D8A88817E</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546dfd46682194.99688955</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>As part of my research I compiled a database of all sitting Members of Parliament who held military or naval commissions, or served in the ranks, during the Great War.

There also exists a database of Peers and their sons who fought in the war, but no comparable list previously existed of Members of the House of Commons who fought in the war.
