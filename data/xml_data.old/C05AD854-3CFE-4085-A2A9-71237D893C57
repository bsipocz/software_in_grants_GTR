Through a series of extended residencies located in disadvantaged communities across Northern Ireland, academic practitioners and postgraduates from the University of Ulster and Queen's University will work together with professional artists to explore ways in which contemporary digital and non-digital arts can have a transformative impact on liminal communities and districts. 

Areas of specific interest include art and public art in local communities, the role of art in a post-conflict society, and the role that art can play in regenerating a region such as Northern Ireland. A key outcome from this work will be the potential to share ideas, activities and experiences with other international contexts which are already looking to Northern Ireland as an example of a post-conflict region. 

The collaboration between Queen's and Ulster, established through a new Creative Exchange Lab (CEL),will enable projects in music, film, drama, creative writing, fine art, to be developed and delivered in communities across Northern Ireland. Each one will involve workshops, creative collaborative projects designed in association with the practitioners and conceived around local issues, histories and contexts. 

The outcomes of the residencies will be presented in a major festival and exhibition hosted across both institutions at the end of 2013 which will showcase the creative outcomes of both practitioners and community participants. Individual projects will later be presented in regional venues for local communities to experience and they will be archived and made available on-line.

A longitudinal study running alongside the residencies will document and report on the creative practice landscape for lone artists and practitioners, creative clusters and networks, and the relationship of these activities to academic research. The study will be explored in a wider regional and national government context for the creative industries whereby funding and support is targeted at SMEs and 'close to market' activities and rarely identifying the needs of solo practitioners and and micro businesses. 

In addition to the study, the residencies will also lead to the generation of new knowledge and working methods about artist and academic engagement in specific communities which are often historically remote from both contemporary arts practice and academia. The breadth creative activities available through both institutions will ensure a wide spread of community projects across Northern Ireland. The public engagement aspect of these residencies will also be beneficial to the participating postgraduate students.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The context, subjects and methods for this KE research are 'close to market' and impact is therefore part of the currency and language of the proposal. The study will evaluate current delivery investments and will enhance the articulation and identification of impact in these SME contexts. There is potential to inform peer review and other assessments and for transferability of skills and knowledge to other disciplines.
A further impact will be driving culture change in local communities, particularly those which are the subject of this programme of research, and in a context where there is recognised under funding and the opening of opportunities for future support and KE.

The research will identify and make proposals to address the specific needs of innovative creative industries companies to strengthen their capacity to innovate and grow. In highlighting and exposing creative practice through residencies and it will also stimulate demand including interest from other sectors with a view to boosting the role of creative industries as a catalyst for SME, district, regional and national development.
The programme of research will achieve economic and societal impact by advancing knowledge, understanding and technology in knowledge exchange with creative SME. Build partnerships to enhance take up of KE and have impact upon the SME sector in so doing contributing to 
UK Economic Competitiveness.

The research has support in the regional and national sector that will promote sustainability of the strategies identified. The research findings will inform the development of policy and of practice.
The collaboration on the use of existing data in order to research demand is evidence of sector support and will promote rapid strategic adoption of key findings. The research is timely - The lead researchers are in dialogue with Government 
(http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/Assembly-Business/Committees/Culture-Arts-and-Leisure/ ), (insert Assembly aims or vision.)

Both institutions have delivered research that utilises engagement, public art and performance to generate thinking and action in order to harness opportunities or addressing seemingly intractable urban challenges. The 'people' and places' theme is directly linked to the emerging understanding of Creative Cities (Charles Landry 2008) The Rise of the Creative Class (Richard Florida 2002) and new approaches to the hyper local (NESTA) . The research will inform concurrent activity including

The CEL research methodolgies of participatory creative engagement in real locales will compliment the digital focus of AHRC Knowledge Exchange Hubs for the Creative Economy at CX and may contribute to material delivered by other Hubs, particularly REACT.

There is timely coincidence of the CEL research period (2013) with Derry hosting City of Culture that will ensure additional and distinctive potential for research interventions and and knowledge exchange. The CEL research will also compliment the recent EU call for research around creative districts in which the University of Ulster contributed to a Derry bid.

The existing hierarchical structures and segregated business sector operating environment may restrict ideas generation and rethinking required in emerging to thrive. There may be impact in new ideas arising for organisational culture to unleash the potential, resources and assets of a city or a cluster.
 
The research will address issues in creative leadership by:
1) taking a demand led approach to research which will involve users and stakeholders at all stages
2) establishing rigorous evidence (demand informed) data on the field
3) establishing networks for realised action
4) research transfer of regional case study for national and international application.
5) feeding directly into Policy
6) developing CPD programmes in response to research findings
7) creating an open source toolkit for creative practitioners</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-06-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>199993</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Echo Echo and Matt Jennings

Belfast. The collaboration aimed to co-curate a live arts-based exploration of an
abandoned music school in Belfast. The project emerged from an engagement with
Dr Richard Brook from Manchester Metropolitan University's Architecture department
on a Modernist tour of Belfast. He described the school as an &amp;quot;architectural gem&amp;quot; in
the style of 'Dudok', a rare kind of Dutch Modernism that is now virtually extinct.
Their initial proposal involved repurposing the building to become a satellite venue as
part of Sonorities.</gtr:description><gtr:id>CFEE29F6-268D-42C7-925B-5ED910AEB70A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Gaining the necessary permissions to use the building proved

The objective of this project was to explore improvisation praxis with multidisciplinary
arts practitioners who work for Open Arts, a Belfast-based arts and disability
organisation. PhD researcher in sonic arts, Juan Manuel Loaiza, engaged small
groups of artists in sessions that were loosely based on an artistic skill or discipline,
to explore the theory and practice of improvisation. The project was based on the
premise that the word 'knowledge' is not restricted to its commonly used
propositional sense: the 'knowledge that' (...that night follows day, etc.). Instead, the
activities were based on the idea that knowledge can also be shared and produced
via action: the 'know how' of our everyday practices, an embodied type of knowledge.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>546506d734dca7.24120501-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Open Arts is a Belfast-based arts and disability organisation who provided specialist knowledge and carried out the activity with their existing client group and new participants.

As part of the Northern Ireland Strategic Action Plan 2014 - 2016 the Creative Businesses have been identified in the Executive's economic and innovation strategies as a key growth sector for the local economy. As government lead on the creative industries, the Minister for the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure (DCAL) is bringing together industry leaders, educators and trade bodies with interests across the diverse range of sub-sectors within the creative industries to create a Ministerial Advisory Forum on the Creative Industries. 
 
The Forum is also closely linked with Creative Skillset NI. Their new Advisory Board will be playing a leading role in identifying key areas where research is needed, promoting our programmes and activities to the wider industry and identifying new opportunities for engagement.
 The Forum will set out the strategic direction of the sector but what can we do to support operationally?
 The most successful model in the UK for integration with the creative sector and industry is REACT http://www.react-hub.org.uk/. At this seminar Jon Dovey, Professor of Screen Media on Dept. of Creative Industries and Director of REACT (Research &amp; Enterprise for Arts and Creative Technologies) an AHRC Creative Economy Hub presented the REACT Model.

The seminar will explore the REACT model and how it could adapt to the NOrthern Ireland Creative Industry context . The seminar audience comprises business contacts, stakeholders and academics. The seminar was followed by meeting with Invest NI and other sector lead bodies.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54650e6cc0a021.60072693</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://cxni.org</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>CXNI Case Studies: Makerday Belfast</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>76A63F79-BB29-47B3-9B14-12113281C556</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Led by Michelle Douglas. Maker Day Belfast was a creative collaborative design weekend focusing on physical

the event was to expose collaborative ways of working as a positive influence in the
production of innovative concepts and products.
The event encouraged a variety of creative practitioners and researchers to join
industry experts from the UK and Ireland to respond collaboratively to themes. These
provocative design briefs were simply key words and phrases such as &amp;quot;elderly,&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;rural,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Northern Ireland.&amp;quot; Four teams utilised soft modelling materials and digital
fabrication tools to co-design imaginative, working prototypes. At the end of the
weekend the teams showcased their design solutions.

CXNI Key Findings - September 2014

1. New platforms for making and connecting - such as co-working spaces and social media - are delivering new opportunities for creative practitioners and researchers to have an impact on one other. Collaborations supported by these new platforms are often ad hoc in that they happen as needs arise or when opportunities appear. These are not new catalysts for collective work, however the ways in which these activities are performed are changing, particularly with regard to the speeds at which self-organisation can occur.

2. Researchers and practitioners, in many cases, have different evaluative frameworks. They may share interests and be working towards similar goals, but the ways in which things are measured and therefore valued and evaluated, is different. We have identified Stark's (2011) &amp;quot;productive friction&amp;quot; as an appropriate conceptual framework to further explore these dynamics. 

3. 'Stability' has been identified as a productive area for further research, so that actors can negotiate different scales - such as the solo practitioner dealing with the large bureaucracy - and to transition between the different methods of evaluation that are an inherent part of knowledge exchange projects.

4. Those drawn to knowledge exchange projects welcome the challenges that come with interdisciplinary collaboration e.g. negotiating new contexts and having their own boundaries pushed. These people are also happy to reconcile that they can only be considered 'knowledgeable' in very specific contexts, and are open to being a 'beginner.' 

5. Hierarchies of 'expertise' should be critiqued from within knowledge exchange projects, to avoid researchers using inappropriate theories or methodologies, and industry partners promoting certain expert points of view to control production processes.

6. In the case studies, broker roles were performed by both practitioners and researchers to manage the expectations of different actors.

7. In the case studies, opportunities to bridge divides between theory and practice - to develop praxis - were limited due to the short timescales of the projects.

8. In the case studies, the knowledge that was exchanged reflected the material qualities of creative and research practices, and can be categorized the following way: 

? Embodied knowledge - learned through creative practice (dancers/musicians/designers/theatre makers)
? Networked knowledge - emergent and ad hoc (opencurriculum)
? Pragmatic knowledge - needs based, arrived at through industry experience or opportunities (Family Friendy Galleries)
? Contextual knowledge - prolonged engagement with specific subject matter (Prison Memory Archive)
? Curated knowledge - drawing together connections to facilitate new knowledge processes (Emer Grant /Sonorities)</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5457f405a49d31.82135344</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Participants in your research and patient groups</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.cxni.org</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>CXNI COLLABORATION INTERCHANGE: UNDERSTANDING NORTHERN IRELAND'S CREATIVE CONNECTIONS</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A4A52971-B3B3-4880-ABD2-DD2F470ACF5A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Ticketed event ( free) in National Museum ( Ulster Museum) 
Our investigations of the catalysts for creative collaboration in Northern Ireland have
centred on seven case studies. These projects responded to our call to study
initiatives that were actively testing the boundaries of academic and practice-based
collaborations. They became involved in CXNI's research with the knowledge that the
collaborative aspects of their projects would be critiqued for the purposes of
identifying emergent challenges and opportunities in the region.
CXNI is a one-year project that will culminate in a half-day event titled 'Collaboration
Interchange: Understating Northern Ireland's Creative Connections'. This follows a
successful multidisciplinary networking event 'Creative Collaborative Futures' that
took place in December of 2013.

This project interrogated how galleries, museums, and project spaces perceive and
are perceived in relation to 'families'. Building on previous research by the two PhD
students involved, the project brought together representatives from Northern
Ireland's creative institutions to develop new approaches to engage parents and
children. Their departure point was the idea that for some these are familiar,
inspiring, vibrant hubs central to the life of the city; while for others they are unknown,
intimidating and difficult spaces. The researchers worked closely with Belfast-based
Young At Art - an organisation that develops creative programs from children and

The #opencurriculum project was proposed and implemented by Chris Murphy, a
multidisciplinary design educator at the University of Ulster, in collaboration with the
Belfast-based web development agency, Little Thunder. This team set themselves
the task of using GitHub - a web-based platform for managing and sharing software
source code - to facilitate the co-creation and sharing of educational content. They
were drawn to GitHub as it has unique features that track content as it changes over
time and between users. Their high level objective was to build a user-friendly web
interface - that utilised GitHub's version control features - for global, collaborative
curriculum development.
