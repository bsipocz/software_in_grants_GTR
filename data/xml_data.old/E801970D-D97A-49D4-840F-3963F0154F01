We are fortunate that the ESRC has already funded the digitisation of Irish census data, North and South after Partition, in the form of the Database of Irish Historical Statistics. This existing resource is central to the project as it tells us about the relationship between religion and a broad range of socio-economic indicators. Combining this with contemporary censuses provides enough data to let us analyse the period from the mid-nineteenth century to the present. We will add a GIS to it to allow us to map these data and explore the spatial and spatio-temporal patterns that they contain. \n\nUnder a grant to the ESRC's Research Method's Programme Drs Gregory &amp;amp; Ell developed 'areal interpolation' techniques that allow us to explore change over time using data standardised onto a single set of administrative boundaries. This allows us to explore detailed patterns of spatio-temporal change without resorting to highly aggregate units such as counties. To complement these methodologically innovative approaches we will also use traditional narratives to add detail about specific places and themes. This will be assisted by our recent JISC grant that is digitising a wide range of journals, monographs and other material related to Irish studies, and by two previous AHRC grants that digitised Irish parliamentary papers. These resources provide us with unrivalled access to material on the island of Ireland and its constituent places. Thus, the GIS allows us to identify the broad stories of the changing patterns of religious identity, while the narrative allows us to tell specific stories about specific places in more detail. \n\nWe will be exploring two key topics. The first is concerned with the long-term relationship between religion and identity, community, welfare and prosperity over the island of Ireland from the mid-nineteenth century to the present. Every census since 1861 provides information on religious denominations. We will also include information from the 1834 Commissioners of Public Instruction which provides some information on religion in the period prior to the Famine of the late 1840s. We will use this to explore the changing relationship between religious identity and factors such as age, gender, class, language, migration, health, education, and social and economic welfare. This allows us to research the spatial, demographic and cultural relationships between religious groups and social and economic marginalisation, the development of social capital, social integration, and health outcomes. One particular aspect that we can explore is the extent to which changes in these have been sudden responses to shocks such as the Civil War and Partition, the start of the Troubles, and the Famine, or whether they have been more gradual long-term changes. In addition to Catholics, Church or Ireland, and Presbyterians, we will also explore more minor Protestant denominations, Jews, and the religions of recent immigrant groups. \n\nOur second, related topic is enabled by the availability of grid square data which allows us to explore the connections between religion and society in more detail for Northern Ireland over the period of the Troubles. In addition to the themes described above, we will also explore the relationship between religion, society, and killings during the Troubles, and how these changed from the late 1960s to the early 2000s. \n\nWe will disseminate to an academic audience using journal articles and presentations. There is also a much broader audience with an interest in Ireland including community leaders, journalists, family historians and lay researchers. We will research these through our electronic atlas and a contemporary paper version of this.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>195629</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project's major achievement has been to explore how the geographies of religion in Ireland have changed over the past two centuries focusing on the different experiences in space and time of the three major religions. This has led to an academic book, three journal articles, invitations to publish in two edited volumes, and a range of academic presentations including a keynote and a plenary presentation at international conferences. To disseminate to a wider audience we have a companion website that presents a summary of the argument of the book together with a wide range of mapping products that will appeal to a broad audience. This was achieved by following our four major objectives. 

1. We created a historical GIS of the changing boundaries of Ireland's administrative units from 1861-1971. Linking data from the Database of Irish Historical Statistics provides the research framework for much of the grant. We also added information from the 1834 Commissioners of Public Instruction. This has proved a very timely development. While historical GIS as a field within history has existed for around a decade it is increasingly being replaced by &amp;quot;spatial history,&amp;quot; a field that stresses the contribution to knowledge that historical GIS resources can make rather than the technology. We believe that this project has delivered one of the first truly substantial works of spatial history. 

2. Using the GIS has allowed us to explore long-term change in religion and society in Ireland with an emphasis on both spatial and temporal detail. In many ways these religious geographies have remained surprisingly stable over time. The patterns found today have clearly recognisable origins in the 16th and 17th centuries. Change has, however, occurred due to social transformations including both long-term processes and short-term shocks. A general long-term pattern has been of movement from rural western areas to more urban eastern parts. Looking at short-term shocks, we believe that the Famine did not affect the Catholic population as disproportionally as has been argued elsewhere, while outside Ulster the Presbyterian population actually increased. Partition did, however, bring major changes in the geographies of the Church of Ireland in particular as its population declined rapidly in what became the Free State. The Presbyterian population south of the border was less affected. These findings are presented in the book, and form the basis of a number of journal articles including the Journal of Historical Geography. 

3. Our work on patterns of violence during the Troubles has shown that there were complex micro-geographies of conflict taking place under the more general umbrella of the Troubles. Overall, killings tended to occur in areas with high deprivation rates and a large Catholic population. Within this, there are very different patterns when killings are divided by perpetrator and victim. One example is that Republicans tended to target security forces in border areas, while the security forces tended to target Republicans in areas such as East Tyrone. Looking at civilian deaths in Belfast, Protestants tended to be killed by Republicans in Protestant areas of west Belfast. Catholics tended to be killed by the security forces in Catholic areas, but by Loyalists in north Belfast where they were deliberately targeted to drive them out of the area. This work has formed the basis of a paper for Political Geography. 

4. We have produced an online atlas of religion and society in Ireland to present our findings to a wide audience. This summarises the book chapters and provides additional maps both as colour bitmaps and as interactive maps produced using Social Explorer. Thus, we are able to summarise complex academic arguments for a wide audience, present our evidence for these using static maps, and allow the reader to investigate in more detail using the interactive product.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The project has led to relationships with a number of important stakeholders.
