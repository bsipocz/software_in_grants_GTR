They include derelict factories, outmoded military installations, defunct holiday resorts and neglected Modernist buildings: the kinds of structures that we all know and habitually ignore. These are not romantic ruins, such as are prized by heritage organizations and visited by thousands of people each year. But these unloved sites tell us more, sometimes, than we care to acknowledge about the taste, culture and history of our own recent past. In their decayed state, they remind us of the fragile nature of progress and recall futuristic dreams that are now consigned to the past.\n\nMy approach to such buildings and places is first of all that of a creative writer, and second that of a cultural historian. Many poets and novelists (from William Wordsworth and John Ruskin to Samuel Beckett and J. G. Ballard) have written about ruins, both ancient and modern. The ruin has been a rich source of metaphors for personal grief, the passing away of civilizations and the melancholy fact of universal decay. I am interested particularly in what happens to writing / to my own writing / when it comes face to face with the remnants of the recent past, which are not so easily consigned to the realm of the picturesque. This project aims to discover a new way of writing about landscape and architecture that will do justice to the strangeness of the ruins of the last century.\n\nThe writing itself is to a large degree the basis of my research. I will produce a book and essays that mix history and memoir, poetic description and architectural appreciation. My focus throughout will be on how my own skills as a writer can develop in response to the physical reality of the ruins in question. Behind this productive and reflective level, however, two other fields of inquiry will open up. First, I will make extensive field visits to the ruins themselves, and follow those up with archival research and investigations in the surrounding communities. Second, I will need to study the history of ruin appreciation itself, as it has developed in literature, architectural history and the visual arts.\n\nThis last category is crucial, because for some decades now the ruins of the twentieth century have been an abiding theme for artists: Robert Smithson, Gordon Matta-Clark, Susan Hiller and Tacita Dean have all made works that circle around this subject. To some extent, my project is a way of discovering how the ideas and methods used by these artists, when confronting such places, might inform the work of a creative writer. I intend to widen the scope of my writing and research beyond the literary world to engage with contemporary art and to collaborate, in my own presentation of my chosen ruins, with artists and photographers. The research, in other words, will constantly cross disciplines and question my own expertise, asking what it means to try to describe something as enigmatic and multifaceted as a ruin.\n\nThe main result of this project will be a book entitled Ruins of the Twentieth Century / a work of 'creative non-fiction' that conjures up the atmosphere of these places, accounts for their dereliction and tries to imagine what future use they might have. I will also write a shorter volume, aimed at a more academic audience, that addresses the philosophical aspects of the subject of ruination. Other offshoots of my research will appear in the form of essays and articles in literary journals, art magazines and newspapers, as well as in the form of talks at museums and galleries. I hope that such publications and events will encourage a wider public debate about what is to be done with the ruins of the twentieth century.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>212913</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>(Penguin, forthcoming 2015)

It concerns the disappearance of an artist who has set out to explore the ruins, and the efforts of his partner to discover what happened.

I was commissioned by the Whitstable Biennale to curate an artists' film programme related to the Ruins of the 20th Century project. The programme, presented from 19 June to 4 July 2010, addressed the question of how artistic work concerned with ruination or destruction or decay could inform us about the nature of the contemporary. The artists whose work was shown were Bernd Behr, Gerard Byrne, Declan Clarke, Harun Farocki, Olivia Plender, Tom Dale, , Nina Katchadourian and Mie Olise.

The extent of contemporary artists' interest in the category of the ruin was found to be wider and more varied than the proposal allowed, and the subject was pursued in a critical anthology I edited, titled Ruins, for the Documents in Contemporary Art series published by MIT Press and the Whitechapel Gallery.



The project was at first envisaged as an effort to combine literary modes with a cultural history of ruins in Britain. Research into one of the key sites proposed at the outset, St Peter's Seminary in Scotland, led to the conclusion that a more strictly literary, more precisely fictional, mode was necessary in order to properly capture the specificity of the site and the sometimes obscure histories that attach to it. To that end, the first outcome of the project was a work of fiction: a novella entitled Sanctuary, published by Sternberg Press in 2011.



The question of a non-fictional mode for discussing modern ruins remained, though I had learned from the work on St Peter's that the project as a whole was best served by a written focus on the specifics of a sites or sites. The main non-fiction work is a book entitled Blown All to Nothing, concerning the explosion of a gunpowder works at Oare in Kent in April 1916: the form of writing here is considerably influenced by the fictional experiment in Sanctuary, and the book, to be published in 2013, may be considered a work of 'creative non-fiction', based on archival research, close study of the site and its environs, and imaginative reconstruction of the events in question.



The project has justified the proposal's statement that the ruin, and more specifically the modern ruin, is a key element in the cultural, aesthetic and political makeup of Britain in the early twentieth century. In the case of such sites as St Peter's and Oare, it exists at the juncture of the heritage industry, arts and redevelopment policy, and a more unofficial culture of exploration and appreciation of the ruin as such. It is clear that this is a topic that has more and more purchase on the public imagination as well as on the creative arts and heritage bodies. Work remains to be done on the broad cultural history of the ruin and modernity: the final outcome of the research undertaken will be an exhibition on ruins in British art to be held at Tate Britain, which I will curate.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The research and its outcomes (principally the four books and Tate exhibition) have consolidated and extended the field of research into ruins in art, literature and culture - my interdisciplinary approach, drawing on fiction, cultural history, art criticism and curatorial methods, may be applied to new geographical contexts (within our outside Britain) and to developments since the first outcomes were published: e.g., in twentieth-century heritage and contemporary art.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0F662B25-A233-4F39-A075-814846D22771</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-575861456.408967777952ff6</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1B096BDF-6451-40A7-920D-C52A335E3EEE</gtr:id><gtr:title>Ruins</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6928a8e82dbf7130dd13482d01072f1f"><gtr:id>6928a8e82dbf7130dd13482d01072f1f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dillon, Brian</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>0-262-51637-3</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>i_81176313733bf4bfe2</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3374D568-A48B-4969-AC36-6125A2B7E3C6</gtr:id><gtr:title>Sanctuary</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ea9c50f14d2050e54f7b5e76a7336c46"><gtr:id>ea9c50f14d2050e54f7b5e76a7336c46</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dillon, B</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-933128-87-0</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>i_36651347873c093e36</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/F015992/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DE53E60A-FE46-433C-BA16-151F707B335F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Creative Writing</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
