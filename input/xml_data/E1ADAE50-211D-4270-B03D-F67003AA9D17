Already, the synthetic biology market was worth &amp;pound;1.9 billion in 2013 and is expected to grow to around &amp;pound;10.6 billion by 2018 (Transparency Market Research (2012): Synthetic Biology Market, Global Industry Analysis, Size, Growth, Share and Forecast, 2012-2018). Within this market, there is an increasing need for new enabling technologies to help drive the research and development of future products.
The project proposed here intends to have a major impact on the global synthetic biology sector, in both the commercial market and in the rapidly-expanding academic research field, by providing a new enabling technology as a tool/service for screening and characterising engineered strains. This short project brings commercial microfluidics and mass spectrometry expertise together with academic excellence in synthetic biology to transform the way engineered microbial strains are screened and characterised when constructed using combinatorial design methods that yield construct libraries. Traditionally, screening of combinatorial libraries has been limited to engineered strains that incorporate fluorescence output into their design, radically limiting what products can be quickly screened-for. By bringing together microfluidics, mass spectrometry and synthetic biology, this project will develop a new enabling technology that does not require fluorescence to assess and sort thousands of engineered strains. This will impact synthetic biology and especially metabolic engineering projects, by opening-up new avenues where combinatorial designs can be tested without use of fluorescent proteins. Potentially, this could catalyse a step-change in the productivity of synthetic biology research and development, as design limitations will be significantly reduced. Further impact will be afforded by the greatermount of data that mass spectrometry produces per characterisation. Measurement by mass spectrometry reveals not only the quantity and quality of the product of an engineered strain but also provides a wealth of information on the health of the engineered strain, such as the energy availability (e.g. ATP/ADP ratios). These secondary data will be invaluable in selecting the most efficient engineered strains and will greatly inform future designs. The impact of switching from fluorescence-based characterisation to mass spectrometry-based characterisation has the potential to turn synthetic biology into a 'big data' science, where computation and prediction are enabled by rich datasets. Doing this using microfluidics also guarantees low-cost and affordability, making the technology developed in this project more likely to impact on a wider audience, both in academia and in industry.

At the point of the funding ending, the project was close to realising all of the aims of the proposal individually but not combined. Efforts by the lead company with their own funding look set to solve these last issues. We anticipate publishing the outcome of the project in late 2017 when the final challenges are solved.

The project has allowed us to study and construct libraries of synthetic pathways for the production of valuable products like the non-natural amino acids L-homoalanine and p-aminophenylalanine. We constructed an initial library with a more constrained level of diversity, combining rational design and randomized elements, but also a more complex and diverse library using a complete randomized strategy by a modular genetic assembly method (Golden gate Assembly). Sphere Fluidics, our partner in the project, is currently finishing the testing of a microfluidic high throughput-screening device that will allow the screening of the libraries using mass spectrometry analysis. Once the libraries are screened, and the best hits would be found, a genetic analysis of the devices assembled will be carried out to study the implication of the genetic construct over the production of these non-natural amino acids and how to improve the design. We are now both working with a large UK pharmaceutical company to give early impact to this research.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The lead company is now taking this forward as a commercial product</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D565FCD2-D5BF-4200-AED7-52CCB89789DA</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d6d8f77970d2.83345997</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/M005577/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>17F21DBC-4946-4262-AD07-9914F6EA12F7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Bioengineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FB535BD0-E265-4C0A-8532-32DCB83A3951</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tools, technologies &amp; methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>65492D16-92E6-408E-97CC-209D81D0EB7C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Bionanotechnology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>19C5179C-0522-47E8-82DA-48583B56264E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Metabolic engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3493671D-A4CF-4197-90A7-3CCFBE1C0627</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tools for the biosciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
