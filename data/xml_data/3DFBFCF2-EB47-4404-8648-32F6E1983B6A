Of the various objections to extending accommodation to Muslims I focus on the one that says the state should not be accommodating religions but simply ensuring freedom of belief. In so far as states like Britain already do more (eg. have 'established' churches) they should cease to do so not extend those arrangements to include Muslims. This is the radical secularist objection and I argue that it is based on a misunderstanding of the nature of political secularism in general and of specifically of the kind that exists in W. Europe, where the challenge of Muslim accommodation is most acute. I explore the different arrangements that constitute religion-state relations in key countries of western Europe (to date I have mostly focused on Britain) to identify the underlying norms and values and show that they constitute (a) distinctive form(s) of secularism and are reasonable. I elaborate the new multi-faith challenge to these arrangements, especially in relation to the accommodation of Muslims, including by scrutinising the claims that Muslims are making, and the ways in which governments, churches and publics are responding; and evaluate the normative and practical strengths and weaknesses of such accommodation and consider how they may be improved within a general perspective of civic multiculturalism. I aim to show that secularisms in the West are diverse and that this reasonable diversity is greater than that captured in much theorising. My purpose is to establish that some of the fear and conflict in relation to the claims-making of some Muslims in W. Europe is lessened as we realise that the political accommodation of Muslims in the W. Europe is not inconsistent with the 'really-existing-secularism' and does not require abandoning 'really-existing-secularism' in favour of 'post-secularism' or 'religious states'. More positively, it opens the way for new multiculturalist forms of secularism based on pluralized forms of accommodation rather than the privatisation of religion and the outlawing of state-religion interdependencies. This is then a project in contextualised political philosophy and I shall include a justification of this methodology. I shall use my leading public intellectual engagement profile in Britain in relation to issues of multiculturalism to use the work of this project in civil society and policy relevant arenas.\n\nI have about a quarter of a book in early draft and believe I can get a good draft of most of the rest done in a 12 months period working at 75% of time. I am seeking support from the AHRC for 9 months beginning 1 September, 2009 but will be able to continue for the subsequent three months (June - August, 2010) as it is a period with no teaching and light admin.\n\nI have applied for a fellowship at the Institute of Advanced Studies, Princeton but even if successful funding is not guaranteed and so I am applying to the AHRC, the Leverhulme Research Fellowships and the University of Bristol Fellowships in order to fund the book writing at Princeton or Bristol. I appreciate that I can only hold one of these and that is my goal.\n\nProfessor David Miller, the Director of Centre for the Study of Social Justice, a research cluster of political philosophers and theorists at the University of Oxford, has agreed to propose me as a Visiting Fellow for 2010-11. There is no stipend with this post and will only entail a limited number of visits to Oxford, primarily so I can discuss my ideas with a group of political philosophers I am familiar with.\n\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>It is difficult to achieve impact even with the best of intentions and plans. One of the best indicators of impact is past record; and one of the best, indeed unsubstitutable bases of public impact is a high public intellectual engagement profile. On both these counts my ability to make public impact with this project/book is considerable. \n\nI am one of - probably amongst the top three - publicly engaged academics in Britain in relation to policy and political controversies on issues to do with racial equality, multiculturalism and the accommodation of Muslims. I have always maintained some critical distance from policy-makers, preferring to work through public debate and Commissions rather than as an adviser in or secondee to Whitehall. In this way I have played a critical role in helping academics and non-academics understand the transformations in minority-majority relations from 'race' to 'multiculturalism' to 'religion' in relation to sociological developments, the emergence of Muslim identity politics, and their normative and policy implications. I have for example done many presentations to seminars organised by racial egalitarians, think-tanks and Ministers on the need to extend legislation to cover religious discrimination and religious hatred and have engaged in media and civil society debates on topics such as the Rushdie Affair, the Danish Cartoons, the Archbishop of Canterbury's speech on incorporating 'sharia' into English law and so on.\n\nI have already presented some of my initial ideas from this book to The Fabian Society, to a conference where the Archbishop of Canterbury was present, to seminars organised by the Equality and Human Rights Commission and the Policy Research Centre of the Islamic Foundation (who are publishing one of my essays, together with a response by me to prominent policy critics) and debated it on television (France 24 - available on the web). I have had the gratification to see my ideas referred to by non-academics, some of whom are explicitly using them to promote a sympathetic approach to religion in the public square. The Institute of Public Policy Research (ippr), the largest British thinktank, have appointed me to their Advisory Council, so I am input my work into their strategic thinking. I am a regular contributor to The Guardian, to Radio 4 and the website OpenDemocracy and shall use these fora as well as all the invitations I regularly get from various governmental and civil society organisations to present my work and to debate the issues.\n\nI shall also approach some religion-specific NGOs to discuss dissemination. I have a relationship of many years' with the Inter-Faith Network for the UK and am working with Churches' Commission for Migrants in Europe (CCME), Brussels on an EU project involving 15 countries on Toleration and Diversity. I have extensive contacts with Muslim organisations and will also draw on those.\n\nEngagement, then, consists of thinking through and publicly engaging on difficult political questions, using the opportunity of controversies and crises to intervene and present my views in an accessible language and above all to raise the level of the debate so that it is better informed and addresses what I think are the key questions.\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>72221</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Georgetown University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:department>Berkley Centre</gtr:department><gtr:description>Workshop organised by The Berkeley Centre, Georgetown University</gtr:description><gtr:id>01FDA2BF-5A1E-42CC-9227-92B3A43175B4</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b95d5656b95d566a-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>I participated in the Workshop on Navigating Religion in World Affairs: the US and UK Compared, organised by The Berkeley Centre, Georgetown University and held at Oxford University, 21-21 January, 2011 with a view to identifying research topics for trans-Atlantic collaboration.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Institute of Human Sciences, Vienna</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Austria, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Visiting Fellow at the Institute of Human Sciences, Vienna</gtr:description><gtr:id>E513D97B-9EFA-432C-B5A7-53408B1C710B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b95c3280b95c329e-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>I was a Visiting Fellow at the Institute of Human Sciences, Vienna for the month of June, 2011 as part of its Religion and Secularism programme led by Charles Taylor and participated for the second time in the Programme?s annual conference.

More specifically I have focused on two 'pathways to impact':

1. During 2013-2015 I worked on the Commission on Religion and Belief in British Public Life (CORAB), on which I am one of the Steering Group Commissioners, and which published its report in December, 2015. I have contributed to the writing of the report and the report cites my work:
http://www.corab.org.uk/

2. In June 2015 I co-authored a Stimulus Paper with Professor Craig Calhoun (Director, LSE) for the Leadership Foundation in HE, Religion in Britain: Challenges for Higher Education:
https://www.lfhe.ac.uk/en/research-resources/publications/index.cfm/ModoodST30

I am in discussion with the LHFE, the Equalities Challenge Unit and a number of universities about how to turn some of the ideas of the paper into equality and diversity strategies and to improve religious literacy.

Political secularism in Britain, and more generally Western Europe, has been destabilised, in particular the historical flow from a moderate to radical secularism and the expectation of its continuation has been jolted. This is not because of any Christian desecularisation or a 'return of the repressed'. Rather, the jolt is created by the triple contingency of:
i) the arrival and settlement of a significant number of Muslims; 
ii) a multiculturalist sensibility which respects 'difference'; 
iii) and a moderate secularism, namely that the historical compromises between the state and a church or churches in relation to public recognition and accommodation are still in place to some extent. 
To speak of a 'crisis of secularism' is highly exaggerated, especially in relation to the state, indeed it is misleading. It is true that the challenge is profound for laicite or radical secularism as an ideology, but the problem is more defined by issues of post-immigration integration than by the religion-state relation per se. Far from this entailing the end of secularism as we know it, moderate secularism offers some of the resources for accommodating Muslims. 

Each country in Western Europe is a secular state and while each has its own distinctive take on what this means, nevertheless, there is a general historical character, which I call moderate secularism, and a lesser strand. The latter is principally manifested in French laicite, which seeks to create a public space in which religion is virtually banished in the name of reason and emancipation, and religious organisations are monitored by the state through consultative national mechanisms. The main western European approach, however, sees organised religion as a potential public good or national resource (not just a private benefit), which the state can in some circumstances assist to realise - even through an 'established' church. These public benefits can be direct such as a contribution to education and social care through autonomous church-based organisations funded by the taxpayer; or indirect, such as the production of attitudes that create economic hope or family stability; and they can be to do with national identity, cultural heritage, ethical voice and national ceremonies.

 By multiculturalism I mean not just the fact of new ethno-religious diversity but the presence of a multiculturalist approach to this diversity, namely: the idea that equality must be extended from uniformity of treatment to include respect for difference; recognition of public/private interdependence rather than dichotomized as in classical liberalism; the public recognition and institutional accommodation of minorities; the reversal of marginalisation and a remaking of national citizenship so that all can have a sense of belonging to it. This could be said to be a form of 'equalising upwards, not downwards', and so in relation to religion can mean accommodating religious groups such as Muslims without dispossessing Christians. We could describe this as a multiculturalism in which religion is one of a number of valued identities and forms of social organisation, and recognised as such in a public and political way without being uniquely privileged. 

Political secularists should think pragmatically and institutionally on how to achieve this, namely how to multiculturalise moderate secularism, and avoid exacerbating the crisis and limiting the room for manoeuvre, by pressing for further, radical secularism.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>To do some further thinking about contemporary secularism in Western Europe and how it can be adapted to accommodate Muslims.
