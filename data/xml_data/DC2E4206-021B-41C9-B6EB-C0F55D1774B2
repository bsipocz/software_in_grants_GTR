The research will help forge complementary regional partnerships between the two universities and with Nottingham City Council and local heritage organisations who, with the wider community, will be the main non-academic beneficiaries of the project.

For the partner organisations it will facilitate hands-on experience of research, engagement with a rich field of knowledge, and create opportunities for knowledge exchange. Participants in a Gateway to Nature Framework project conference (which encourages involvement in green and nature-related activities for vulnerable members of the community) held in Nottingham in October 2012, stated that they were partly inspired by the historic ethos of Nottingham's green spaces. The project aims to capitalise on such community-led initiatives to raise awareness of the historic importance of green spaces and their surrounding communities, challenging both local people and visitors to the city to value and utilise them even more for recreation, education, research and scholarship. Through the development of networks and exchange of experiences it hopes to ameliorate tensions between preservation, heritage and community demands such as those demonstrated recently when one group concerned with preserving the Forest's heritage clashed with community groups wanting improved sports facilities.

The City Council faces many challenges managing and preserving Nottingham's historic green spaces which are used by diverse groups with different needs and expectations. It will benefit from the project in two ways. First, the project will build on and expand existing relationships with community groups and improve communication. Second, as part of a programme to promote understanding of Nottingham's historic green spaces, and inspire interest in their varied history, the project will provide a context for understanding the diverse landscapes including the planting schemes, the original buildings and the other structures, and how they are used. In a period of financial austerity and local government budget reductions, it will provide a useful source of information and inspiration for the work of gardeners, rangers and other parks staff, who are active in the friends groups, and aid the landscape-gardening, planting and management of Nottingham green spaces.

For local communities and local cultural consciousness, the project will enhance the sense of belonging and well-being implied in connecting the city with its green spaces, and provide the urban community with a cultural resource. For the wider community, the project will contribute to the regeneration ambitions of Nottingham City Council which rely on the active participation of local and regional leaders in the public and private sector. Overtures to these leaders to discuss the results of the project will secure lasting impact because of their resulting contribution to city planning and policy making. As well as providing the benefits of new knowledge for the wider community, it will create potential for economic benefit in the region through tourism. By placing Nottingham's Victorian parks, gardens, cemeteries and public walks into the context of the city's industrial and urban history, the intention is to build on and link to the city's wider regeneration strategy, which links directly to its tourism and heritage strategy, including regeneration of the Castle Quarter; Professor Beckett is a member of the working group preparing a major HLF bid for this area.

In these various ways, the project will have an impact among conservationists, heritage and museum specialists, local history enthusiasts, and people interested in the wider aspects of landscape design, conservation and history, not least some of the thousands of contemporary users of historic green spaces.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The main economic and societal impacts will be in the Nottingham region, largely realised through the vehicle of the partner organisations.

The City Council faces many challenges managing and preserving Nottingham's historic green spaces which are used by diverse groups with different needs and expectations. Recently the Friends of the Forest have clashed with community groups wanting improved sports facilities. In itself this demonstrates the tensions between preservation, heritage and community demands. Yet there are many encouraging signs that parks and open spaces are appreciated by the local urban community. Participants in a Gateway to Nature Framework project conference in Nottingham in October 2012, for instance, which encourages involvement in green and nature related activities for vulnerable members of the community, stated that they were partly inspired by the historic ethos of Nottingham's green spaces.

For local communities and local cultural consciousness, the project will enhance the sense of belonging, and well-being implied in connecting the city with its green spaces, providing the urban community with a cultural resource.

By embedding knowledge and the development of the history of the green spaces formed at enclosure, the project will provide a context for understanding the varied landscapes including the planting schemes, the original buildings and the other structures. In a period of financial austerity and local government budget reductions, it will provide a useful source of information and inspiration for the work of gardeners, rangers and other parks staff, who are active in the friends groups, with their landscape-gardening, planting and management of Nottingham green spaces.

Paul Elliott gave a talk The Greening of Nottingham 1840-1880 which explained the town council's commitment to tree planting during the 19th century. The Arboretum is the 'jewel in the crown' of this endeavour, but the Council also ensure that trees were a focus for the other green spaces created by the 1845 Enclosure Act. This enthusiasm spilt over into 'street trees' and tree planting in private gardens. Paul's talk was followed by a brief presentation by Judith Mills on the follow-on project's public engagement activities. 
The very wet weather meant that the audience was smaller than normal.

The class then talked about the range of trees and the type of birds kept in the Arboretum which involved a discussion about continents. 
Afterwards the children cut out and decorated some cardboard birds. Some children took their work home, but others donated it to the project and it was hung in one of the Aviaries while Breathing Spaces was being performed.
The aim was to introduce young children in the area to some of the history associated with their local parks, and also raise awareness amongst teachers of these potential educational resources. The workshops also helped to promote the project's activities, especially the specially commissioned play, Breathing Spaces.

The workshops also helped to promote the project's activities, especially Breathing Spaces.

Organised by creative writing tutor and lecturer Angela Foxwood, 30 children from a local primary school attended a workshop. The workshop began with a brief history lesson about how the appearance of Nottingham has changed over the past 300 years, with particular attention paid to the enclosure of earlier green spaces and the establishment and preservation of Nottingham's historical green spaces as a result of the 1845 Enclosure Act. 

The school children were then shown a selection of photographs and paintings of Nottingham's parks through the ages. These images were used as prompts for them to write short poems or other short pieces of imaginative writing inspired by the images and the history of the parks.

Many of the poems/writings were selected and added, along with the images and a timeline to create a large tapestry. This tapestry was then included as part of the project's public exhibition in Nottingham Local Studies Library during August 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b058c5978fe0.87645519</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Exhibition: Nottingham's Historic Green Spaces</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>73AABA8C-F606-4D0D-B36D-3556796679D5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Nottingham's Historic Green Spaces Exhibition was held in the public exhibition space in the Nottingham Central Library, adjacent to the Local Studies Library. It ran from 3-30 August 2016. It was officially opened by Paddy Tipping, Police Commissioner for Nottinghamshire.
The exhibition comprised 
? a series of illustrated panels describing the creation and use of Nottingham's Historic Green Spaces
? two panels illustrating some of the project's engagement activities
? display cases holding related artefacts from the Local Studies Library collection
? ten short 'talking-heads' films featuring characters (e.g. park keeper, war widow, sportsman) who related aspects of the history of the green spaces.
In parallel there were talks by project members (Paul Elliott and Jonathan Coope), a children's games workshop, and a workshop specifically for services users of Framework's Nature in Mind programme. The project team also gave presentations to the Nottinghamshire Local History Associations 'Angel Row Forum' event which was held in the exhibition space.
Interest in the exhibition resulted in a 20 minute interview on Radio Nottingham, a double-page spread in the Nottingham Post and several requests for talks to local history or community groups.

Co-produced archival research, and preparation for co-authored publications, expected in 2015-16. The research fellows worked with, and advised and trained, community groups at Nottinghamshire Archives and at Nottingham Local Studies Library. The research results are now being collated for publication. Interactive discussion via website: www.ng-spaces.org.uk This is still being updated, and further findings will be posted.
2. The value of reaching out to, and working with, local community partners, to create new networks both informally and through the Nottingham Contemporary event held on 18 January. Presentations were made both by team members and also by individuals, and individuals on behalf of community groups. A feedback session was held at the end of the day which pointed to a new way of thinking about the green spaces on the part of the community groups, notably on the issue of the contestation of space.
3. Unexpected but distinctive linkages with local community groups, particularly Green Activists, with local history enthusiasts who came to appreciate the degree of common interest they had in researching historic green spaces.
4. Bringing together of an academic audience and community group members in a conference held at the University of Nottingham on 10 January 2014. Papers were presented by academics from various universities, and large audience of non-academic researchers from the local community groups both attended and engaged in discussion. The linkage between the two groups worked better than we had anticipated and showed important synergies between community groups researching and working at the local level and academic specialists.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Information prepared for and submitted to Nottingham City Council for information panels in the Arboretum.
The website was created and maintained throughout the project, and has been extended for at least one year beyond its official close in February 2014: www.ng-spaces.org.uk
A number of publications are in preparation as a result of activities on the project, in which an academic or a research fellow is working with a community group or individual to co-produce publications.
Follow-on funding proposal for a dissemination project targeted at a non-academic audience particularly the BME communities who lived adjacent to the green spaces which have been part of the initial project. To include a day school, youth group drama workshop and videos, permanent and temporary exhibitions and exhibition materials.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E1DF7E08-5247-4BEB-A031-51C614F46C94</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5457acd6c14327.29135993</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.ng-spaces.org.uk</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1D0F1808-8C64-45F3-BD1C-0868CE084FDD</gtr:id><gtr:title>Reflections on a co-production project: the story of the Social World of Nottingham's Green Spaces project</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Local Historian</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ae766fdfa833f537748dae64f078ada9"><gtr:id>ae766fdfa833f537748dae64f078ada9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Coope J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>5457b1b4c1d8c5.07893375</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F031F82B-A080-46A6-B78E-64C1C4E54DD1</gtr:id><gtr:title>The transformation of green space in Old and New Nottingham</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Transactions of the Thoroton Society</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/688161bc2b4d723f0f2c76fca4504710"><gtr:id>688161bc2b4d723f0f2c76fca4504710</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mills, J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>569f9755dc0f87.01635536</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5F9330B6-CAB8-4645-BA14-19E52F9F8222</gtr:id><gtr:title>British Urban Trees: a Social and Cultural History</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7f6c4b6d19ea96f596eef580d0c085c9"><gtr:id>7f6c4b6d19ea96f596eef580d0c085c9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Elliott P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>569d07ca2dff10.03064338</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>94743902-4AC1-4AD5-8846-4F100BEAAA30</gtr:id><gtr:title>People's Parks: Victorian Urban Public Parks in the West Midlands</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>History West Midlands</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7f6c4b6d19ea96f596eef580d0c085c9"><gtr:id>7f6c4b6d19ea96f596eef580d0c085c9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Elliott P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>569d0852cc5412.97994498</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3956334E-8B3F-456E-8120-431EA80D8467</gtr:id><gtr:title>Victorian Gardening, horticulture and arboriculture in the Midlands: John Frederick Wood (1806-65) of Nottingham and the Midland Florist and Suburban Horticulturalist</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Transactions of the Thoroton Society</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7f6c4b6d19ea96f596eef580d0c085c9"><gtr:id>7f6c4b6d19ea96f596eef580d0c085c9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Elliott P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>569d0914691013.04073647</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/K007718/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DCE73056-5E3D-4976-B573-234E5FF4D633</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic &amp; Social History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
