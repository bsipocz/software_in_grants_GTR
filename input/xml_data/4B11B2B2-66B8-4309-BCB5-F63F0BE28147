The skin has an inbuilt immune system that acts as a defence against dangerous insults such as infectious microorganisms; it is apparent that a weakening of this defence may lead to adverse health effects. One important cell involved in the skin immune response is the Langerhans? cell (LC), the outermost sentinel of the body?s immune system. In aged skin there is both a reduction in the number of LC and in their ability to function normally. This study will explore whether age-related decline of the skin?s immune defences is due to changes in the signals responsible for maintaining normal LC function and/or changes in LC themselves. An integrated approach will be adopted working closely with clinical and non-clinical scientists to maximise the translational aspects of this work in humans. A more detailed understanding of LC function in aged human skin will provide a wider appreciation of ageing of the immune response in other tissues and organs that are less easily accessed for this type of investigation, and will identify ways to reduce and/or delay the age related decline in skin immune function.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Background: With increasing age aspects of the innate and adaptive immune systems show functional decline. In the skin this is associated with an increased incidence of epidermal malignancies and infections, a decreased incidence of contact allergy (type IV hypersensitivity), and the development of autoimmunity. The mechanisms underlying these clinical effects in aged skin are poorly understood. Langerhans? cells (LC), members of the wider family of dendritic cells (DC), reside in the epidermis where they act as sentinels of the immune system by processing and presenting antigen and inducing T cell responses. Previous investigations have suggested that the number of epidermal LC is reduced, and the motility of LC is impaired, in aged skin and that this latter phenomenon is associated with a defect in interleukin 1? (IL-1?) signalling. 

Hypothesis: In aged skin the observed deficit in LC number and trafficking is mediated by a perturbation in IL-1?-dependent mechanisms 

Aims: To determine the mechanistic basis for the reduced frequency and restricted mobility of epidermal LC in the skin of the elderly

Objectives: This proposal will investigate at the cellular and molecular levels the mechanisms through which the frequency and function of LC are perturbed in ageing skin, and on that basis explore opportunities through which LC activity and cutaneous immune function may be restored through clinical intervention. 

Design/Methods: This translational programme of work will address a series of questions relating to LC biology in aged human skin. The research will embrace both molecular and cellular biology. I will perform analyses of circulating and cutaneous DC coupled with a detailed assessment of relevant skin cytokines, and in particular IL-1?. The cytokine assessments will be performed both in the baseline state and following stimulation of LC achieved via intradermal cytokine injection and exposure to a contact allergen. I will also conduct a clinical sdy to assess the effect of a topical retinoid on LC biology in aged skin.

Scientific and Medical Opportunities: A more detailed understanding of the mechanisms through which increasing age impacts upon the cutaneous immune system may inform our broader understanding of the ageing process in other tissues and organs that are less easily accessed for this type of investigation. This knowledge will facilitate development of preventative strategies and targeted therapies to delay and/or reverse age related impairment in LC function and skin immune responses.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-05-05</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-10-06</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>202949</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>THESIS meeting</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3C93447D-AA30-43EA-817A-51D663F1C1C0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>40 dermatology trainees attended a 2 day meeting to learn about individuals experience of research and how to plan a research project.
