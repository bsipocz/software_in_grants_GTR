There were plagues and wars, perilous childbirths and shocking infant mortality. But what risks did people face as they went about their everyday lives?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Thousands of coroner's inquest reports on accidental deaths preserved at The National Archives allow us to investigate. These reports cover almost the whole of England, town and country, young and old, men and women, rich and poor. They tell us about working practices in farming, industry and housework and about leisure activities such as football, swimming, bell-ringing and riverside flower-picking, even the risks of getting too close to performing bears. They show contrasts between men's and women's lives, between different agricultural regions, between different times of day and seasons of the year. They show changes across the century, such as the replacement of archery by guns. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>Classified into an accessible database, contextualised through targeted research on other documents, explored in a book and publicised in other ways, they will provide vivid insights into daily life irrecoverable from other records, lessons about the changes that have made life safer or more dangerous in the intervening centuries, and new ways to investigate social change and social variation in sixteenth-century England.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>349347</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>We presented our research on domestic accidents in sixteenth-century England as part of this BBC4 documentary, first shown on 20 January 2015 and repeated thereafter.</gtr:description><gtr:id>304F32CD-AB95-443D-8B6E-1B8D7132F2BE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Several reviews of the programme (e.g. Telegraph, Independent) noted the evidence of our research in their discussion of the programme and the BBC iWonder website used four accidents from our project website 'Discovery of the Month' section for their supporting 'How could you survive in Tudor England' feature.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5659dabcbea659.46975727</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Hidden Killers of the Tudor Home</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/guides/z8r49j6</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Exeter</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of History</gtr:department><gtr:description>Women's work project</gtr:description><gtr:id>3B421B68-851F-4128-A896-8BA6CA83AC14</gtr:id><gtr:impact>No outcomes yet as the project has just started.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>565a198245ae64.11454639-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The project team's research on other sources for women's work will help to set our evidence from coroners' inquests in context.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We are sharing all our data on women's working accidents with the Leverhulme-funded project on 'Women's work in rural England 1500-1700: a new methodological approach', based at the University of Exeter, PI Jane Whittle, and Steven Gunn is sitting on that project's advisory board.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Cambridge</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Occupational Structure and Living Standards</gtr:description><gtr:id>E8F89179-5340-4A89-A2A0-5B1BC84D8603</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr Gromelski has been included as a full-time named researcher in applications to the Leverhulme Trust for funding for each project.

Fifty-one returned questionnaires (including 9 employed or self-employed, 39 retired and one member of staff at a university). The average rating given on the question 'To what extent did the lecture increase your awareness of everyday life in the sixteenth century' was 4.1/5. 27 commented on particular aspects of daily life on which their perspective or opinion had been altered, such as the prevalence of drowning (2), the variety of leisure activities (3), the lives of children (2), guns and traffic (1 each). 28 specified aspects of daily life about which they would have liked to hear more, such as women's lives and the importance of the landscape, thus helping to shape the future focus and presentation of the research. 28 said they would take action as a result of the talk, such as attending more history lectures or joining a local history group (14), reading more about the subject (7), or being more careful of their own safety (2).

Material on the BBC website, on BBC national and local radio stations, Radio New Zealand and Newstalk Ireland radio programmes and in newspapers has had the largest public reach. Our findings on the drowning while picking flowers of Jane Shaxspere, possibly a cousin of William, reached 246 websites in at least 20 countries from Mexico to Iran within a day of its appearance on the BBC site. A follow-up feature on '10 strange ways Tudors died' spent 22 hours amongst the site's ten most read stories. Our research on football deaths attracted stories in the Times and Telegraph and on the Daily Mail website, and radio interviews on Talksport FM and Italk FM. Our archery deaths have featured in Horrible Histories and football, archery and bell-ringing on Have I Got News for You.
More extended coverage of our work came in BBC4's Hidden Killers of the Tudor Home. This programme used our material on house collapses, archery, wrestling, and bear attacks, but above all emphasized drownings, putting the presenter in a pond in Tudor clothes to show why water was so dangerous. In connection with the programme, findings from our project website's 'Discovery of the Month' feature were used in the BBC iWonder section on 'How could you survive in Tudor England'.
Articles in BBC History Magazine, in The Lancet and in the Polish popular history magazine M&amp;oacute;wia wieki have enabled us to explore particular themes for a general historical readership: the dangers of water and animals, Tudor understanding of physiology and death, children's games and the impact of the Reformation.
Public lectures have enabled us to explain our findings in more depth to a wide variety of audiences. We have spoken to school students, school teachers and museum visitors, local history societies and Historical Association and Workers' Educational Association groups, across England from Devon to Yorkshire. The reach of several of these talks, for example that linking accidental deaths to everyday Tudor objects in the Ashmolean Museum, has been amplified by podcasting. Questionnaire returns and social media responses have shown that we have consistently re-shaped people's understanding of everyday life in the sixteenth century, encouraged them to investigate Tudor England in more detail, and inspired teachers and National Trust volunteers to pass on their increased awareness to others.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>5BB31AEF-B5BF-4ACE-A181-229BB7FFE682</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>546256598c2a01.37052323</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have established the utility of sixteenth-century coroners' inquest reports on accidental deaths for exploring the history of early modern English society in four main ways.
First, they can be used to investigate large-scale issues in social, economic and cultural history. These include the age at which children began work and the types of work they did; the characteristic nature and dangers of women's work, particularly fetching water; the effects on home and working life of various disabilities; the habit of sleeping in a wide range of places and at many times of day; the prevalence of open-water bathing by working men in high summer; the very wide social range of people who rode horses; the greater incidence of fatal house collapses than fatal house fires; the rapid spread of firearms towards the end of the century; and the habitual times and locations for different sports and recreations. These topics have generated most of our research collaborations.
Second, they can be used to reconstruct everyday life in particular communities, from the general, for example the life of Newcastle as a busy port and entertainment centre, to the particular: bull-baiting in Selby, Palm Sunday cake-throwing at Chippenham, pottery-making at Low Toynton, scythe-making at Belbroughton. They include a large number of names of fields, woods, hills, watercourses and roads. They reveal communal activities from bell-ringing to road repair, provide frequent details of arrest and imprisonment and shed light on the working life and inter-relationships of servants in households. Much of our public outreach and knowledge exchange work has concentrated on these themes. 
Third, they can be used to reconstruct working practices in particular crafts and areas of agriculture. They preserve technical terms sometimes hundreds of years before their first mention elsewhere: springles for thatching, grigweels for eel-trapping, and so on. They show the times of year and times of day at which particular work was done. They show the characteristic dangers of activities such as scything, tree-felling and washing sheep before shearing and the steps taken to minimise them. They show the risks run by those using machinery of different sorts, from watermills, windmills and cider presses to the many carts that brought fatal traffic accidents long before the motor car. Similar practicalities can be investigated for sports, drama and even religious worship.
Fourth, they can be used to reconstruct the lives and deaths of individuals great and small in otherwise inaccessible detail. The social span of those to whom the reports give us access ranges from beggars dying of exposure on moors through drunk women returning from market, minstrels juggling with daggers, labourers frolicking in haystacks and apprentices fooling about with the charcoal on top of blast furnaces, to gentlemen reading prayer books on crumbling clifftops and little George, Lord Dacre, trying to adjust his wooden vaulting-horse and causing its collapse. These cameos have occupied some of our more popular publications and will be combined with the larger themes in the book we are writing to present our findings.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We anticipate that our findings will be taken forward in three main ways. Once we have completed analysis of all the reports we have photographed, we shall write a book exploring the many different aspects of daily life in sixteenth-century England on which the reports shed light. Once our complete spreadsheet of the data contained in the reports is available through UK data service and our university website, other historians of early modern England will be able to use the data to investigate questions other than those we have explored, as those involved in the women's work project, for example, have already begun to do. And once the availability of the data is publicised by our book and other means, local and family historians will be able to use it to investigate the history of particular communities, families and individuals.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E81E2FF1-7084-478F-BC84-5BE38BC09047</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5462291ad7a8a2.61695952</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://tudoraccidents.modhist.ox.ac.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>This database contains details of the first 6,000 accident reports we have analysed</gtr:description><gtr:id>F822A9A0-2174-4426-AFFC-B53B6F5F7EF9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Impacts are anticipated once the database is deposited with UK data service; the audience at lectures we have given have often enquired about its future availability and use.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56796f749a07e8.53266414</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>First deposit accidents spreadsheet</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>946E2B33-A9AF-40CA-BAB8-4B2B9E836440</gtr:id><gtr:title>The perils of piety in Tudor England</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>BBC History Magazine</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/74ad82fbdc2930f89406f6438a7b50c3"><gtr:id>74ad82fbdc2930f89406f6438a7b50c3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gunn, S.
