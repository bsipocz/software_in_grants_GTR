Yet much of the evidence on which this view is based is derived from old data which fails to recognise the extraordinary pace of social change that has taken place in recent decades. Today there are far more lone parents than before and lone-parenthood is an increasingly diverse and fluid state.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project will look at how the circumstances of lone parent families and their children has changed, and at the impact of lone parenthood on the trajectories of parents and children, using birth cohort data for those born in 1958, 1970 and 2000. It will ask:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>How does the experience of lone-parenthood change the trajectories of parents and children?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Are there a set of &amp;quot;typical&amp;quot; routes into lone parenthood that can be identified?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Do these routes matters for parent and child outcomes?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Finally it will address the question of whether lone- parenthood is becoming an increasingly diverse experience, with some mothers doing well and others struggling to avoid poverty and benefit dependency?&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Lone parenthood, poverty and child development has remained a key dimension of social policy research for at least 25 years and remains central to the current government's objectives around child poverty and social mobility. This project will achieve a step-change in advancing our understanding about the changing nature of lone parenthood, its diversity and association with child outcomes and will be of substantial benefit to policy makers in the government as it seeks to improve equality of opportunity in Britain. To date the influence of family structure on social mobility has been missing from the policy agenda and little evidence exists to support policy in this area. We therefore would expect the work to be of significant interest to the newly established Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission. We would also anticipate communicating our findings to officials at the DWP and Treasury. The findings would also be of considerable interest to non-government organizations such as Gingerbread, Child Poverty Action Group, and the Single Parents Action Network. We will actively engage in ensuring the research findings reach these groups, as outlined in our Pathways to Impact statement. Social Policy at Bath and the Centre for Market and Public Organisation at Bristol (where Gregg and Harkness are associates) have outstanding reputations for high quality research, dissemination and for fostering wider impact. Recognition of the impact of research work at Bath on policy and practice is evidenced by its recent award of the prestigious Queen's Anniversary Award for Higher and Further Education. The award to Bath cited our ''Influential research into child poverty and support for vulnerable people'. This specifically included our research on lone parenthood and on children and poverty. 

We will stage a major conference toward the end of the project to address a broad audience. This will be in London and we will seek to invite other major researchers on family structure, poverty and children's life chances from the UK and abroad. This will provide a key opportunity both for influencing policy makers and getting the research out into the public domain. We would seek to get charities and campaign groups such as Gingerbread and Child Poverty Action Group to engage in this conference ant to involve policy makers, such as Alan Milburn (the poverty and social mobility Tsar), and senior civil servants from the Treasury, Department for Work and Pensions and the Department for Education. We would anticipate producing a short briefing paper for this event which we would disseminate to selected policy makers, MPs, NGOs and the press.

The project will exploit Gregg, Harkness and Millar's extensive links to, and experience of working with, policy makers and practitioners to ensure impact (see also the impact statement and attached CVs). In addition to the briefing paper produced for the launch we will also produce a number of briefing papers aimed at different audiences such as employers groups or single parents. To achieve wider dissemination we would hope to produce an article for the ESRC's &amp;quot;Britain in 2014&amp;quot; and for the CMPO's &amp;quot;Research in Public Policy&amp;quot; bulletin. We will maintain a project websites and will post all outputs alongside a blog and podcast on the findings. We would anticipate having press releases around conferences and/or publication of the research, in conjunction with the University of Bath and CMPO press officers.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-12-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>157496</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Observer / Society Central</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8E2A3AEA-6874-4FF7-9FC7-D2A0D2D9351A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>An article for Society Central was written.

Our research was conducted in two parts. First, using used data from the 1958, 1970 and 2000 birth cohort studies we examined changes in family structures and how they affected children's outcomes. Second we used more recent panel data from the British Household Panel Survey to track women over time to see how becoming a lone mother influenced their economic circumstances. 

Lone Mother Families

One-in-three children born in 2000 spent some time with a lone mother by age 11, three times as many as in 1958. Many of these children experienced lone parenthood early, one-in-ten being born to a lone mother and a further quarter experiencing lone parenthood before age five. 

Over time lone motherhood became increasingly correlated with socio-economic characteristics with young mothers and the less-educated particularly likely to become lone mothers. This has increased inequalities in the parental and economic resources available to children in lone parent families and those living with two biological parents. 

Lone Motherhood and Economic Outcomes

Low employment rates, earnings and incomes observed among lone mothers are partly explained by the high economic cost of motherhood; partly by &amp;quot;selection&amp;quot; into lone motherhood; and by the absence of a partner's potential earnings. Low rates of employment among lone mothers' are not found to be caused by lone motherhood per se. Instead lone mothers behave like those with partners, with first-time motherhood leading to large reductions in employment and earnings and lone motherhood having little additional effect. 
For all families the birth of a child is associated with falling income, mainly as a result of decreased female earnings. Those that became lone mothers through separation see further falls in income because of losses in partner's earning, this fall being of similar magnitude to that associated with first-time parenthood. 

We conclude that addressing the problem of lone mothers' economic disadvantage will require policy makers to address the high economic cost of motherhood as later intervention are at a point where much of the damage to women's economic circumstances has already occurred. 

Children's Outcomes

On average children who experience lone motherhood have poorer cognitive outcomes than those who grow up with both biological parents, gaps in attainment being larger the earlier lone motherhood occurs. Using information on the characteristics of parents and children observed before parents split or, for those who are single at birth, at birth we assess the extent to which these gaps result from lone motherhood. Characteristics explain a large share of this gap although a difference remains. There is a great deal of heterogeneity between children. In particular children in lone mother families whose mothers have poor mental health or financial difficulties have particularly poor cognitive outcomes, while those whose mothers have aspirations for their children and establish routines fare better. Lone parenthood in the past was associated with a deterioration in parenting - lone motherhood for example was associated with less authoritative parenting, more maternal depression and fewer educational aspirations. Today that difference has all but disappeared and these differences cannot account for the gap in attainment between children in lone parent families and those with two parents. The deterioration of children's economic status following lone parenthood makes a much more significant contribution to attainment gaps. 
Finally our results suggest that the largest negative effects of lone parenthood are seen for more able children who under-perform relative to their high-ability peers in intact families. 

We currently have 3 papers from the project under review at leading journals and 2 forthcoming book chapters. We anticipate publication in 2016/17.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings of the project are of interest to government and NGOs such as Gingerbread. We have presented the findings on children's outcomes at the British Academy to policy and practitioner audience. The DWP team working on the Family Stability Review and Child Poverty and Social Mobility Commission have been in contact about this work. It is also of interest to the Scottish government. We will also be sharing our findings with Gingerbread (who have attended seminars where this work has been presented) and hope that this may influence their service provision and campaigns.

The research has opened up several potential areas for new research. In particular we would like to extend our current work to examine reasons for the growth in lone parenthood, and why it has become increasingly common among particular groups and at intergenerational patterns using data on the children of the 1970 cohort members. Second, we would like to extend our work using the MCS. To date, because we have comparing children across cohorts and therefore restricted our analysis to variables that are comparable across time, we have not yet fully exploited this data. In particular we would like to explore the information on father involvement and its relationship with child outcomes.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>22D720F6-D9B4-487F-99B4-120CE12EE71A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54cbf1381fdb17.00556519</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4A7EF20B-A4ED-450F-8CE4-1AB822F44DE4</gtr:id><gtr:title>Routes into lone motherhood and its socio-economic consequences</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b8a9ef66f8c40a0eabe818376afa3db3"><gtr:id>b8a9ef66f8c40a0eabe818376afa3db3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Harkness, Susan</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>56e02749561052.07177462</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>094B7904-1EEB-4368-AA78-25580BD206E1</gtr:id><gtr:title>Routes into lone motherhood and its socio-economic consequences</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b8a9ef66f8c40a0eabe818376afa3db3"><gtr:id>b8a9ef66f8c40a0eabe818376afa3db3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Harkness, Susan</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>56e02801629110.64144629</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F7E53392-487A-4D34-A85C-EF9F32F69750</gtr:id><gtr:title>Lone Motherhood and Children's Cognitive Outcomes</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/1c66173903344c7667b0ac851e0828c4"><gtr:id>1c66173903344c7667b0ac851e0828c4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Harkness, S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c019d83ce769.73154289</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8B85323C-8B42-49CA-9D66-0078BA676FA0</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Effect of Motherhood and Lone Motherhood on the Employment and Earnings of British Women: A Lifecycle Approach</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>European Sociological Review</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/96835d7154e62be0dc3e7d94e3f7703e"><gtr:id>96835d7154e62be0dc3e7d94e3f7703e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Harkness S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c014fd785340.33154978</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4C2842D7-A37C-4B91-88B9-A2FB5608D52D</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Changing Nature and Consequences for Children of Growing Up in a Lone Parent Family</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b8a9ef66f8c40a0eabe818376afa3db3"><gtr:id>b8a9ef66f8c40a0eabe818376afa3db3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Harkness, Susan</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>56e026b0295379.12478140</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/K003984/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>B57EEFB7-602E-4F5D-92E4-A0C265266249</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Demography &amp; human geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>808111E3-5E04-4CEF-B080-565A81EFD6D0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Demography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
