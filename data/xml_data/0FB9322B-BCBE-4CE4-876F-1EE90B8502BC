Similarly, changes in local governance have occurred in response to these changes.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The ?Scottish Question? has been a shifting mix of questions and issues: national identity, party politics, institutional and constitutional preferences and everyday policy concerns. Similar issues underpin debates on the nature of the UK and Scotland's internal constitution: asymmetry, identity, equity, accountability and efficacy.&amp;nbsp;There have been no static ?answers?, only responses to prevailing contexts.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project explores these matters building on previous work on the UK as a 'state of unions' and debates on local governance. New archival research and elite interviews will contribute to our understanding of the issues. The focus will be on these two key&amp;nbsp;sets of related issues: the implications of the Scottish Question for the rest of the UK and implications for Scottish local governance.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>WHO WILL BENEFIT?
It is envisaged that research findings, knowledge exchange activities and outputs will be of interest to a wide audience including:
i. Scottish electorate;
ii. Wider public in rUK.
iii. Media in Scotland and rUK
iv. Younger voters
v. School teachers and those engaged with 16/17 year olds.
vi. Policy-makers in Scotland
vii. Policy-makers in rUK

HOW THEY WILL BENEFIT
i. Voting public in Scotland: the fellowship will provide information to help inform understandings of the UK-wide implications of constitutional change and the background to this debate. This debate is highly adversarial and the aim is to provide information that is balanced, nuanced and accessible.
ii. Public in rUK: there is as yet little appreciation of debates amongst the public in rUK on the SQ and this fellowship will aim to help inform the wider public in these parts of the UK of the issues as they might affect these areas. This will be done by setting the question into a broader historical context and setting out issues and options. Again it is intended to contribute to public debate with balanced, nuanced and accessible information.
iii. 16-17 year olds voting in the referendum: the fellowship will give the applicant an opportunity to engage to a greater extent than would otherwise be possible with a BBC project - 'Generation 2014' - to engage with this new electoral cohort through a series of related media events focused on a group of 16/17 year olds. It will allow the applicant to explore issues of concern and interest, identified through engagement with Generation 2014, around the SQ and to help to develop interest in and knowledge of broader UK-wide issues.
iv. Accessible information on the subject of fellowship will be offered to the Modern Studies Association webpage and newsletters.
v. Media: the applicant will offer to write articles for the print media on the themes of the fellowship including rUk and local governance implications of the debate.
vi. The applicant will write a series of paper, 'The Scottish Question and ...'. The series will be designed to provoke interest in and contribute to relevant debates. Papers will be sent to or brought to the attention of relevant policy-makers in different parts of the UK. They will be available in different formats including blogs and papers available on the web, advertised via twitter.
vii. The applicant will develop work completed for SOLACE and engage with local authorities senior officials and local politicians across Scotland throughout the duration of the project offering information and stimulating debate through various fora on issues of localism and governance in post-referendum Scotland.
viii. Scottish Leaders Forum network, a consensual body/network: the applicant will use his contacts through this consensual network to inform and stimulate debate.
ix. Information will be provided for Parliamentarians, Assembly Members and officials in other parts of UK on the implications of the debate for rUK targeted at specific groups through web, media and direct mailings.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>69166</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Speaking at ESRC conference on White Paper, 30 November 2013</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>14856BAD-1CA5-4823-A48E-1F60B143FE2A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Discussion of an aspect of Scottish Government White paper.

Much of the work involved contributing to public debates through addressing meetings, broadcasting and other media work. Over the course of the referendum (and since), my work on the Scottish Question has been used by media in various form. 
I was interviewed by BBC STV and Al-Jazeera regularly throughout the period of the referendum including references in online work. I advised BBC on an initiative on 16/17 year olds that ran throughout the referendum. This involved a group of 16/17 year olds - referred to as generation 2014 (http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01gf7rb) who were invited to participate in many BBC programmes (in many different forms). I met with the group and advised the senior producer on issues. I also involved Dr Jan Eichhorn, a colleagues at Edinburgh University, in this endeavour.

The following are amongst the key media contributions over the period of the fellowship:
25 November 2013: Provided commentary for BBC's Our Friends in the North, on the referendum debate and how this relates to debates on public service provision in Scandinavian countries.
30 November 2013: Provided live commentary on the publication of Scottish Government's Independence White Paper.
24 March 2014: Contributed to a documentary on the life of Margo MacDonald.
12 April 2014: Judge in finals of schools debate broadcast on Scottish Television.
In addition, I was the lead academic commentator on Scottish Television's overnight coverage of the referendum results.

The two books produced during the fellowship (one co-edited and other a single authored monograph - the latter included by Andy McSmith of the 'Independent' as one of his 'books of the year') provided the basis of much public engagement work.

In addition, I contributed a number of blogs over the course of the referendum:

INFORMING PUBLIC POLICY DEBATES

Much of the fellowship involved engagement with Scottish Government officials, local authority officials and others on the implications of the debates taking place. This included invited to private meetings with senior figures including the Permanent Secretary in the Scottish Government and a number of local authority chief executives. Presentations were given on the future of local governance and public services in the context of these debates. These presentations were mainly made at public events but mostly involved key decision-makers in different parts of Scotland ranging from the Shetland, Orkney, Borders and different parts of the Scottish central belt. Subsequently I have been involved in helping shape policy developments in discussions with SOLACE.

A report written during this period on the Future of Local Governance was submitted by the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives (SOLACE) to both the Commission on Local Democracy (the report of the Commission suggests heavy use was made of the information contained in the submission) and the Smith Commission. That report and subsequent work with SOLACE is informing public policy debates.

Since the end of the fellowship and consequent on the fellowship, SOLACE asked me to write related report on 'Educational Governance' post Smith. This has recently been submitted and I addressed SOLACE (Scotland) Development away day 2015 in Kirkwall, Orkney on Friday 20th August 2015 on this subject. This report is to be the basis of SOLACE Scotland's work on educational governance over the next year.

This report was also referred to in evidence to the Scottish parliament Local Govt and Regeneration Committee submitted by the Society of Local Authority Lawyers and Administrators:

and I was quoted by the Local Government and Regeneration Committee in its 8th report (session 2014) on Flexibility and Autonomy in Local Government):

The central contention of the outputs is that the referendum was about far more than identity or Scotland's constitutional status and that each of these four elements outlined above were inter-related and contributed to what we refer to as 'The Scottish Question'. This became evident in the expansive debates across Scotland during the referendum, though less evident in media presentations of the referendum. According to a range of commentators, these expansive debates engaged the public in an unprecedented manner. In essence, the sharp distinction between constitutional politics and normal politics, outlined by Bruce Ackerman in various works discussing 'constitutional moments', broke down in the context of the Scottish referendum. While it might be contended that the referendum was evidence of 'constitutional politics' as the 'highest form of politics' (Ackerman 1984:1022), this occurred because 'normal' (i.e. non-constitutional politics) were integral to the referendum debates.
Another feature of the work focused on the manner of engagement of different interests in these debates. It was suggested that the sharp distinction between governing and campaigning mindsets (as outlined in Gutmann and Thompson's 'The Spirit of Compromise') has some value in understanding the politics of the referendum but breaks down in some instances evident in the manner in which the referendum created space in which many matters, including public service reform, and the future of local democracy occurred. In essence, the referendum allowed from more debate rather than inhibited or limited it. however, there were issues at the core of the debate - including EU membership and the currency - that were matters of high contention and in which debate followed the campaign - uncompromising, little respect for opponents - hallmarks of this style of politics.
A crucial aspect of the manner in which everyday governing concerns insinuated themselves into the referendum debates (especially amongst elites) was evident in debates on local governance. The referendum witnessed considerable debate, especially in Scotland's northern and western islands, on the future of local governance.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings might be further tested in any future referendum e.g. on EU membership. To what extent will actors use the EU referendum as a platform for raising other matters, forcing each side to engage on matters not necessarily or obviously directly related to EU membership.
