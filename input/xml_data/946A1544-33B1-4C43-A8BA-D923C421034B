This contrasts with the traditional catalytic process for industrial NH3 production
where non-renewable natural gas is used as the energy and H2 source with a concomitant release of large CO2 emission. Thus, the development of new renewable electrocatalytic technologies can substantially reduce carbon emission by
utilizing wind energy to produce carbon free NH3. This electrification of the chemical industry will improve energy security by reducing the dependency on dwindling supply of natural gas. Further applications of eNH3 for energy storage and transportation will reduce the cost of integrating renewable into the energy mix. Oxford University and STFC will collaborate with Siemens, UK to explore various new catalytic surfaces to produce ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen (or water) by electrochemical means. This program is part of a wider consortium which is making the UK a central research hub for Green Ammonia. Three different workstreams will be carried out as follows:
Workstream 1. Management and Commercial Analysis (Lead partner Siemens). This portion of the project is focused on the management of the project and assessment of the commercial feasibility of the technology. Results from the 2 technical workstreams will be used to develop commercial models of the potential end systems.

Workstream 2. Experimental analysis (Lead Partner Oxford University). This work is divided into 3 work packages each focusing on a different Nafion based system. Key figures of merit will be established i.e. NH3 reaction rate, faradaic efficiency, time stability, voltage characteristics.

Workstream 3. Theoretical Analysis (Lead Partner Siemens). In conjunction with sub-contractors (OCF plc) and academic partner at STFC. This work stream is divided into 4 work packages. All results will be regularly exchanged with the other workstreams and will share 3 top level milestones. The work stream will be divided into 2 phases aligned with the work being undertaken in workstreams 1 and 2.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Ammonia is a commodity and the sole differentiators from the customers/market perspective are price and environmental impact. The business opportunity is to deliver a carbon-free production process for ammonia which can then be utilized as
a flexible asset for 4 sub-areas:
(i) Currently ammonia is used as a feedstock for the chemical industry. About 80% is used in the fertilizer industry with the
remaining 20% being used in varied range o chemical pro-cesses and the plastics industry.
(ii) As an energy storage medium for heat and electricity, which can be turned into heat/electricity (via gas turbines or fuel cells) on demand. (short-medium opportunity)
(iii) A fuel for the transportation sector.
(iv) As a highly efficient hydrogen carrier, thereby supporting the implementation of the Hydrogen Economy. There is currently no cost-competitive renewable based carbon-free synthetic route in the marketplace. If this technical feasibility study is successful, the impact for this new electrochemical synthesis method is (a) Carbon-free, (b) capable of integration with an intermittent energy source and (c) achieves high efficiencies. Thus, the key technology in such a synthesis and output from this work, will be the Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA), which could be integrated with a source of intermittent electricity generation.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-04-16</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-04-17</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>94965</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The work of this award is still in progress, a patent is at present being filed on behalf of Siemens.
