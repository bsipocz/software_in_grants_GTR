It develops from his recent publications and aims to provide an in-depth analysis of debates surrounding the justification of, engagement in, and effective management of war in order to protect or further perceived English religious, political or imperial interests. This project concentrates upon a key formative moment for the nation with vigorous debate at court, in Parliament, in the theatres, in publications and in private correspondence concerning the merits or otherwise of military engagement, and will be governed by three axes: chronological (representations of warfare over time); geographical (representations of warfare across three European cultures - England, France and Spain); and cultural (close comparative readings of the textual genres adopted by Shakespeare, Ralegh, Essex and Middleton). It extends chronologically from the Spanish Armada (1588) to Ralegh's execution and the outbreak of the Thirty Years' War (1618) - a watershed moment in James VI/I's weakening hold on the belligerence of many of his subjects, and on the title of 'rex pacificus' in Europe. This declaration of hostilities forms a natural terminus for the consideration of the previous three decades in English cultural debates on religious, political, and/or colonial militarism. These debates acknowledged the influences of earlier humanist writings, were enriched during the period by meditations such as Gentili's treatises, and were summarised and refined at the close of the proposed timespan of this project by Grotius. \n\nDue attention is paid to key classical/medieval legacies (e.g. Vegetius, Frontinus, Augustine, Aquinas, chronicles) and humanist writings (e.g. Erasmus, More, Machiavelli) which often shaped later debate concerning: the just war; the war commander; effective policy-making; and the protection of collective interests. Existing scholarship, though often extremely influential, has not studied the four chosen figures on an equal footing and has often neglected the diversity of genres which they exploited - history play, history, erotic poetry, prefaces, colonial pamphlets, letters of advice, strategy papers, speeches, religious polemic, translation, pageants. This enquiry considers Essex's diplomatic correspondence in French with Henri IV and de Mornay, and James I's correspondence with the Spanish Court (notably through Count Gondomar). Rather than limiting Ralegh's appreciations of warfare to his colonial pamphlets and chronicle (as is so often the case), this project links his essays on questions of foreign policy, military logistics and imperial ambition directly to his meditations on 'the just war'. Due attention is also devoted to correspondence to and from Essex and his political intimates, and to Middleton's ongoing concern with the role of the military in civilian society as represented in his pageantry, city comedies and tragedies (supported by the enormous resources now made available by the Oxford Middleton). These three substantial areas of research will inevitably offer fresh occasions to reflect upon the ways in which Shakespeare's second tetralogy explores issues of: usurpation; the obligations of sovereignty; the just war; and the introduction of military hostilities into civilian society. The twentieth and twenty-first centuries have not remained foreign to the meditation of and engagement in large-scale military campaigns, and thus it remains unsurprising that early modern literary and historical scholarship has gravitated repeatedly to these concerns. This debate remains as lively in our own times as it was 400 years ago and the documents of the late sixteenth and early seventeenth century offer valuable opportunities to interrogate our own continuing cultural investment in, management of and promotion of war as a primary mode of political intervention.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Impact Summary\n\nIn addition to the constituencies of academic beneficiaries acknowledged above:\n\nA : Information concerning forthcoming events, bibliographical details and archive resources and useful e-links generated by this research will be communicated to interested readers and researchers via webpages prepared at Bangor University and linked to the sites of IMEMS, and via the academic research network which Hiscock co-ordinates: Cultures of War and Conflict Resolution (www.culturesofwar.bangor.ac.uk - for further details, see 'Objectives' and 'Academic Beneficiaries'). The provision of bibliographic details will add to network's existing activities, and respond to the expressed desire of the extensive network membership around the globe, offering yet another significant service facilitating intellectual exchange to a diverse number of constituencies, academic, scholastic and independent.\n\nB : This research project will also be communicated to the general public via speaker presentations by Hiscock as part of: annual IMEMS series (video-conferenced to Welsh university sites and open to the general public); Hiscock's attendance at (at least) 3 major conferences during award period (for further details, see 'Objectives' and 'Academic Beneficiaries'); Bangor University's activities for sixth formers and FE colleges; Bangor University's annual 'Reaching Higher, Reaching Wider' series of outreach initiatives to non-academic communities in the region. Hiscock has participated in these activities already throughout his period of employment at Bangor University. \n\nC : In 2012 a 'Cultures of War' conference ('War and Civil Society in the Early Modern Period') will be accompanied by a Bangor University Library exhibition (advertised in regional press and University webpages) of early modern publications linked to the debate of warfare in Europe with specific reference to the early modern print culture and the experience of war (e.g. recruitment, textual/dramatic representation, legal debate, defense preparations, returning troops) in early modern civilian society. This exhibition will offer an explanatory guide and opened with an introductory talk by Hiscock. Images of some of the exhibited items will also appear on relevant University webpages. Where appropriate, items and publications from the important Mostyn and Bangor Cathedral Library collections will be exhibited - thus, enabling many different constituencies (esp. schools and colleges as well as general public) throughout the region to engage with this lively debate of warfare in the early modern, and indeed modern, periods.\n\nD : The general public will be able to access information about this important period of early modern culture through Hiscock's monograph (80k) and related publications (e.g. peer-reviewed journal article 8k, publication in collection or journal format of conference papers, for further details see 'Objectives' and 'Academic Beneficiaries') to be available through the open-access Bangor University e-repository (see http://dspace.bangor.ac.uk/dspace/) \n\nThus, this research enquiry will not only address numerous constituencies regionally, nationally and internationally through a variety of different media, it will engage directly with an urgent and ongoing cultural debate more generally concerning the recourse to war which is being pursued at all levels of British society and beyond on an almost daily basis. This project would certainly offer the opportunity for Bangor university collections to showcase many of their resources which are not currently on display. Moreover, this comparative study could serve as a model for exploring closer links between university research interests and those of the general public by investigating common areas of debate.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-07-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>71071</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This exhibition drew upon materials and archives from the Bangor University Manuscripts and Archives Collection and the Bangor Cathedral Manuscripts Collection and offered visitors a range of perspectives of the ways in which Shakespearean texts have been published, read and performed from the 17th to the early 19th centuries.</gtr:description><gtr:id>40AB6376-9686-46AF-86F8-4FA289BFAC01</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This exhibition was open to delegates of the 'Early Shakespeare: on Stage and Page1590-1790' conference which I co-organised with Dr. Stephen Colclough in December 2012.
