TB infects one-third of the world's population and causes the highest mortality of any bacterial infection. There are high levels of TB in the UK, with almost 10,000 new cases each year. Treatment is prolonged and lasts a minimum of 6 months; hence, many people fail to complete therapy which ideally would be a lot shorter. This is one of the factors leading to a rise in TB resistant to many of the essential drugs. In addition, there are currently very few potential new antibiotics in the pipeline for this disease. Consequently, new approaches to tackling infection are required. 

Much of the damage caused by TB is a result of massive activation of the patient's own immune system. This causes inflammation that leads first to tissue damage, then ultimately results in symptoms and even death. There are only a limited number of compounds which can break down tissues in disease. Previous data show that the enzymes called matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are central to this process. In addition, TB causes generalised weight loss and debilitation, leading to the common name of 'consumption'. It is now being realised that there is an interaction between the body's metabolism and the development of inflammation. The proposed research explores this interaction between metabolism and MMP secretion in TB. The studies will take place both in an established human cellular model and in patients. Once this driver of inflammation is understood and key points that regulate the process defined, there will be the potential to develop new approaches to the treatment of TB. 

The research will be conducted under the supervision of Professor Jon Friedland in the Department of Infectious Diseases and Immunity at Imperial College London.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>This project will investigate the hypothesis that metabolic pathways regulate gene expression and secretion of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in tuberculosis (TB) by a HIF-dependent mechanism. Specific aims are, first, to investigate the interaction between metabolic pathways and proinflammatory cytokine/MMP gene expression and secretion in TB-infected human macrophages and in a multicellular model of infection. Second, involvement of HIF-1a and AMPK in metabolic control of key MMPs in TB will be examined. Finally, indicators of glycolysis and upregulation of key signalling pathways will be investigated in TB patients. In a cellular model of TB, the effect of glucose, glucose restriction, 2-deoxyglucose and galactose on TNF, IL-1 and MMP gene expression (qPCR) and secretion (ELISA, luminex &amp;amp; zymography) by human monocyte-derived macrophages and primary respiratory epithelial cells will be examined. The effect of succinate will be assessed in dose-response and kinetic experiments and the effect of 2-DG on succinate dehydrogenase activity will be measured using a colorimetric assay based on formation of nitroblue diformazan. Using specific chemical inhibitors, siRNA technology and a dual-luciferase gene reporter system, the potentially key role of the transcription factor NF-kB will be investigated. Next, in the purpose-built hypoxia chamber in our Category 3 TB laboratory, the role of HIF-1 in this process will be determined.The expression of pyruvate kinase M2 (which interacts with HIF-1) and the upstream proline hydroxylases 2/3 will be analysed. On the basis of preliminary data, the linking regulatory role of a peak AMPK will be investigated. In TB patients, lactate concentrations in lymph nodes will be measured as a marker of glycolysis. Lung biopsies will be stained for the active form of AMPK with dual staining for pyruvate kinase M2 and HIF-1 as appropriate. These studies will be the first to define the interaction between metabolism and tissue damage in TB.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Academic impacts:
Increased understanding of tuberculosis (TB) immunopathogenesis and, in particular, the mechanisms driving tissue destruction in TB, should identify potential novel therapeutic targets in this infection. These would aim to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients by limiting tissue inflammation and damage. The role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is not restricted to just this infectious disease or to this area. Increased understanding of MMP biology may impact on both other infection research and on areas as diverse as oncology, cardiovascular science and renal medicine. In particular, the understanding of the interaction between metabolic pathways and innate immunity is at the earliest stages and the potential for unexpected developments is high. The academic benefits will be felt towards the end of the project as findings are disseminated.

Economic and social impacts:
The possibility of new treatments for TB will attract pharmaceutical research and, if successful, drug development; TB drugs are aimed mainly at the poor. New therapeutic approaches will potentially allow improved management of drug-resistant infection, hence saving lives. They might also reduce treatment duration, which will potentially enhance quality of life and, in those of employable age, economic productivity. In addition to enhancing the pharmacopoeia for TB, it is possible that the duration of treatment might also be reduced from the current minimum of 6 months. This will increase compliance and decrease patient follow-up time, with consequential personal, community and economic benefit. Identification of novel therapeutic targets for TB will potentially benefit TB patients both in the UK and worldwide, where deaths approach 2 million each year. The timescale from commencement of the research to realisation of these more general benefits will be at least 10 years. 

Training Benefits:
I shall develop analytical, laboratory and information technology skills, which will enhance my future education and training. These benefits will ultimately be returned with interest, as I will train students, clinical fellows and postdoctoral scientists when I am running an independent research laboratory in 8-10 years' time.

Public Engagement with Science benefits:
Dissemination of my research findings will be one cog in the increased information available to the public and heighten the lay understanding of science. TB is already of some interest to the public, as witnessed by its frequent appearance in the press, hence is a promising hook for such activities.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-16</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>211412</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/K000950/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>03BA7BC9-C251-48FC-8EA9-5F7414A63FEE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Infection</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
