Quantum-photonic devices may find use in various fields of science and technology, such as computing, information communications, biomedical imaging, and medicine. In terms of quantum communication applications, single photons and photonic entanglement are the most reliable approaches. While classical security keys are based on exponential complexity in their decoding (using classical computers which are available today), quantum keys are ideally 100% secure, relying on fundamental concepts of nature. The best-known quantum key distribution protocols are based on communication with single photons. The fundamental approach to security here relies on impossibility to copy the information without changing it (so-called 'no cloning' theorem). Protocols, based on entangled states, generate a secret key only after it has been delivered to an approved recipient. Moreover, computations based on quantum phenomena - i.e. replacing classical bits by q-bits - promise much faster and efficient realisations of different algorithms, such as the integer factorisation problem.

There is no doubt that nanotechnology has revolutionised science in the 21st century, not only because of the possibilities to manufacture devices of tiny dimensions, but also because it motivated a conceptual reconsideration of basic 'classical' concepts in fundamental and applied science. The interplay between classical and quantum effects lead to numerous opportunities to address old challenges and bring in new solutions for a large number of conventional problems. For example, in order to cause an efficient interaction with light on the nano-scale, one has to confine the electromagnetic field much beyond its free-space wavelength. While conventional dielectric structures are incapable of supporting optical fields much below a half-wavelength cube volume, metallic (plasmonic) structures at visible and near infrared (NIR) regimes - having negative electrical-permittivity - do not have such a limitation.

The overall aim of the project is to create a multi-disciplinary interface between two areas of science - 'quantum optics' and 'nano-plasmonics', and to reach a state-of-the-art understanding of nano-scale interactions in applications to quantum information and imaging. From a fundamental point-of-view, the proposed research will lead to an understanding of the potential underlying limitations of a plasmonic platform for quantum optical technologies. In terms of applications, the research will concentrate on communication and computations with the proposed sources in the sub-wavelength scales and on imaging with quantum state illumination.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project addresses fundamental societal needs by providing novel communication and computation technologies which lay the foundation for advances in development of consumer and military applications. For example, Switzerland already uses quantum communication channels for encrypted interconnections between banks, and even for voice counting at elections. There is a clear need for the UK to close the gap and to establish competitive and highly technological solutions in this niche area of research.

The 21st century concepts of quantum phenomena present an enormous potential for ultra fast computation, secure communications, improved imaging and sensing for biomedical applications, and environmental monitoring. The use of Quantum Coherence Tomography in medical instrumentation will enhance functionality of existing equipment, which in turn will have a positive impact on the quality of health services. This, like other major technological advances, will be an enabling mechanism for improving quality of life and prosperity in the UK. In the medical, dermatology and cosmetic sectors, quantum imaging may become a new diagnostic technique. As mid-infra red light can penetrate the uppermost layers of skin, it may provide the missing quick diagnostic tool for skin cancer. An application of a different nature could lie in the detection of chemical and biological agents. 'Investigation of Quantum Coherence Tomography enhanced by plasmonic labelling' is one of the project's work packages, marked to have the primary importance in the proposal.

The impact of quantum computing will influence daily tasks that rely on data processing and therefore permeate many aspects of modern life. Nowadays, it is impossible to imagine a successful high-tech industry without strong computational abilities. The ability to model whole systems and to estimate their performance before they are actually built has meant huge savings, both financial and temporal. However, the increasing challenges of modern engineering always require more and more computational effort.

Quantum computing, which is expected to benefit from this project, is a conceptually new approach to computation technology and promises novel ultrafast solutions for problems which are unsolvable for classical machines. Equally, the enhanced possibilities to model and predict outcomes of different events, such as emergency situations in the transport network or natural disasters, will significantly improve safety and provide reassurance to the public. Similarly, modelling and prediction of industrial processes in the chemical and heavy industries may significantly decrease air pollution, thus positively influencing the environment. Another obvious example is weather forecasting. Modelling such events is still of infinite complexity, and classical computational tools are not capable of dealing with this adequately and providing trustworthy predictions. 

Communications and computations industries represent a huge market and are very flexible in providing funding for new, promising technologies. High risk projects are of potential interest for investment, and the establishment of new R&amp;amp;D divisions will attract a talented work force and create new jobs. Commercialization of the end product will enhance this trend even more, and the realization of the project objectives promises to result in several patents which have potential industrial interest. I was the co-author of a patent which lead to the establishment of a start-up company for the development of devices for bio-imaging.

Quantum cryptography offers an absolute secure communication channel which, even theoretically, cannot be eavesdropped on. Widespread usage of such a safe data exchange protocol will most certainly improve national security and may help reduce cyber crime. One of the main objectives of the project is the investigation of reliable, efficient, compact, and integrable devices required for quantum cryptography.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-03-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>264086</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Frontier quantum technology aims to change, and in fact already affecting, the daily life.

Few significant steps towards achieving major far going goals were already done, delivering quite a few important results. For example, the novel effect of the near field interference were proposed and experimentally demonstrated. This novel phenomenon enables circulation of quantum signals on nano-scale and paves the way for novel compact and efficient platform for quantum networks. Several theoretical models were developed in order to address the influence of quantum nose on performance of various quantum devices, including compact lasers, resonators, and directional nano-antennae.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Frontier quantum technology aims to change, and in fact already affecting, the daily life.
