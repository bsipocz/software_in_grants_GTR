They usually affect young people and are chronic, leading to significant disability and death in severe cases if left untreated. The reasons for this are not fully understood but a suspected combination of genetic factors and environmental triggers is likely. One way of studying the cause of diseases is to compare the genes of people who have the disease with those that do not and to identify differences between the two. Studies of genetic variation in autoimmune conditions have identified many genes which are linked. One such gene is called IKZF3 which regulates how a key cell in the immune system develops- the B-cell. This type of cell is responsible for making antibodies to fight infections but is also significant in many autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. 
 
This particular gene would also be an important one to study as there already exists a mouse model with a dysfunctional IKZF3 gene. These mice develop autoimmune conditions similar to human disease as well as lymphoma, a type of blood cancer. In addition, they do not develop fully functioning immune system, being more susceptible to infections. The vast majority of genes identified previously by these studies have not been shown to cause disease on their own in mice like IKZF3. I suspect, therefore, that this gene has a prominent role to play in the development of autoimmune conditions making this an exciting and novel target for further research.

I propose to study the effect of this particular gene at each stage of B-cell development. I will study how the amount of IKZF3 changes at each stage and which other genes it is interacting with and regulating. By doing this, I hope to develop a deep understanding of its function and elucidate some of the pathways that maybe involved in the development of autoimmune conditions. Ultimately, i hope to identify key targets for further study but also new drug treatments for these conditions.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>1&amp;amp;2) Identify a panel of differentially expressed targets for Aiolos binding in B-cells during plasma-cell differentiation
Chromatin immunoprecipitation, using an antibody currently being used for ChIP-Seq in a number of different cell types within the host laboratory, will be performed to identify target genes regulated by IKZF3 at Day 0, Day 3, Day 6, Day 13 and Day 20 of the plasma cell differentiation protocol. Differential expression of IKZF3 targets from RNA-Seq data will be assessed using an analysis pipeline currently in use within the host laboratory. Western blotting of the proteins coded by differentially-regulated expression targets will be used to verify the corresponding changes in protein expression for the differentially regulated IKZF3 target genes
 
3) Study the effect of IKZF3 knock-down on the differentiation of B-cells and expression of target genes
IKZF3 expression in na&amp;iuml;ve B cells will also be knocked-down, using an siRNA used successfully in the host laboratory, to see how IKZF3 deficiency affects the numbers of cells, the ChIP-Seq peaks and RNA-Seq expression during the five stages of the plasma cell differentiation protocol from Aim 2.
 
4) Identify IKZF3-dependent biological pathways important in plasma cell differentiation.
Having used bioinformatics techniques to correlate the DNA-binding affinity of IKZF3 with differential expression of gene targets (Aims 2-3), I will use Ingenuity Pathway Analysis to identify cell-type specific biological pathways which maybe important at each stage of plasma cell differentiation. Manipulation of the individual proteins in each of these pathways may yield potential regulators of plasma cell differentiation and be the subjects of my future research and which may lead to therapy.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have contributed significantly to our understanding of complex autoimmune conditions. For example, GWAS in rheumatoid arthritis have previously identified the TNF receptor as a susceptibility locus, whilst we know that TNF blockade is an effective treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, further genetic studies have identified several loci which predict for non-response to treatment. From this example, it can be seen that understanding disease at the genetic and molecular level can have direct translational effect in clinical practice. 

The current research group has recently published the results of a large European SLE GWAS (led by Professor Vyse) which has implicated three members of the Ikaros transcription factor family - IKZF1 (Ikaros), IKZF2 (Helios) and IKZF3 (Aiolos) - as risk factors for SLE. The overall strategy of the wider IKZF work, is to discover the tissue specific differences in DNA binding sites for these three Ikaros transcription factors (using ChIP-Seq) and then to unmask the consequential changes in gene expression (using RNA-Seq) arising from transcription factor binding. Being aware of tissue specific differences in DNA binding for each Ikaros transcription factor, members of the group are currently characterising the differences in DNA binding sites of IKZF3 (Aiolos) in EBV-LCLs/ex vivo B cells and of IKZF2 (Helios) in regulatory T cells.

The research group has embarked on a programme of work to investigate the role of the Ikaros family of transcript factors in autoimmunity. The IKZF transcription factors have also been implicated in other autoimmune diseases. IKZF3 (Aiolos) is of particular interest as there already exists a knock out mouse model which we know develops autoimmunity as well as haematological malignancies. Moreover, recent studies indicate an improtant role for this transcription factor in myeloma (a recent study has demonstrated that degradation of Aiolos is an important therapeutic effect of treatment with lenalidomide). The work described in this fellowship would complement the ongoing work in the group and take advantage of a collaboration initiated with Dr Reuben Tooze at Leeds University, to investigate the biology of plasma cells. It complements and expands on ongoing efforts within the group and will allow me to develop an individual line of research, whilst operating in an environment in which closely related activities are being pursued. 

On a personal level, this research project will equip me with the necessary skills to become an academic clinician. I would develop both practical laboratory skills as well critical thinking and problem solving abilities. This PhD programme will enable me to progress and help achieve my aim of becoming a leader in basic scientific and clinical research. 

Globally, identifying targets for this transcription factor is, therefore, likely to lead to identification of novel therapeutic targets that will benefit patients with autoimmune disease and haematological malignancies such as myeloma. Development of these treatments will benefit not only patients but also commercial companies who will produce the drugs developed as a result of this research.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>238265</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1B197091-B890-4412-844E-DB4F8B710053</gtr:id><gtr:title>Abnormal B Cell Development in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus: What the Genetics Tell Us.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Arthritis &amp; rheumatology (Hoboken, N.J.)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/316eceeb9f24530ff3bfab2d1d264442"><gtr:id>316eceeb9f24530ff3bfab2d1d264442</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Karrar S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2326-5191</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a856b0c3cfd99.27946855</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/N021118/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>C6D70A71-8796-47BC-AFE0-CC2286E66A06</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Inflammatory and Immune System</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
