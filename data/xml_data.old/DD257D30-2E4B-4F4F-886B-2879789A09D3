In addition, the visual artist working with Rotherham museums will create a work of art as part of the work for Creative Partnerships that reflects on the images and narratives of the research participants. One refereed article drawing on words and images from the dataset will also be written on the project, for an international audience.

The audience for the exhibition of the family narratives will be the families and the school communities, and the museums service and community groups in Rotherham. The audience for the visual artist's display or work or art will also be the communities of Rotherham and a wider community which would include creative artists and those involved in Creative Partnerships dissemination. It is hoped that the work of art will be also put on a web page.

An international academic audience will read the peer-reviewed article, which will go into a journal that takes image as well as text as its focus.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-03-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>9692</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This was a community curated exhibition which was held in central Rotherham.
