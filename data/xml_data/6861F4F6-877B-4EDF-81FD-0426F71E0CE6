In classical information science, information is encoded digitally. For example, if a switch can be either up or down, then it can store a single classical bit of information. Any classical computer, from an abacus to a modern desktop PC, could be seen as nothing but a collection of such switches, along with the means to flip them up and down. Of course the PC is much faster! Quantum information science is different because information is encoded in a quantum system, such as a spinning charged particle in a magnetic field. Such a particle is a bit like a switch, because it can be spinning in one, or in the other direction with respect to the field. But the particle can also be in what is called a superposition of the two. This is hard to visualize and in terms of the classical switch there is no analogue. Further, the quantum particle can be entangled with other particles, exhibiting an apparently instantaneous connection even though they are widely separated in space.These strange features make a big difference. By manipulating quantum systems, we can do things that are impossible using classical, digital devices. A quantum computer, for example, can factorize a large number extremely rapidly, whereas this is strongly believed to be a difficult problem for classical computers. Present day encryption is often based on the difficulty of factorizing numbers, thus a quantum computer could easily crack the codes that are used to protect credit card details. But quantum information science also provides the solution: using a technique called quantum key distribution, we can send secret messages in such a way that security is guaranteed by the laws of quantum theory.The first part of the project involves the theoretical development of a new idea for quantum key distribution. The novel feature is that the proof of security does not need to assume anything about the operation of the quantum devices employed. So if a device is supposed to measure the horizontal polarization of a photon, say, a user does not need to trust that it really is doing that. Unlike all existing approaches, the new idea does not even need to assume the correctness of quantum theory. The crucial assumption is something different, which is the physical impossibility of sending transmissions faster than light. The advantage of this is that secret messages can be secure even when the users are not physicists but commercial users who have obtained their equipment from a potentially untrustworthy source. But at present there is only a proof of principle that the idea will work: perfect noise-free conditions are assumed and the rate at which messages can be sent is too slow to be useful in practice. A main goal of the project is to develop the theory to the point where the idea is a viable real-world possibility.The second part of the project is less about practical application but aims to improve our understanding of quantum theory. Given any well developed physical model, one can ask, what would information processing be like if the universe were described by that model? Could we build computers even better than quantum computers? This is a good way of learning about the limitations of quantum information processing, as well as the successes. How special is quantum theory, and why did Nature choose this theory and not another? I have already developed a mathematical framework that enables us to write down a wide range of different physical models and then to explore these questions. The goal is to determine which features of quantum theory are generic, in the sense that they would be present in almost any possible theory, and which are unique. In particular, I have suggested that quantum theory is the best theory for computation out of all possible theories. If true, this would be a very deep fact about Nature.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>101646</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Economist article</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>239C9342-D519-4A0A-99FB-69354B3A82EB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Interviewed by a journalist for an article on quantum cryptography that appeared in The Economist.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e06d492fc432.76365547</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Media (as a channel to the public)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21586529-quantum-cryptography-has-yet-deliver-truly-unbreakable-way-sending</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>FQXi article</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A4245952-32A1-4F05-B271-F07C74F88863</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I was interviewed by a journalist for an article, commissioned by the Foundational Questions Institute, about my research.

One of the PhD students is now a rising star in academia, with a 5-year fellowship at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics. The other has obtained a position as Project Manager with Google, and is now using the skills obtained during his PhD studies to oversee the development of commercial projects. I am currently training 3 PhD students, who started after the end of my CAF, but are working on projects for which the initial development was part of the funded research.

The research findings themselves laid the foundations for device-independent quantum cryptography. Device-independent means that honest users can be sure that a protocol is secure, even when they do not have a precise characterisation, or perhaps simply do not trust, the quantum devices that they are using. I am not aware of any commercial application already in place that is specifically an application of the theory of device-independence. But the EPSRC-funded UK Quantum Hubs are playing a large role in developing quantum technologies to the point of industrial exploitation. A component of the Oxford-based NQIT Hub, for which I am the workpackage leader, is dedicated to the further development of device-independent quantum protocols, for implementation using the Hub's flagship technology of trapped ions. Since my research, the theory of device-independence has been broadened, to include many other protocols, such as the secure verification of uncharacterised quantum devices. Protocols like this will play a crucial role as quantum information processing devices get more widely used in society, and are also being developed by the NQIT Hub, with leadership provided by Elham Kashefi, of the University of Edinburgh. This is being done in collaboration with many non-academic partners including, for example, Toshiba, Google, and GCHQ. Meanwhile, the York-based Quantum Communications Hub is developing photonic quantum cryptographic systems, with partners including BT, Toshiba, and Airbus. The Quantum Communications Hub also has a component dedicated to the exploration of new theoretical approaches, such as device-independence.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>DA6065B7-12C3-46FE-9A7E-444EB86BDDCA</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56e097e774b055.82658741</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software)</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Quantum key distribution provides a means for separated parties to share a secret key, which can then be used for cryptographic purposes, such as sending secret messages. Most quantum protocols suffer a certain drawback, which is that the honest users need to trust that their quantum devices are operating as expected. Device-independent quantum key distribution removes this requirement. By measuring entangled quantum systems, separated users can generate a secret key that is secure regardless of the internal operation of their devices. The aim of the first part of the project was to develop the idea of device-independent quantum key distribution beyond a proof of principle. The main findings are as follows:



-- We designed a quantum protocol, with two advantages over prior work. One is that it enables generation of secret key in the presence of realistic experimental noise, i.e., does not assume an error-free quantum channel. The other is that the protocol attains a positive rate of key generation per channel use. 



-- We designed a protocol that removes a different disadvantage of prior work. Existing protocols needed to assume that a separate pair of laboratory devices is used for each pair of quantum particles, something that would be completely unfeasible in practice. The novel scheme requires only two quantum devices for its operation, one for each user. 



-- We described a new class of attacks on device-independent key distribution, which can be applied when devices are reused in subsequent iterations of the protocol. Modifications of the protocol design can protect against some of these attacks, but in the event that devices are completely untrusted, for example if completely uncharacterized devices are supplied by a potential eavesdropper, then security requires a separate set of devices for each iteration.



The second part of the project was not directly concerned with cryptography. The aim was to establish connections between the principles of information processing, and the structure of a probabilistic theory such as quantum mechanics. 



-- We described a mathematical model, which contains systems in more highly entangled states than in quantum theory. Seeing as entanglement is a resource for quantum information processing, the expectation was that this alternative model would be more powerful for some tasks. We showed, however that there is a tradeoff between the degree of entanglement a theory permits, and the possibilities for dynamics. From a mathematical point of view, quantum theory appears optimized for information processing.



-- We defined various notions of information-theoretic entropy in a model-independent way. This permits problems of the storage and transmission of information to be addressed in the context of models more general than quantum theory. 



Finally, in other work related to the second part of the project, we considered a question that originates in debates between Einstein and Bohr in the early days of quantum theory. The question concerns whether the quantum mechanical wave function is a representation of a physical entity, or rather, as many have argued, as a representation of information about a physical system. This question is of fundamental significance, but is also relevant to the question of the resources needed to simulate quantum systems by classical means.



-- We proved a no-go theorem, which states that any model in which distinct quantum states sometimes represent the same underlying physical state cannot recover the predictions of quantum theory. Given the assumptions of the theorem, the quantum state must represent reality directly.



-- We carried out the necessary theoretical work to design and perform the first experimental test of the no-go theorem. The experiment, requiring high precision preparation and measurement of trapped ions, shows, up to experimental errors, that in any classical model, distinct quantum states must correspond to distinct values of a classical variable.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>If quantum systems are used as the carriers of information, then communication, cryptographic and computational tasks can be accomplished, which would be impossible using standard digital information technologies. There is thus potential for major benefit to society if quantum technologies can be realized. The project has improved our theoretical understanding of the connections between information processing and the structure of a theory like quantum mechanics. In the longer term, this will suggest new ways in which quantum systems can be used to solve information processing problems.



Quantum cryptography presents fewer technological barriers than quantum computation, and is already commercially available, although as a nascent technology has yet to find widespread deployment. The project has developed protocols for quantum cryptography that do not assume that the quantum devices employed are well-made or trustworthy. This will enable quantum cryptography to be used in a wider range of scenarios, across government and commercial sectors. Quantum cryptography enables secure communication without relying on unproven mathematical assumptions. Device-independent quantum cryptography is useful in scenarios in which there is a need for secure communication, but where quantum devices are supplied by a third party who may have been incompetent or even malicious. In most real world applications of quantum cryptography there will be at least some risk that this is the case. The project has made a number of important steps towards a protocol for device-independent quantum key distribution that is (i) noise-tolerant, (ii) achieves a high rate of key generation, and (iii) has no unfeasible requirements, all of which are necessary for successful real world deployment of a cryptographic scheme. In the near term, the protocols we have designed will form the basis of future work towards this goal, which we expect will be carried out within industry and within academia. Additionally, the mathematical techniques we have introduced to prove security of our protocols will find application to a broader range of cryptographic problems, such as the generation of trusted randomness using untrusted devices.



In the second part of the project, we established connections between principles of information processing and the structure of the probabilistic theory that governs the systems used as information carriers. This will enable novel characterizations of quantum theory, and in the longer term, a deeper understanding of quantum theory as a theory of information processing. We found a no-go theorem that puts tight constraints on classical simulations of quantum systems. This motivates a new kind of experimental test of quantum theory, and in the short term, we expect that such tests will be carried out. This work will also be useful in suggesting new ways in which quantum systems can outperform classical systems in tasks involving information processing.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>28DF8361-C046-4351-B362-FB23464ED8CD</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545fb646085c94.39720678</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Security and Diplomacy,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F53B1BF8-F212-469B-96A7-4ED0E41A5085</gtr:id><gtr:title>Can different quantum state vectors correspond to the same physical state?
