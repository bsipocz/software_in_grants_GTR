Sciences and Antimicrobial Resistance</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/M027546/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Antimicrobial (antibiotic) resistance (AMR) is a major and growing problem in many areas of medicine. AMR has been recognised as one of the most important challenges facing the UK. The availability of effective antimicrobial compounds underpins much of modern health care, making possible invasive surgical procedures and aggressive chemotherapeutic regimes that would otherwise be compromised by unacceptable risk of bacterial infection. Within this broad area, the increasing prevalence of resistant Gram-negative bacteria as causes of healthcare associated infections, the lack of new agents effective against these organisms, and the consequent requirement to stimulate antibiotic development, are all highlighted in the recent report of the UK Chief Medical Officer. 

Physical scientists, engineers and mathematicians can make potentially transformative contributions to tackling AMR. Unleashing this potential requires new ways of interdisciplinary working, and bringing together researchers from these disciplines with counterparts from biology and human and animal medicine. We will achieve this by the following specific objectives:
(1) A wide range of networking activities to build new interdisciplinary research communities
(2) Pump-priming projects in, and across, three distinct strands we have identified, building on EPS research strengths, aligned with AMR strategy, to foster transformative research to combat AMR
(3) Training activities (training EPS researchers in biomedical methods and models and vice versa), to aid EPS researchers in understanding AMR and equip biomedical researchers to apply EPS methods, effectively training a new generation of researchers to tackle the problems of AMR 

The University of Bristol is exceptionally well placed to build and deliver new engineering and physical science research into AMR, combining as it does international excellence across all of these fields. The University of Bristol houses world-leading research in the physical sciences, mathematics, computer science and engineering, much of which is EPSRC-funded. Bristol is also a thriving centre for basic biomedical, clinical, veterinary and community health research, with studies into AMR as a key strength. AMR is a strategic priority at the University of Bristol through our Infection and Immunity research theme and with support from the Elizabeth Blackwell Institute (EBI) for Health Research, we have already begun building connections across these interdisciplinary communities. This Bridging the Gaps project will exploit the potential opportunities that exist across a wide range of outstanding EPS researchers, including those who have never previously felt their research was relevant to AMR. By ensuring that EPS researchers are core members of interdisciplinary research activity, we will identify and seed new approaches to analyse, mitigate and ultimately overcome AMR. UoB houses world-leading research in materials science, engineering, synthetic biology, physics, maths/statistics, nanoscience and chemistry, all with significant EPSRC funding. UoB currently has the 6th largest EPSRC portfolio of any UK University, with in excess of &amp;pound;200M in live grants. Bristol is also a thriving centre for biomedical, clinical and community health research (within Clinical Sciences, Veterinary Sciences, Cellular and Molecular Medicine and in our NHS Trust partners, UoB has the fifth largest active portfolio of grants classified by EPSRC as relevant to the Healthcare sector, totalling approx &amp;pound;30M), in which studies of AMR form a key part. UoB has an outstanding track record of success in developing new interdisciplinary collaborations to address major societal challenges with the EBI, which was formed in 2012 for this express purpose. The EBI is ideally placed to help building interdisciplinary capacity in AMR, and has an existing governance mechanism for open and transparent deployment of this type of funding.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Benefit of the activities on the future of collaborative research addressing AMR at the institution: UoB hosts considerable experience in the AMR field and EPS departments with huge potential for developing solutions, but the two are disconnected by structural and administrative barriers. The overriding objective of this Bridging the Gaps project is to equip engineers and physical scientists (EPS) at the University of Bristol (UoB) with the knowledge and resources necessary to make future substantive discoveries that will tackle the problem of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR). We will use specific mechanisms to break these down and forge collaborations as described in the Pathways to Impact. By its very nature, the primary impact of this project will be an increase in collaborative research between UoB EPS and biomedical sciences academics in AMR.

Potential External Beneficiaries: Whilst the primary impact of this project will be to generate collaborations within UoB, advances in AMR research may be transformative beyond the lifetime of this project. Our proposed activities encompass novel antimicrobial discovery (research theme 1) to replenish the supply of drugs; improving antimicrobial delivery (research theme 2) to minimise systemic and environmental exposure, reduce selection for resistance and revitalise existing antibiotics; and health research and surveillance interventions (research theme 3) to reduce antibiotic prescribing and slow resistance development. These may impact upon:
The UK Population: AMR is a significant detriment to UK population health, with resulting increases in morbidity and mortality affecting tens of thousands of people each year. Advances in any of the three research areas would have significant impact on the health of the nation. AMR is also a significant veterinary issue and a threat to global food security.
The UK Health and Social Care systems: AMR cost the UK economy &amp;pound;1 billion per year in 1998, (House of Lords report), and &amp;pound;10 blion per year today (Chief Medical Officer). Greater decline in patient well being prolongs recovery, increases cost, and may result in long term complications that increase cost to outpatient, GP and social care, and potentially reduce the working lifetime of the patient. Any outcome arising from this work that reduces disease severity and time to cure, has the potential to save society money.
 
Industry/UK Economic Activity: AMR is a global problem. UK research council led research such as this offers potential for direct economic benefit from the research, development and sale of novel antimicrobial drugs, diagnostic tests and drug delivery systems to overseas healthcare systems. There is also potential for job creation in the UK and economic flow from the rest of the world into the UK during the R&amp;amp;D phase.

Increasing impact by learning from Industry: Academics can misunderstand the requirements for achieving successful therapeutic/diagnostics. Accordingly, during the project lifetime, we will use specific events as described in the Pathways to Impact to improve translation of UoB EPS research in the AMR area. This will increase the likelihood of delivering impact to external beneficiaries as set out above. 

Public and Educational Engagement: AMR is primarily driven by actions of people. One way to slow the rate of AMR development is public education about the problem, its causes and potential solutions, including the value of taxpayer-funded research. Public interest in this subject, and recognition of its importance, is evidenced by the vote to set the Longitude Prize in the AMR area. Similarly, engaging with schools and young people will enhance awareness, inspire the next generation about research and possible careers in STEM, and highlight opportunities and advances in interdisciplinary research in the AMR field in particular. We see these types of engagements as important impacts and describe events and activities to deliver them.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>592169</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>BristolBridge AMR CrossFire video series

Antimicrobial (antibiotic) resistance (AMR) is a major and growing problem in many areas of medicine. AMR has been recognised as one of the most important challenges facing the UK. The availability of effective antimicrobial compounds underpins much of modern health care, making possible invasive surgical procedures and aggressive chemotherapeutic regimes that would otherwise be compromised by unacceptable risk of bacterial infection. Within this broad area, the increasing prevalence of resistant Gram-negative bacteria as causes of healthcare associated infections, the lack of new agents effective against these organisms, and the consequent requirement to stimulate antibiotic development, are all highlighted in the recent report of the UK Chief Medical Officer. 

Physical scientists, engineers and mathematicians can make potentially transformative contributions to tackling AMR. Unleashing this potential requires new ways of interdisciplinary working, and bringing together researchers from these disciplines with counterparts from biology and human and animal medicine. We will achieve this by the following specific objectives:

(1) A wide range of networking activities to build new interdisciplinary research communities

(2) Pump-priming projects in, and across, three distinct strands we have identified, building on EPS research strengths, aligned with AMR strategy, to foster transformative research to combat AMR

(3) Training activities (training EPS researchers in biomedical methods and models and vice versa), to aid EPS researchers in understanding AMR and equip biomedical researchers to apply EPS methods, effectively training a new generation of researchers to tackle the problems of AMR 

The University of Bristol is exceptionally well placed to build and deliver new engineering and physical science research into AMR, combining as it does international excellence across all of these fields. The University of Bristol houses world-leading research in the physical sciences, mathematics, computer science and engineering, much of which is EPSRC-funded. Bristol is also a thriving centre for basic biomedical, clinical, veterinary and community health research, with studies into AMR as a key strength. AMR is a strategic priority at the University of Bristol through our Infection and Immunity research theme and with support from the Elizabeth Blackwell Institute (EBI) for Health Research, we have already begun building connections across these interdisciplinary communities. This Bridging the Gaps project will exploit the potential opportunities that exist across a wide range of outstanding EPS researchers, including those who have never previously felt their research was relevant to AMR. By ensuring that EPS researchers are core members of interdisciplinary research activity, we will identify and seed new approaches to analyse, mitigate and ultimately overcome AMR. UoB houses world-leading research in materials science, engineering, synthetic biology, physics, maths/statistics, nanoscience and chemistry, all with significant EPSRC funding. UoB currently has the 6th largest EPSRC portfolio of any UK University, with in excess of &amp;pound;200M in live grants. Bristol is also a thriving centre for biomedical, clinical and community health research (within Clinical Sciences, Veterinary Sciences, Cellular and Molecular Medicine and in our NHS Trust partners, UoB has the fifth largest active portfolio of grants classified by EPSRC as relevant to the Healthcare sector, totalling approx &amp;pound;30M), in which studies of AMR form a key part. UoB has an outstanding track record of success in developing new interdisciplinary collaborations to address major societal challenges with the EBI, which was formed in 2012 for this express purpose. The EBI is ideally placed to help building interdisciplinary capacity in AMR, and has an existing governance mechanism for open and transparent deployment of this type of funding.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>8A9267B4-AAD3-413A-B2B9-AAD9FDDA68CD</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56e0bb8a657ad4.59640052</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs><gtr:productOutput><gtr:description>New collaborations that have emerged through BristolBridge: 
? Avison (Cellular and Molecular Medicine/BristolBridge) and Turner (Veterinary Sciences/BristolBridge) met during the development of the BristolBridge grant application and subsequently (with University of Bristol colleagues) applied for, and were awarded, cross-council AMR Theme 3 funding for NERC-led 'Understanding Real World Interactions'. 
? Homer (Eng. Maths/BristolBridge) and Turner (Vet. Sciences /BristolBridge) had not worked together before BristolBridge and now have a 'plus' funded project together and one with Reyher (Veterinary Sciences)
? Avison (Cellular and Molecular Medicine/BristolBridge) met Dillingham (Biochemistry) at the Research Strand 1 Brainstorm event and discussed a project idea that led to preliminary data collection, via two PhD students, which has been submitted for publication in ELife with Dale Wigley (Imperial College) with EPSRC acknowledged, and has been used to support a &amp;pound;1.5M Wellcome Trust Collaborative Award preliminary application (currently in review). 
? Bullock (Computer Science) was introduced (via written introduction) by Spreadbury to Homer (Engineering Maths and Turner (Veterinary Sciences/Social and Community Medicine) and subsequently Reyher (Veterinary Sciences). Their project was successfully funded in the 2nd round when Bullock joined the team and helped develop the proposal. 
? Barbour (Oral and Dental Sciences), Barrett and Tisdall (Veterinary Sciences) met at the World Caf&amp;eacute;. They funded a summer student and are now offering an iCASE PhD project with the BBSRC SWBio DTP to work on the infection digital dermatitis in cattle, to be supervised by Barrett, Spencer and Tisdall with Barbour as the industrial partner (Barbour has a spin out company Pertinax Pharma Ltd). 
? Hill (Cellular and Molecular Medicine), Turner (Veterinary Sciences), Muir (Public Health England), Williams (Bristol Royal Infirmary), Crosby (Chemistry), Bullock (Computer Science) and Perriman (Cellular and Molecular Medicine) got together at the World Caf&amp;eacute; to start developing a project to find new ways of treating gonorrhoea. Spreadbury facilitated further meetings to enable them to work up their application and it was funded in our 2nd funding round. Since then, the collaboration has evolved to include Gallagher (Chemistry/Dean of Science) and his PhD student RegoCampello (Chemistry) to work on additional chemistry aspects. Davies (Chemistry) and Hughes-Games (EPSRC-funded Bristol Centre for Functional Materials CDT) and now Hill's PhD student, are working on understanding molecular interactions using atomic force microscopy. Hill's overall project has recently been awarded an extension of 'plus' funding. 
? Hendry (Earth Sciences) was introduced to Avison and Spencer by Spreadbury at the Inaugural Conference so she could discuss her collection of deep sea sponges which may harbour bacteria which produce novel natural products. After preliminary studies with Avison and Spencer over the summer, she is now offering a PhD project on this topic under the GW4 Biomed MRC DTP with Curnow (Biochemistry; lead supervisor), Race (Biochemistry) Avison and Spencer (Cellular and Molecular Medicine) and Willis (Chemistry). 
? Miles (Physics and NuNano Ltd) and Borman (Public Health England, National Mycology Reference Lab) met at the Inaugural Conference. Borman saw potential for Miles's technology (presented at the conference) to be applied for detecting antifungal resistance rapidly (their project was funded in 3rd round).
? Gersen (Physics) and Avison (Cellular and Molecular Medicine) built a new collaboration to submit a proposal for our 2nd funding round (funded). 
? Spencer (Cellular and Molecular Medicine/BristolBridge) met Cooper (KCMC) through Spreadbury and Mulholland and Spencer &amp;amp; Cooper have a collaborative project with Galan (Chemistry) and RedX Pharma funded by EPSRC Insititutional Sponsorship 2016.

How do the undertaken events/activities relate to the impact and engagement plans detailed in your 'Pathway to Impact' statement?
Happy to share with network [ y ]
Happy to share beyond network [ y ] ? All the events undertaken have helped in breaking down barriers to collaboration and have initiated new collaborations between EPS investigators and microbiologists, clinicians, vets, dentists and life scientists. 
? The cross-strand World Caf&amp;eacute; and Inaugural Conference, in particular, have been instrumental in promoting engagement with clinical (including veterinary) stakeholders - Prof. Alastair Hay, (practising GP, Social and Community Medicine), Prof. Alasadair MacGowan and colleagues at Southmead Hospital, Dr Amber Young (Healing Foundation Children's Burns Centre), Prof. David Barrett (Vet. School), Dr Martin Williams (Bristol Royal Infirmary), Public Health England and the National Mycology Reference Lab (Bristol's clinical microbiology services).
? 'Plus'-funded projects have co-applicants from University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, Public Health England and Langford Vets. 
? The critical friend scheme has been implemented by Avison and Spencer to help to discuss scientific issues and develop ideas with PIs who have applied for 'plus' funding but and were not funded. 
? We have increasing interaction with industry (SMEs) which includes formal collaborative research with RedX Pharma (Galan, Spencer &amp;amp; Cooper) and Avison (microbiological testing) and partnerships with Selcia (Spencer and Mulholland) and Pertinax Pharma (Barbour). A keynote lecture was given by Selcia's Director of Drug Discovery at our Inaugural Conference. Diagnostics workshop held with the Institute of Bio-Sensing Technology; meeting with Randox; participation in the EBI Biomedical and Health Sciences Industry Day (Spreadbury on steering committee/hosted a BristolBridge stand &amp;amp; commissioned posters). We have met with the head of KTN Health, Dr Terry O'Neill, and the EEN SW to discuss opportunities for translating outcomes from the most promising 'plus' funded projects. Several activities are planned with the EEN SW including translation and commercialisation surgeries and help with our Industry Day in May 2017. 
? We have launched a BristolBridge AMR CrossFire live streamed video series, devised by Hauert, and hosted on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjZ6fYNvw_8Mhr4OSWCvsSw) as an educational resource to promote cross-disciplinary developments to fight AMR. The videos present basic concepts relevant to AMR research in a way that is accessible, regardless of research background, and in a way that empowers investigators to use this knowledge in their own research.
? Engagement with the public and education has been achieved through holding a Schools Conference on Antibiotics and Antibiotic Resistance Science for 160 post 16-yr pupils and teachers from the SW region (lectures and hands-on, discovery-led activities). This was organised by BristolBridge (particularly Spreadbury, Spencer &amp;amp; Mulholland) with support from Bristol ChemLabS outreach team; Avison gave a presentation on AMR at the Sidmouth Science Festival 'Science on the Prom' in October 2016 and he also regularly visits schools to talk on AMR (approx. 20 per year); BristolBridge are consultants for Surgeon X AMR comic (http://surgeonx.co.uk/) which is funded by the Wellcome Trust and the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC). Spreadbury has liaised with and facilitated ongoing communications with author Sara Kenney. Avison recorded podcasts for the Surgeon X app and Mulholland, Hughes ('plus'-funded postdoc) and Walker (Chemical Synthesis PhD student) have all contributed scientific knowledge and expertise to help Kenney develop storylines for a new chemical scientist character. Mulholland, Hughes and Walker also received media training by BBC Radio and social media training by a social media strategist (VCCP Kin) as part of a recent Surgeon X workshop in London. 
? Training - BristolBridge (Spencer, Avison &amp;amp; Murillo - 'plus' funded postdoc) has trained 30 postdoctoral scientists and PhD students predominantly from the engineering and physical sciences in microbiological techniques. Turner and Homer organised a cross-campus R users workshop with the Bristol-based MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit for statistical computing and graphics. Avison was invited by the ESRC to record a video on AMR to help engage social scientists for the ESRC-led AMR Theme 4 funding call. Seddon liaised with Tavar&amp;eacute; to win EBI funding for a clinical immersion programme whereby BCFN students working on 'Materials for Health and the Life Sciences' spent a night shift with the ambulance service to understand how bacterial cross contamination occurs inside an ambulance and how this could inform the design of new nanomaterials to prevent this. 
How have events/activities developed over the course of the award?
Happy to share with network [ y ]
Happy to share beyond network [ y ] There has been a natural progression from foundation activities leading to more specific and focused activities through to events focused on AMR as a Global Challenge. 
Once the BristolBridge application had been awarded, separate brainstorming sessions (one for each Research Strand) were held during the summer of 2015 to start nucleating investigators from diverse fields of expertise who may have ideas to contribute for collaborative proposals for pump-primimg research in our three Research Strands. 
The official launch presided over by our new Vice Chancellor (a clinician) was a 'call to arms' for the University of Bristol to get involved in tackling AMR and to advertise that 'plus' funding was available for innovative interdisciplinary projects. 
The cross-strand World Caf&amp;eacute; was an event designed to bring all disciplines together to hear the most pressing clinical and veterinary AMR challenges set out by practitioners working in the field; a chance to ask questions (expert panel discussion) and an opportunity to start developing and pitching project proposals linked to our 2nd funding call. 
The Inaugural Conference focused on inviting presentations from engineers, physical scientists and mathematicians to show how their technologies may have potential application in helping to tackle AMR. 
We are now focusing on AMR as a global challenge and we have a month of funded activities planned with investigators from Thailand and SE Asia in March 2017 funded predominantly by our EPSRC Institutional Sponsorship 2016 award .

2.Summary and Reflections of 'plus' funding
(see Table 2A in annex to add more event specific detail)
Management of ethical approvals (human and animal)
Happy to share with network [ y ]
Happy to share beyond network [ y ] None required to date. The Elizabeth Blackwell Institute for Health Research (EBI) provides oversight and monitoring of the BristolBridge project and advises as required. 
One follow-on funded project by Antognozzi (Physics) has required ethical approval to conduct studies re. clinical validity of his primary care device, but this was undertaken by the School involved (Social and Community Medicine). 
How was (and will) the feasibility funds managed and awarded? Has the strategy evolved over the award?
Happy to share with network [ y ]
Happy to share beyond network [ y ] The feasibility funds were/are managed by the BristolBridge Manager (Spreadbury), the School of Chemistry's Account Manager (Faculty of Science Finance team) and the Management Group. The Management Group meet every 8 weeks, in addition to networking events, to discuss progress and Review Panel meetings are held to review applications and award funds to 'plus' funded projects. 
The strategy was to front load the BristolBridge project by awarding the majority of 'plus' funding in year 1 in order to maximise the outcomes/impact in year 2. 
How does the research supported so far relate to the original funding application?
Happy to share with network [ y ]
Happy to share beyond network [ y ] We have funded research across all three Research Strands that were identified in the original funding application. Strand 1 (drug discovery, assays and diagnostics) has received the most funding, so far, with seven funded projects, Strand 2 (antimicrobial materials and devices) has had three funded projects and Strand 3 (AMR surveillance) two funded projects. Some early proposals related to ideas mentioned in the original proposal; but most have arisen from new collaborations initiated through BristolBridge.

Future potential call ideas and scoping activities
Happy to share with network [ y ]
Happy to share beyond network [ y ] We believe the Bridging the Gaps programme is a very successful model in Bristol and in other universities. 
We are keen to see follow-on support for this interdisciplinary initiative in AMR. There is real potential for EPS to help combat this global problem. We would suggest an extension of BtG funding with highlighted activities across, and with the other research councils. 
AMR aligns exceptionally well with EPSRC strategies in the Health Technologies Grand Challenges and the Healthy Nation outcome and there is potential here for strategically important areas for EPSRC, ranging from fundamental physical sciences, maths and engineering to technological development and translation. 
We have had three standard calls and one Global Challenge focused call to distribute institutional EPSRC funds where proposals were required to fulfil EPSRC remit and ODA compliance. We have funds remaining for a further (5th) funding round. 
Avison (Cellular and Molecular Medicine/BristolBridge) and Spreadbury (BristolBridge) attended the AHRC Town meeting on 30th November to scope opportunities in Theme 3b of the RCUK cross-council AMR initiative, &amp;quot;Understanding Real World Interactions in the Indoor and Built Environment&amp;quot;. Avison was one of four speakers, covering the topic of &amp;quot;Interdisciplinary AMR Research&amp;quot;

Happy to share with network [ y ]
Happy to share beyond network [ y ] Spreadbury is an associate member of the Research Development team in Research and Enterprise Development, and routinely highlights strategic opportunities to the BristolBridge management group and the wider Bristol AMR network. These are promoted across our network through direct emails and via the BristolBridge Newsletter (circulation 213), website and Twitter. She also promotes the other Bridging the Gaps AMR network activities as appropriate. 
Strategic opportunities highlighted include the Longitude Prize, JPIAMR 3rd and 4th calls (one PI applied), AMR cross-council ESRC-led Theme 4 (three applications submitted with Bristol Co-Is), EPSRC GCRF funding awarded to the University of Bristol (one of our PIs was successful, Barbour). AMR cross-council AHRC-led Theme 3b call (Avison and Spreadbury attended Town Meeting to gain further insights/intelligence on the call).
We have also highlighted the recent Dept. Health/Innovate UK Equipment call to build capacity in AMR. An application has been submitted by Avison (Cellular and Molecular Medicine/BristolBridge) with MacGowan (North Bristol NHS Trust). 
We were disappointed that Bridging the Gaps funded projects were excluded from applying to the EPSRC &amp;quot;Healthcare Impact Partnerships&amp;quot; call particularly since AMR Theme 2 was one of the strategic themes of the call. Both 'plus' funded Barbour (Oral and Dental Sciences/BristolBridge) and Antognozzi (Physics) would have been in a position to apply. 
Turner submitted an EoI for a Fellowship application to EPSRC &amp;quot;Healthcare Technologies Grand Challenges&amp;quot; on &amp;quot;Personalised treatment of infections in community settings to control AMR&amp;quot; and will submit full application in January 2017. 
The EPSRC &amp;quot;New Approaches to Data Science&amp;quot; call has been highlighted to investigators working in our AMR surveillance research strand (Research Strand 3) and One Health (Turner, Homer, Reyher, Bullock, Dowsey and Avison) and we are planning a meeting with the University's newest Research Institute - the Jean Golding Institute for Data Science on the role of data science in tackling AMR. 
We have also canvassed our 'plus' funded PIs and the strategic EPSRC opportunities they have identified for their 'plus' funded projects are predominantly 'Developing Future Therapies' and 'Optimising Treatments' in the Healthcare Technologies Grand Challenge ambitions but all of the Challenge ambitions were represented over our 12 pump-priming projects. In terms of the EPSRC Healthy Nations outcome, our 'plus' funded projects encompass all outcomes (H1-H5). 
What opportunities have arisen as a result of this award that would otherwise not been possible or much harder to achieve?
Max 1 page.
Happy to share with network [ y ]
Happy to share beyond network [ y ] This award with its embedded ability to fund networking events, fund pump-priming projects and the salary support for a dedicated Manager to help design and facilitate all BristolBridge activities has meant that BristolBridge has been very successful in achieving its aim to nucleate, stimulate and develop interdisciplinary projects across the University of Bristol and beyond (including bringing in collaborators in LMICs using follow-on funding). We have been able to respond flexibly and act quickly to fund potentially transformative ideas emerging from networking events. 
The BristolBridge award has brought physical scientists, engineers, mathematicians and computer scientists into the AMR arena, and as a result, is applying or developing, new techniques, tools and assays to help tackle AMR on multiple fronts. These projects would have been very difficult to fund elsewhere. 
Additionally, as all the EPS members of the BristolBridge management team are now actively working in the AMR arena, other funding opportunities have since arisen for which they are applying to help tackle AMR problems which they may have not considered before their involvement with BristolBridge.

BristolBridge has achieved many of its core aims already with the funds awarded and represents excellent value for money for the extent and breadth of interdisciplinary research it has initiated across Bristol. The funding for a full-time Manager and Research Facilitator has been integral to the success of Bristol's bridging the gaps project in year 1. Spreadbury has designed and organised very effective networking events which have generated a lot of interest, and goodwill, from both the EPS and biomedical communities. She independently and successfully manages relationships both within and beyond the network, particularly in relation to creating opportunities for realising impact (e.g. with Colin Cooper at the KCMC, Susie Williams at the EEN SW, Sara Kenney at Surgeon X/Wowbagger productions and new contacts in Thailand regarding liaison for our 'Bristol Tackling Global Challenges' week). She is an associate member of the Research Development (RD) Team in Research and Enterprise Development (RED) and attends their bi-monthly team meetings. This has enabled her to receive intelligence on RCUK's and other funding opportunities and benefit from wider issues discussed surrounding research development/follow-on funding. Her close links with the RD team means that the Faculty Research Development Managers and Institute Managers in all six Faculties and the four University Research Institutes (EBI, Cabot, Brigstowe and Jean Golding), respectively, are regularly apprised of BristolBridge's activities and funding calls and this helps to inform a campus-wide audience. She has also engaged members of the RD team to attend BristolBridge events which has been helpful in raising awareness of wider AMR funding opportunities. The BristolBridge project has expanded into related areas of AMR research and Spreadbury works closely with other players to facilitate further networking/potential funding opportunities - e.g. helping to engage the BristolBridge network with the ESRC AMR Champion's (Lambert) joint and reciprocal Bristol-Aarhus University workshop on interdisciplinary AMR working. BristolBridge initiated &amp;quot;Bristol Tackling Global Challenges&amp;quot; on receipt of its EPSRC Institutional Sponsorship funding for a joint Bristol-Thailand AMR workshop and Spreadbury is currently working with the BrisSynBio Manager, Sedgley, to expand this to incorporate a week of related BrisSynBio workshops funded via the BBSRC GCRF on Natural Product Discovery in SE Asia (Project Co-lead Mulholland) and Vaccine Development (Project Co-lead Turner). 
The BristolBridge management group members and 'plus' funded PIs have attended other Bridging the Gaps AMR network activities. Mulholland and Spreadbury attended the NAMRA/NAMRIP meeting in Southampton on 25/08/15. Su (Oral and Dental Sciences) gave an invited talk on &amp;quot;Bioinspired antimicrobial surfaces for medical implants&amp;quot; at the SHAMROK workshop on Antimicrobial Surfaces in Sheffield on 06/04/16; Seddon and Spreadbury attended the Annual AMR Networks meeting at Sheffield on 02/09/16; Barbour (Oral and Dental Sciences) attended the Antimicrobial Research Collaborative (ARC) Conference at Imperial College on 22/09/16 and Reyher (Veterinary Sciences) gave an invited presentation on &amp;quot;How can auditing supply chains address the responsible use of antibiotics&amp;quot; at the NAMRIP and Food Standards Agency (FSA) meeting on 'Food retailers, supply chains and the antimicrobial resistance challenge' in London on 25/11/16. 
Finally, the BristolBridge PI (Mulholland) and Co-Is (Avison, Spencer, Seddon, Barbour, Hauert, Turner, Homer and Tavar&amp;eacute;) also have their own AMR and AMR-related research activities, which while not directly supported by BristolBridge 'plus' funding activities, have benefited from additional collaboration through BristolBridge, involving new investigators which help to inform BristolBridge and its wider activities within the University. Many are PIs and Co-Is on other major AMR grants:

Activity Inaugural BristolBridge Conference held at Engineers House, Bristol on &amp;quot;Meeting the Challenge of Antimicrobial Resistance through the Advances in the Engineering and Physical Sciences&amp;quot;
1st most expensive
2nd most influential 
Date 08/04/16
Aim To showcase the first pump-priming projects we had funded and also to demonstrate how physical sciences and engineering technologies, techniques and tools could be applied to tackling AMR. Physicists, engineers, mathematicians, modellers and bioinformaticians were invited to give presentations along with clinicians and industry. Posters and flash presentations by postdocs and PhD students were also invited. 
Target Audience University of Bristol academics, postdoctoral researchers, PhD students, industry, NHS Trusts, other Bridging the Gaps network projects. 
Key Performance Indicators (KPI)
(i.e. number of people attending, audience type, number of institutions/disciplines represented, outputs (new collaborations, applications for 'plus' funds)) 107 people attended. 
Audience: Faculty Deans, academics, postdocs, PhD students, clinicians, vets, dental scientists, industry, research council (EPSRC), Research Development and Research Commercialisation Managers.
11 institutions: University of Bristol, University of the West of England (UWE), University of Bath, Aston University (AMR4AMR), Imperial College (EMBRACE), University of Liverpool, EPSRC (Dr Jane Nicholson), Selcia Ltd (Dr Vicky Steadman, Director of Drug Discovery), Institute of Bio-Sensing Technology, Healing Children's Burns Research Centre (based at the Bristol Children's Hospital), Public Health England National Mycology Reference Laboratory. 
Disciplines: Physics, Mechanical Engineering, Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Chemistry, Engineering Maths, Computer Science, Earth Sciences, Biochemistry, Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Social and Community Medicine, Veterinary Sciences, Oral and Dental Sciences
Outputs: New collaborations resulting in three applications for 'plus' funded projects (proposals by PIs Miles (Physics) and Seddon (Physics/BristolBridge) were subsequently funded) and preliminary studies resulting in offered PhD project with the GW4 Biomed MRC DTP (Curnow, Hendry, Race, Spencer, Avison and Willis). 
Relationship to 'pathway to impact' statement A conference was part of our planning as detailed in the Case and meets the following goals in our pathways to impact: 
Breaking down barriers to collaboration 
Engagement with clinical stakeholders
Increasing interaction with industry 
Successes Spreadbury and Spencer worked up their idea, facilitated by Seddon, Turner and Homer, to involve and engage Bristol's physical scientists and engineers (none of those invited had 'plus' funding at that stage) to give presentations on their technologies which may have potential application in helping to tackle AMR. This was instrumental in showcasing Bristol's EPS community and bringing them directly into contact with their biomedical counterparts. 
The team successfully worked together to shape the programme. For the external and keynote presentations, Spreadbury invited Dr Andrew Dowsey (then University of Liverpool but due to take up a Chair at Bristol in July 2016) to present his data science approach to 'One Health'. He is now collaborating widely with Turner, Reyher (Veterinary Sciences) and Avison on AMR surveillance and diagnostics. Spencer successfully engaged the Director of Drug Discovery at Selcia Ltd (Dr Vicky Steadman), Barbour engaged Dr Amber Young from the Healing Foundation Children's Burns Research Centre, University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, Turner engaged Prof. Ed Feil (Bath) and Seddon suggested Gallagher (Dean of Science/Chemistry) to close the meeting and his participation was secured by Mulholland. 
The conference resulted in new collaborations being made which generated 3 applications for 'plus' funding and the award of 2 pump-priming projects for Miles (Physics) with Borman (National Mycology Reference Lab) and Seddon (Physics/BristolBridge), Hughes (Mech. Eng) and Spencer (Cellular and Molecular Medicine/BristolBridge). 
Seddon, Hughes and Spencer's 'plus' funded project has been extended by one month; they have also expanded the remit of their work to bring in Turner (Vet Sciences/Social and Community Medicine/BristolBridge) and Gibson (Biological Sciences) and attracted further funding via EPSRC Institutional Sponsorship 2016 support which also supports collaborative links with Thailand and Kenya and funding for collaborative visits. 
Hendry (Earth Sciences) was introduced to Spencer and Avison (both Cellular and Molecular Medicine/BristolBridge) which led to meetings, preliminary studies and an offered PhD project on &amp;quot;New antimicrobials from deep sea sponges&amp;quot; with the GW4 Biomed MRC DTP.

Challenges No major challenges
Summary
 A very successful first conference with a wide range of attendees from the University and other institutions. The enthusiastic input from the researchers presenting the results from the first pump-priming projects, PhD students and postdocs (giving 'flash' 3 minute oral presentations and posters) lent another exciting dimension. 
Feedback: &amp;quot;The BristolBridge team has fostered a really good community of interesting, interested, proactive and collegiate researchers, and you are to be highly commended for it!&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;It was a pleasure and a privilege to talk at such a fascinating and high quality meeting. I very much enjoyed it and was amazed by some of the science taking place&amp;quot;.
&amp;quot;The day was extremely enjoyable. It was a pleasure to hear of the breadth and depth of the research and also to have the chance to talk to the presenters and other University of Bristol academics. In particular, I greatly enjoyed talking to people from such a wide interdisciplinary collection of topics in a relaxed atmosphere&amp;quot;.

Activity Cross-strand World Caf&amp;eacute; at Bristol Zoo Gardens
2nd most expensive
1st most influential
Date 19/01/16
Aim 1. To set out the challenge of AMR from the perspective of healthcare professionals in primary care, secondary care and veterinary medicine in farming and livestock production for investigators outside the field to understand what problems need to be addressed. 
2. Facilitated World Caf&amp;eacute; session to brainstorm questions relating to specific challenges/problems followed by reporting discussion outcome to the room.
3. Expert panel discussion (clinical &amp;amp; EPS panellists) - audience told that &amp;quot;no question is too stupid to ask&amp;quot; 
4. Small group working to start developing interdisciplinary pump-priming projects and short project pitches 
Target Audience Cross-Faculty University of Bristol academics particularly those working in engineering, mathematical and physical sciences, microbiology/infectious diseases, clinicians, vets, dental scientists, clinical microbiologists working in NHS hospital pathology laboratories. 
Key Performance Indicators (KPI)
(i.e. number of people attending, audience type, number of institutions/disciplines represented, outputs (new collaborations, applications for 'plus' funds)) 75 people attended 
Audience: Academic staff from 4 of the 6 University of Bristol Faculties (Biomedical Sciences, Health Sciences, Science and Engineering), postdoctoral research staff, clinicians, vets, dental scientists, clinical microbiologists from Public Health England pathology labs, Research Development Managers and other Project Managers (e.g. from the Centre of Academic Primary Care). 
5 Institutions: University of Bristol, University of Swansea, Public Health England, North Bristol NHS Trust (Southmead Hospital) and University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust (Bristol Royal Infirmary) 
Disciplines: Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, Engineering Mathematics, Computer Science, Complexity Sciences, Mechanical Engineering, Biochemistry, Biological Sciences, Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Veterinary Sciences, Oral and Dental Sciences and Social and Community Medicine. 
Outputs: New collaborative proposals, for example from: 
Hill, Crosby, Perriman, Turner, Williams and colleagues
Picco, Payton and Leeming 
Bullock, Reyher, Brooks-Pollock, Tasker and Danon

12 applications for 'plus' funding 
Barbour, Barrett, Spencer and Tisdall now have a joint iCASE PhD project 
Relationship to 'pathway to impact' statement A World Caf&amp;eacute; event was part of our planning as detailed in the Case and meets the following goals in our pathways to impact: 
Breaking down barriers to collaboration
Engagement with clinical stakeholders
Successes An atmosphere buzzing with enthusiasm and a commitment to tackle AMR. Holding the event away from the University meant that people were focused on the aims of the event and stayed the whole day. The surroundings and catering at Bristol Zoo Gardens also contributed to the success of the event and the feeling of both goodwill and a valuable day spent away from the office/lab. Many academics commented on how liberating it was to spend a whole day discussing research. 
Spreadbury initiated and secured the participation of Prof. Alastair Hay, a practising GP and Professor of Primary Care (Social and Community Medicine) and Prof. David Barrett Professor of Bovine Medicine, Reproduction and Production (Veterinary Sciences). Spencer secured Prof Alasdair MacGowan, Professor of Antimicrobial Therapeutics, North Bristol NHS Trust. Spreadbury worked with them all to ensure they understood that their particular role was to highlight the challenges of AMR from their clinical/veterinary perspectives in a way that a diverse audience of different expertises could understand. They all gave superb keynote clinical presentations and participated in all the day's activities. 
6 projects were informally pitched and new collaborations were initiated. Some went on to develop applications for 'plus' funds - 12 applications received in funding round 2. 
55% increase in submitted applications compared to the first funding round.
For more details on this event, please see: 
http://www.bristol.ac.uk/bristolbridge/news/2016/cross-strand-amr-world-cafe.html
Challenges The short amount of time to pinpoint the key areas which needed to be discussed after challenges were set out in the clinical and veterinary keynote presentations 
Summary
 The World Caf&amp;eacute; was viewed, and is still viewed, as a very successful event which employed a format for the day which was both highly engaging and productive. The official launch was inspiring but the World Caf&amp;eacute; embedded the view by Bristol investigators that BristolBridge events were worth attending. Subsequently, the conference was very well attended too and smaller workshops and training events have been similarly well patronised. 
We heard that the event was much discussed with people who could not/did not attend and it was also flagged at a School Research Committee meeting as being a highly successful event. 
It was satisfying to see that many attendees had ideas for projects they wanted to discuss with potential new collaborators they had met during the day and self-organised groups quickly fell into place. During small group working, ideas for projects emerged very quickly and six exciting project proposals were pitched by the end of the afternoon
Feedback: A facilitator commented that &amp;quot;There seemed to be a tremendous amount of energy and enthusiasm for collaborating and making exciting things happen&amp;quot;. 
Turner (Veterinary Sciences/BristolBridge) reported &amp;quot;Lots of people said afterwards how collaborative and willing people were to go a bit outside their comfort zones and ask stupid/obvious questions. So easy to forget we don't all know about atomic force microscopy and synovial fluid. I heard lots of questions asked that would have been difficult or impossible in another context - if that's not bridging the gaps I don't know what is&amp;quot;.

Activity BristolBridge Official Launch
4th most expensive
3rd most influential
Date 11/11/15
Aim To officially launch the BristolBridge project to the University of Bristol. A 'call to arms' to encourage investigators in the physical sciences, mathematics and engineering disciplines to engage with their counterparts in the life sciences, human and veterinary medicine to tackle the problem of AMR. The idea for a launch came from Avison who sensed that interest may have waned since the brainstorming sessions held in the summer and the time taken to appoint the Manager and Research Facilitator (Spreadbury) who took up her post in October. 
Target Audience University of Bristol and Bristol NHS Trusts 
Key Performance Indicators (KPI)
(i.e. number of people attending, audience type, number of institutions/disciplines represented, outputs (new collaborations, applications for 'plus' funds)) 130 people attended
Audience: The Vice Chancellor, Prof. Hugh Brady; the Pro Vice Chancellor (Research) Prof. Nishan Canagarajah, the Deans and (some) Faculty Research Directors of the Faculties of Engineering, Science, Biomedical Sciences and Health Sciences, academics, postdoctoral researchers, PhD students including from the BCFN and ACCIS Centres for Doctoral Training, Heads of School, Research and Enterprise Development, Finance staff involved in the original application
3 Institutions: University of Bristol, North Bristol NHS Trust and University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust 

Disciplines: Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, Engineering Maths, Mechanical Engineering, Aerospace Engineering, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Civil Engineering, Computer Science, Complexity Sciences, Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Biochemistry, Biological Sciences, Veterinary Sciences, Oral and Dental Sciences, Social and Community Medicine 
Outputs: The excellent and engaging talks by Brady, Tavar&amp;eacute;, Avison, Mulholland and Lambert, the excellent vibe and good humoured atmosphere - and complimentary wine and food - generated a lot of goodwill and laid the foundation for investigators to be interested in attending future BristolBridge events and undertake interdisciplinary working.
Relationship to 'pathway to impact' statement An official launch event was not part of our planning as detailed in the Case but clearly an excellent format to attract diverse expertise and galvanise interdisciplinary collaboration. The launch meets the following goals in our pathways to impact: 
Breaking down barriers to collaboration 
Engagement with cinical stakeholders
Successes Spreadbury engaging the new Vice Chancellor to preside over the launch. The successful design and organisation (at fairly short notice) of the launch event by Spreadbury and its promotion by Spreadbury and Mulholland, in particular, to ensure an excellent turnout and a large number of poster presentations. Thought provoking and engaging presentations in which Brady gave a thoughtful opening address reflecting on his clinical experience and frustration at seeing his former renal patients die of infection and how opportune BristolBridge was in tackling the the problem of AMR. Tavar&amp;eacute; (Elizabeth BIackwell Institute/BristolBridge) praised the highly collaborative and collegiate research environment at Bristol which would help to engender the interdisciplinary research needed to ensure BristolBridge's mission to bridge the gaps between the EPS and biomedical communities. Mulholland (Chemistry/BristolBridge) poignantly reminded the audience that the launch was being held on Remembrance Day and that World War II was the dawn of the antibiotic era; an era which heralded modern medicine, and now, just 80 years later, has left us facing an antibiotic apocalypse. Avison (Cellular and Molecular Medicine/BristolBridge) outlined the challenge of the problem, the need to understand transmission of AMR in the environment and the role we can all play in reducing antibiotic overuse and stewardship of the antibiotics we have. He also showcased the wider AMR research already taking place at the University of Bristol in tackling this. Lambert - the ESRC National AMR Champion (Social and Community Medicine) highlighted the importance of social science in helping to tackle AMR in an interdisciplinary manner. Mulholland concluded by launching the second funding round. For more details on this event, please see:
http://www.bristol.ac.uk/bristolbridge/news/2015/official-launch.html
Challenges No major challenges but a lot of energy and commitment required from Spreadbury and Mulholland, in particular, to ensure as wide participation as possible. 
Summary
 A vibrant event which got everyone talking about the challenge of AMR and enthusiastic about tackling the problem in interdisciplinary ways. Tavar&amp;eacute; (Elizabeth Blackwell Institute/BristolBridge) challenged everyone to discuss at least one idea for tackling the problem of AMR with another attendee during the wine and cheese reception which followed the presentations. The event helped to publicise BristolBridge and its aims and also generated a lot of goodwill for future networking events and appetite for applying for 'plus' funding. The design and format of the launch was pivotal in generating a very positive, high energy atmosphere with lots of opportunity for extensive networking (pre-event welcome drinks and poster presentations too).

Activity Visit by RedX Pharma 
4th most expensive 
4th most influential? Hard to judge but arguably the most influential in terms of impact re. industrial engagement 
Date 11-12th May 2016
Aim To follow up on a visit initiated by Colin Cooper (KCMC Manager/School of Chemistry) and made by both Cooper and Mulholland (Chemistry/BristolBridge) in February 2016. RedX were interested in collaborating to help them overcome some problems with an antimicrobial compound they were trying to repurpose from Gram-positive to broader activity. They were also interested in engaging help from our Chemistry colleagues to help overcome a formulation problem with a lead compound. 
Following the execution of a mutual confidentiality agreement between the University of Bristol and RedX Pharma (facilitated by Cooper and Spreadbury), we invited three of them to spend two days in Bristol to discuss mutually beneficial research. 
Target Audience Two part visit: Dinner with RedX delegates attended by Gallagher (Dean of Science/School of Chemistry), Cooper (KCMC/Chemistry), Mulholland (Chemistry/BristolBridge), Spencer, Avison (both Cellular and Molecular Medicine/BristolBridge) and Spreadbury (BristolBridge)
Day 2 workshop: PIs and Co-Is from 'plus' funded projects, particularly relating to microbiology and drug discovery, at the University of Bristol were invited and PIs from the School of Chemistry were invited who would be able to advise and collaborate. 
RedX Pharma's Business Development and Alliance Manager, Dr Kate Lower, gave an introductory presentation about RedX Pharma's portfolio of research for drug discovery and two scientists gave presentations outlining the problems they required collaborative help with. 
The RedX visitors toured the School of Chemistry research facilities and had one-to-one meetings with several academics. 
We also invited Bailey and Lazarus (Biological Sciences and Co-Is on 'plus' funded BristolBridge project) and PI and Co-I, respectively, on AMR cross-council Theme 2 funded consortium award on &amp;quot;Exploring Natures Silent Pharmacy&amp;quot; to give a presentation on their work for a systems-based platform for the production of novel antibiotics. 
Key Performance Indicators (KPI)
(i.e. number of people attending, audience type, number of institutions/disciplines represented, outputs (new collaborations, applications for 'plus' funds)) 15 people attended the workshop
Audience: Senior academics (PI/Co-I) from the Schools of Chemistry, Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Biochemistry and Biological Sciences. 
Disciplines: Microbiology, drug discovery investigators, chemists including experts in NMR, computational chemistry, materials chemistry, organic chemistry (molecular conformation), synthetic and biological chemistry 
Outputs: New collaborations and funding as Carmen Galan (Chemistry), Spencer (Cellular and Molecular Medicine/BristolBridge) and Cooper (KCMC/Chemistry) went on to successfully apply for an EPSRC Institutional Sponsorship 2016 funded project. 
Relationship to 'pathway to impact' statement Stimulating interactions with industry was planned in our Case and this event meets the following goals in our pathways to impact: 
Increasing interaction with industry
Successes An example of proactive and professional industrial engagement initiated by Cooper (KCMC/Chemistry and facilitated by Cooper, Mulholland and Spreadbury for the benefit of BristolBridge and other investigators based in the School of Chemistry. 
Chemists led by Craig Butts (Chemistry) undertook contract research to solve a significant problem with a lead compound. 
Galan (Chemistry), Spencer (Cellular and Molecular Medicine/BristolBridge) and Cooper (KCMC/Chemistry) went on to successfully apply for an EPSRC Institutional Sponsorship 2016 funded project. 
Challenges The only challenge was finding a date when all the most important stakeholders could attend. 
Summary
 A productive and mutually beneficial visit by RedX Pharma resulting in a funded collaborative project and an impact already generated by our colleagues in the School of Chemistry who have helped to solve a problem with one of RedX Pharma's lead compounds. This industrial-academic transaction has added value and greatly enhanced our relationship with this pharmaceutical company which may potentially lead to preferred or even strategic collaborations in the future. 
Of direct relevance to AMR, was the help required by RedX from University of Bristol investigators to help repurpose an antimicrobial compound. This resulted in a successful application to EPSRC Institutional Sponsorship 2016 for Galan, Spencer and Cooper and are now successfully collaborating with RedX to try and achieve this aim.

Activity Schools Conference on Antibiotics and Antibiotic Resistance Science
5th most expensive
Influence unknown but potentially far reaching and impactful 
Date 09/11/16
Aim To educate and engage the public about antibiotics and AMR with presentations from academics and PhD students working in the field. This was organised by BristolBridge with support from the ChemLabS outreach team (Director, Tim Harrison) 
Target Audience Post 16-year old science pupils and their teachers
Key Performance Indicators (KPI)
(i.e. number of people attending, audience type, number of institutions/disciplines represented, outputs (new collaborations, applications for 'plus' funds)) 160 attended. 
Audience: Post 16-year old pupils (studying AS and A-level Biology and Chemistry) and teachers attended from 9 schools across the southwest region (Bristol, Somerset, Wiltshire and Cornwall)
Relationship to 'pathway to impact' statement This event was part of our planning as detailed in the Case to educate school age children and meets the following goals in our pathways to impact: 
Engagement with the public and education
Successes Seeing the pupils engage so ethusiastically with the demonstrations and activities and also with the PhD students who were running the demonstrations. 
Reading the comments from the pupils to see that Avison's lecture had informed them about antibiotics, AMR and how drug resistant infections occur. Excellent feedback; the teachers particularly liked the demos which ranged from a virtual reality molecular simulation of ?-lactamase to swarming robots to model bacterial biofilms. 
For more details on this event, please see: http://www.bristol.ac.uk/bristolbridge/news/schools-conference-on-antibiotics-and-antibiotic-resistance-science.html 
An article on our Schools Conference will be submitted in March 2017 to be included in the September 2017 issue of Science in School (the European Journal for science teachers http://www.scienceinschool.org/ 
Challenges Mostly organisational - a lot of facilitation and coordination required to develop ideas and the realisation of hands-on, discovery-led activities and demonstrations. 
Summary
 Presentations by Avison (Cellular and Molecular Medicine/BristolBridge) on &amp;quot;The rise and fall of antibiotics&amp;quot;. Paul Walker (Chem Synthesis CDT PhD student) gave a talk on &amp;quot;How do we make new antibiotics&amp;quot; and Catherine Tooke (BBSRC SWBio DTP PhD student) gave a talk on &amp;quot;Nerds vs. antibiotic resistance: Can we use computers to outsmart resistance?&amp;quot; (presented by Mulholland as she was unavailable on the day). The PhD students presenting talks were encouraged to inform the audience about their choices at A-level, degree etc so the pupils could understand their journey into STEM and postgraduate research. 
Hands-on, discovery led demonstrations were given by staff and postgraduates from four Faculties: 
Nano Simbox - Simulations of the Molecular Nano World (Interactive Science Ltd (iSci) and School of Chemistry)
Modelling bacteria using robot swarms (Dept. Engineering Maths &amp;amp; Bristol Robotics Lab)
How penicillin works (Schools of Cellular &amp;amp; Molecular Medicine and Chemistry) 
The bacterial evolution and medicinal chemistry &amp;quot;Arms Race&amp;quot; (School of Cellular &amp;amp; Molecular Medicine and Dept. Engineering Maths) 
Bugs under the microscope (School of Cellular &amp;amp; Molecular Medicine) 
Maths can help fight AMR too! (Dept. Engineering Maths and School of Veterinary Sciences) 
Bacteria get everywhere! How can we design materials to repel them? (Bristol Centre for Functional Materials, School of Physics) 
Game Zone - Play the Superbugs game (BristolBridge)
Antimicrobial resistance - tell us what you know (BristolBridge)
 A very successful event to engage young people which helped to change their attitudes to antibiotics and AMR e.g. &amp;quot;I'm going to wash my hands more because I don't wanna die&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;I realise now how much we need/should reduce the use of antibiotics&amp;quot;; &amp;quot; Never realised how close and urgent this whole issue is&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;Antibiotics need to be used less in farming&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;Not as hopeless as I thought. Excited by the new technology that can help!&amp;quot;
Teacher's feedback: &amp;quot;Many thanks indeed for such an enjoyable and illuminating and relevant afternoon; our girls had been looking forward to this for many weeks! Super and engaging demonstrations and it really made the curriculum come to life. We, as ever, were welcome and the sessions were especially well organised. Our girls especially relished meeting PhD students and learning about their research at the University of Bristol. The lectures were thoroughly enjoyable and enlightening; we have had our horizons broadened! All in all a superb afternoon&amp;quot;.</gtr:description><gtr:id>2DD4479A-6138-4DC0-BE44-99488D046390</gtr:id><gtr:impact>New collaborations that have emerged through BristolBridge: 
? Avison (Cellular and Molecular Medicine/BristolBridge) and Turner (Veterinary Sciences/BristolBridge) met during the development of the BristolBridge grant application and subsequently (with University of Bristol colleagues) applied for, and were awarded, cross-council AMR Theme 3 funding for NERC-led 'Understanding Real World Interactions'. 
? Homer (Eng. Maths/BristolBridge) and Turner (Vet. Sciences /BristolBridge) had not worked together before BristolBridge and now have a 'plus' funded project together and one with Reyher (Veterinary Sciences)
? Avison (Cellular and Molecular Medicine/BristolBridge) met Dillingham (Biochemistry) at the Research Strand 1 Brainstorm event and discussed a project idea that led to preliminary data collection, via two PhD students, which has been submitted for publication in ELife with Dale Wigley (Imperial College) with EPSRC acknowledged, and has been used to support a &amp;pound;1.5M Wellcome Trust Collaborative Award preliminary application (currently in review). 
? Bullock (Computer Science) was introduced (via written introduction) by Spreadbury to Homer (Engineering Maths and Turner (Veterinary Sciences/Social and Community Medicine) and subsequently Reyher (Veterinary Sciences). Their project was successfully funded in the 2nd round when Bullock joined the team and helped develop the proposal. 
? Barbour (Oral and Dental Sciences), Barrett and Tisdall (Veterinary Sciences) met at the World Caf&amp;eacute;. They funded a summer student and are now offering an iCASE PhD project with the BBSRC SWBio DTP to work on the infection digital dermatitis in cattle, to be supervised by Barrett, Spencer and Tisdall with Barbour as the industrial partner (Barbour has a spin out company Pertinax Pharma Ltd). 
? Hill (Cellular and Molecular Medicine), Turner (Veterinary Sciences), Muir (Public Health England), Williams (Bristol Royal Infirmary), Crosby (Chemistry), Bullock (Computer Science) and Perriman (Cellular and Molecular Medicine) got together at the World Caf&amp;eacute; to start developing a project to find new ways of treating gonorrhoea. Spreadbury facilitated further meetings to enable them to work up their application and it was funded in our 2nd funding round. Since then, the collaboration has evolved to include Gallagher (Chemistry/Dean of Science) and his PhD student RegoCampello (Chemistry) to work on additional chemistry aspects. Davies (Chemistry) and Hughes-Games (EPSRC-funded Bristol Centre for Functional Materials CDT) and now Hill's PhD student, are working on understanding molecular interactions using atomic force microscopy. Hill's overall project has recently been awarded an extension of 'plus' funding. 
? Hendry (Earth Sciences) was introduced to Avison and Spencer by Spreadbury at the Inaugural Conference so she could discuss her collection of deep sea sponges which may harbour bacteria which produce novel natural products. After preliminary studies with Avison and Spencer over the summer, she is now offering a PhD project on this topic under the GW4 Biomed MRC DTP with Curnow (Biochemistry; lead supervisor), Race (Biochemistry) Avison and Spencer (Cellular and Molecular Medicine) and Willis (Chemistry). 
? Miles (Physics and NuNano Ltd) and Borman (Public Health England, National Mycology Reference Lab) met at the Inaugural Conference. Borman saw potential for Miles's technology (presented at the conference) to be applied for detecting antifungal resistance rapidly (their project was funded in 3rd round).
? Gersen (Physics) and Avison (Cellular and Molecular Medicine) built a new collaboration to submit a proposal for our 2nd funding round (funded). 
? Spencer (Cellular and Molecular Medicine/BristolBridge) met Cooper (KCMC) through Spreadbury and Mulholland and Spencer &amp;amp; Cooper have a collaborative project with Galan (Chemistry) and RedX Pharma funded by EPSRC Insititutional Sponsorship 2016.

How do the undertaken events/activities relate to the impact and engagement plans detailed in your 'Pathway to Impact' statement?
Happy to share with network [ y ]
Happy to share beyond network [ y ] ? All the events undertaken have helped in breaking down barriers to collaboration and have initiated new collaborations between EPS investigators and microbiologists, clinicians, vets, dentists and life scientists. 
? The cross-strand World Caf&amp;eacute; and Inaugural Conference, in particular, have been instrumental in promoting engagement with clinical (including veterinary) stakeholders - Prof. Alastair Hay, (practising GP, Social and Community Medicine), Prof. Alasadair MacGowan and colleagues at Southmead Hospital, Dr Amber Young (Healing Foundation Children's Burns Centre), Prof. David Barrett (Vet. School), Dr Martin Williams (Bristol Royal Infirmary), Public Health England and the National Mycology Reference Lab (Bristol's clinical microbiology services).
? 'Plus'-funded projects have co-applicants from University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, Public Health England and Langford Vets. 
? The critical friend scheme has been implemented by Avison and Spencer to help to discuss scientific issues and develop ideas with PIs who have applied for 'plus' funding but and were not funded. 
? We have increasing interaction with industry (SMEs) which includes formal collaborative research with RedX Pharma (Galan, Spencer &amp;amp; Cooper) and Avison (microbiological testing) and partnerships with Selcia (Spencer and Mulholland) and Pertinax Pharma (Barbour). A keynote lecture was given by Selcia's Director of Drug Discovery at our Inaugural Conference. Diagnostics workshop held with the Institute of Bio-Sensing Technology; meeting with Randox; participation in the EBI Biomedical and Health Sciences Industry Day (Spreadbury on steering committee/hosted a BristolBridge stand &amp;amp; commissioned posters). We have met with the head of KTN Health, Dr Terry O'Neill, and the EEN SW to discuss opportunities for translating outcomes from the most promising 'plus' funded projects. Several activities are planned with the EEN SW including translation and commercialisation surgeries and help with our Industry Day in May 2017. 
? We have launched a BristolBridge AMR CrossFire live streamed video series, devised by Hauert, and hosted on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjZ6fYNvw_8Mhr4OSWCvsSw) as an educational resource to promote cross-disciplinary developments to fight AMR. The videos present basic concepts relevant to AMR research in a way that is accessible, regardless of research background, and in a way that empowers investigators to use this knowledge in their own research.
? Engagement with the public and education has been achieved through holding a Schools Conference on Antibiotics and Antibiotic Resistance Science for 160 post 16-yr pupils and teachers from the SW region (lectures and hands-on, discovery-led activities). This was organised by BristolBridge (particularly Spreadbury, Spencer &amp;amp; Mulholland) with support from Bristol ChemLabS outreach team; Avison gave a presentation on AMR at the Sidmouth Science Festival 'Science on the Prom' in October 2016 and he also regularly visits schools to talk on AMR (approx. 20 per year); BristolBridge are consultants for Surgeon X AMR comic (http://surgeonx.co.uk/) which is funded by the Wellcome Trust and the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC). Spreadbury has liaised with and facilitated ongoing communications with author Sara Kenney. Avison recorded podcasts for the Surgeon X app and Mulholland, Hughes ('plus'-funded postdoc) and Walker (Chemical Synthesis PhD student) have all contributed scientific knowledge and expertise to help Kenney develop storylines for a new chemical scientist character. Mulholland, Hughes and Walker also received media training by BBC Radio and social media training by a social media strategist (VCCP Kin) as part of a recent Surgeon X workshop in London. 
? Training - BristolBridge (Spencer, Avison &amp;amp; Murillo - 'plus' funded postdoc) has trained 30 postdoctoral scientists and PhD students predominantly from the engineering and physical sciences in microbiological techniques. Turner and Homer organised a cross-campus R users workshop with the Bristol-based MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit for statistical computing and graphics. Avison was invited by the ESRC to record a video on AMR to help engage social scientists for the ESRC-led AMR Theme 4 funding call. Seddon liaised with Tavar&amp;eacute; to win EBI funding for a clinical immersion programme whereby BCFN students working on 'Materials for Health and the Life Sciences' spent a night shift with the ambulance service to understand how bacterial cross contamination occurs inside an ambulance and how this could inform the design of new nanomaterials to prevent this. 
How have events/activities developed over the course of the award?
Happy to share with network [ y ]
Happy to share beyond network [ y ] There has been a natural progression from foundation activities leading to more specific and focused activities through to events focused on AMR as a Global Challenge. 
Once the BristolBridge application had been awarded, separate brainstorming sessions (one for each Research Strand) were held during the summer of 2015 to start nucleating investigators from diverse fields of expertise who may have ideas to contribute for collaborative proposals for pump-primimg research in our three Research Strands. 
The official launch presided over by our new Vice Chancellor (a clinician) was a 'call to arms' for the University of Bristol to get involved in tackling AMR and to advertise that 'plus' funding was available for innovative interdisciplinary projects. 
The cross-strand World Caf&amp;eacute; was an event designed to bring all disciplines together to hear the most pressing clinical and veterinary AMR challenges set out by practitioners working in the field; a chance to ask questions (expert panel discussion) and an opportunity to start developing and pitching project proposals linked to our 2nd funding call. 
The Inaugural Conference focused on inviting presentations from engineers, physical scientists and mathematicians to show how their technologies may have potential application in helping to tackle AMR. 
We are now focusing on AMR as a global challenge and we have a month of funded activities planned with investigators from Thailand and SE Asia in March 2017 funded predominantly by our EPSRC Institutional Sponsorship 2016 award .

2.Summary and Reflections of 'plus' funding
(see Table 2A in annex to add more event specific detail)
Management of ethical approvals (human and animal)
Happy to share with network [ y ]
Happy to share beyond network [ y ] None required to date. The Elizabeth Blackwell Institute for Health Research (EBI) provides oversight and monitoring of the BristolBridge project and advises as required. 
One follow-on funded project by Antognozzi (Physics) has required ethical approval to conduct studies re. clinical validity of his primary care device, but this was undertaken by the School involved (Social and Community Medicine). 
How was (and will) the feasibility funds managed and awarded? Has the strategy evolved over the award?
Happy to share with network [ y ]
Happy to share beyond network [ y ] The feasibility funds were/are managed by the BristolBridge Manager (Spreadbury), the School of Chemistry's Account Manager (Faculty of Science Finance team) and the Management Group. The Management Group meet every 8 weeks, in addition to networking events, to discuss progress and Review Panel meetings are held to review applications and award funds to 'plus' funded projects. 
The strategy was to front load the BristolBridge project by awarding the majority of 'plus' funding in year 1 in order to maximise the outcomes/impact in year 2. 
How does the research supported so far relate to the original funding application?
Happy to share with network [ y ]
Happy to share beyond network [ y ] We have funded research across all three Research Strands that were identified in the original funding application. Strand 1 (drug discovery, assays and diagnostics) has received the most funding, so far, with seven funded projects, Strand 2 (antimicrobial materials and devices) has had three funded projects and Strand 3 (AMR surveillance) two funded projects. Some early proposals related to ideas mentioned in the original proposal; but most have arisen from new collaborations initiated through BristolBridge.

Future potential call ideas and scoping activities
Happy to share with network [ y ]
Happy to share beyond network [ y ] We believe the Bridging the Gaps programme is a very successful model in Bristol and in other universities. 
We are keen to see follow-on support for this interdisciplinary initiative in AMR. There is real potential for EPS to help combat this global problem. We would suggest an extension of BtG funding with highlighted activities across, and with the other research councils. 
AMR aligns exceptionally well with EPSRC strategies in the Health Technologies Grand Challenges and the Healthy Nation outcome and there is potential here for strategically important areas for EPSRC, ranging from fundamental physical sciences, maths and engineering to technological development and translation. 
We have had three standard calls and one Global Challenge focused call to distribute institutional EPSRC funds where proposals were required to fulfil EPSRC remit and ODA compliance. We have funds remaining for a further (5th) funding round. 
Avison (Cellular and Molecular Medicine/BristolBridge) and Spreadbury (BristolBridge) attended the AHRC Town meeting on 30th November to scope opportunities in Theme 3b of the RCUK cross-council AMR initiative, &amp;quot;Understanding Real World Interactions in the Indoor and Built Environment&amp;quot;. Avison was one of four speakers, covering the topic of &amp;quot;Interdisciplinary AMR Research&amp;quot; 
BristolBridge is applying for a GW4 'Building Communities' Initiator Fund (Bristol lead, Turner) to co-fund a 'bridging the gaps' in AMR workshop with our partners in the GW4 consortium of regional universities: Bath (lead Kasprzyk-Hordern); Cardiff (lead Walsh) and Exeter (lead Gaze). Deadline 9th December. 
We are scoping opportunities in the MRC/RCUK/Newton Fund particularly with our colleague Helen Lambert (ESRC AMR Champion, based in the School of Social and Community Medicine). 
Spencer and Avison have been invited to join the BBSRC Pool of Experts and Mulholland has been invited by the MRC to join AMR Working Group for Phase 2 of cross-council AMR funding.

Happy to share with network [ y ]
Happy to share beyond network [ y ] Spreadbury is an associate member of the Research Development team in Research and Enterprise Development, and routinely highlights strategic opportunities to the BristolBridge management group and the wider Bristol AMR network. These are promoted across our network through direct emails and via the BristolBridge Newsletter (circulation 213), website and Twitter. She also promotes the other Bridging the Gaps AMR network activities as appropriate. 
Strategic opportunities highlighted include the Longitude Prize, JPIAMR 3rd and 4th calls (one PI applied), AMR cross-council ESRC-led Theme 4 (three applications submitted with Bristol Co-Is), EPSRC GCRF funding awarded to the University of Bristol (one of our PIs was successful, Barbour). AMR cross-council AHRC-led Theme 3b call (Avison and Spreadbury attended Town Meeting to gain further insights/intelligence on the call).
We have also highlighted the recent Dept. Health/Innovate UK Equipment call to build capacity in AMR. An application has been submitted by Avison (Cellular and Molecular Medicine/BristolBridge) with MacGowan (North Bristol NHS Trust). 
We were disappointed that Bridging the Gaps funded projects were excluded from applying to the EPSRC &amp;quot;Healthcare Impact Partnerships&amp;quot; call particularly since AMR Theme 2 was one of the strategic themes of the call. Both 'plus' funded Barbour (Oral and Dental Sciences/BristolBridge) and Antognozzi (Physics) would have been in a position to apply. 
Turner submitted an EoI for a Fellowship application to EPSRC &amp;quot;Healthcare Technologies Grand Challenges&amp;quot; on &amp;quot;Personalised treatment of infections in community settings to control AMR&amp;quot; and will submit full application in January 2017. 
The EPSRC &amp;quot;New Approaches to Data Science&amp;quot; call has been highlighted to investigators working in our AMR surveillance research strand (Research Strand 3) and One Health (Turner, Homer, Reyher, Bullock, Dowsey and Avison) and we are planning a meeting with the University's newest Research Institute - the Jean Golding Institute for Data Science on the role of data science in tackling AMR. 
We have also canvassed our 'plus' funded PIs and the strategic EPSRC opportunities they have identified for their 'plus' funded projects are predominantly 'Developing Future Therapies' and 'Optimising Treatments' in the Healthcare Technologies Grand Challenge ambitions but all of the Challenge ambitions were represented over our 12 pump-priming projects. In terms of the EPSRC Healthy Nations outcome, our 'plus' funded projects encompass all outcomes (H1-H5). 
What opportunities have arisen as a result of this award that would otherwise not been possible or much harder to achieve?

Happy to share with network [ y ]
Happy to share beyond network [ y ] This award with its embedded ability to fund networking events, fund pump-priming projects and the salary support for a dedicated Manager to help design and facilitate all BristolBridge activities has meant that BristolBridge has been very successful in achieving its aim to nucleate, stimulate and develop interdisciplinary projects across the University of Bristol and beyond (including bringing in collaborators in LMICs using follow-on funding). We have been able to respond flexibly and act quickly to fund potentially transformative ideas emerging from networking events. 
The BristolBridge award has brought physical scientists, engineers, mathematicians and computer scientists into the AMR arena, and as a result, is applying or developing, new techniques, tools and assays to help tackle AMR on multiple fronts. These projects would have been very difficult to fund elsewhere. 
Additionally, as all the EPS members of the BristolBridge management team are now actively working in the AMR arena, other funding opportunities have since arisen for which they are applying to help tackle AMR problems which they may have not considered before their involvement with BristolBridge.

BristolBridge has achieved many of its core aims already with the funds awarded and represents excellent value for money for the extent and breadth of interdisciplinary research it has initiated across Bristol. The funding for a full-time Manager and Research Facilitator has been integral to the success of Bristol's bridging the gaps project in year 1. Spreadbury has designed and organised very effective networking events which have generated a lot of interest, and goodwill, from both the EPS and biomedical communities. She independently and successfully manages relationships both within and beyond the network, particularly in relation to creating opportunities for realising impact (e.g. with Colin Cooper at the KCMC, Susie Williams at the EEN SW, Sara Kenney at Surgeon X/Wowbagger productions and new contacts in Thailand regarding liaison for our 'Bristol Tackling Global Challenges' week). She is an associate member of the Research Development (RD) Team in Research and Enterprise Development (RED) and attends their bi-monthly team meetings. This has enabled her to receive intelligence on RCUK's and other funding opportunities and benefit from wider issues discussed surrounding research development/follow-on funding. Her close links with the RD team means that the Faculty Research Development Managers and Institute Managers in all six Faculties and the four University Research Institutes (EBI, Cabot, Brigstowe and Jean Golding), respectively, are regularly apprised of BristolBridge's activities and funding calls and this helps to inform a campus-wide audience. She has also engaged members of the RD team to attend BristolBridge events which has been helpful in raising awareness of wider AMR funding opportunities. The BristolBridge project has expanded into related areas of AMR research and Spreadbury works closely with other players to facilitate further networking/potential funding opportunities - e.g. helping to engage the BristolBridge network with the ESRC AMR Champion's (Lambert) joint and reciprocal Bristol-Aarhus University workshop on interdisciplinary AMR working. BristolBridge initiated &amp;quot;Bristol Tackling Global Challenges&amp;quot; on receipt of its EPSRC Institutional Sponsorship funding for a joint Bristol-Thailand AMR workshop and Spreadbury is currently working with the BrisSynBio Manager, Sedgley, to expand this to incorporate a week of related BrisSynBio workshops funded via the BBSRC GCRF on Natural Product Discovery in SE Asia (Project Co-lead Mulholland) and Vaccine Development (Project Co-lead Turner). 
The BristolBridge management group members and 'plus' funded PIs have attended other Bridging the Gaps AMR network activities. Mulholland and Spreadbury attended the NAMRA/NAMRIP meeting in Southampton on 25/08/15. Su (Oral and Dental Sciences) gave an invited talk on &amp;quot;Bioinspired antimicrobial surfaces for medical implants&amp;quot; at the SHAMROK workshop on Antimicrobial Surfaces in Sheffield on 06/04/16; Seddon and Spreadbury attended the Annual AMR Networks meeting at Sheffield on 02/09/16; Barbour (Oral and Dental Sciences) attended the Antimicrobial Research Collaborative (ARC) Conference at Imperial College on 22/09/16 and Reyher (Veterinary Sciences) gave an invited presentation on &amp;quot;How can auditing supply chains address the responsible use of antibiotics&amp;quot; at the NAMRIP and Food Standards Agency (FSA) meeting on 'Food retailers, supply chains and the antimicrobial resistance challenge' in London on 25/11/16. 
Finally, the BristolBridge PI (Mulholland) and Co-Is (Avison, Spencer, Seddon, Barbour, Hauert, Turner, Homer and Tavar&amp;eacute;) also have their own AMR and AMR-related research activities, which while not directly supported by BristolBridge 'plus' funding activities, have benefited from additional collaboration through BristolBridge, involving new investigators which help to inform BristolBridge and its wider activities within the University.

Activity Inaugural BristolBridge Conference held at Engineers House, Bristol on &amp;quot;Meeting the Challenge of Antimicrobial Resistance through the Advances in the Engineering and Physical Sciences&amp;quot;
1st most expensive
2nd most influential 
Date 08/04/16
Aim To showcase the first pump-priming projects we had funded and also to demonstrate how physical sciences and engineering technologies, techniques and tools could be applied to tackling AMR. Physicists, engineers, mathematicians, modellers and bioinformaticians were invited to give presentations along with clinicians and industry. Posters and flash presentations by postdocs and PhD students were also invited. 
Target Audience University of Bristol academics, postdoctoral researchers, PhD students, industry, NHS Trusts, other Bridging the Gaps network projects. 
Key Performance Indicators (KPI)
(i.e. number of people attending, audience type, number of institutions/disciplines represented, outputs (new collaborations, applications for 'plus' funds)) 107 people attended. 
Audience: Faculty Deans, academics, postdocs, PhD students, clinicians, vets, dental scientists, industry, research council (EPSRC), Research Development and Research Commercialisation Managers.
11 institutions: University of Bristol, University of the West of England (UWE), University of Bath, Aston University (AMR4AMR), Imperial College (EMBRACE), University of Liverpool, EPSRC (Dr Jane Nicholson), Selcia Ltd (Dr Vicky Steadman, Director of Drug Discovery), Institute of Bio-Sensing Technology, Healing Children's Burns Research Centre (based at the Bristol Children's Hospital), Public Health England National Mycology Reference Laboratory. 
Disciplines: Physics, Mechanical Engineering, Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Chemistry, Engineering Maths, Computer Science, Earth Sciences, Biochemistry, Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Social and Community Medicine, Veterinary Sciences, Oral and Dental Sciences
Outputs: New collaborations resulting in three applications for 'plus' funded projects (proposals by PIs Miles (Physics) and Seddon (Physics/BristolBridge) were subsequently funded) and preliminary studies resulting in offered PhD project with the GW4 Biomed MRC DTP (Curnow, Hendry, Race, Spencer, Avison and Willis). 
Relationship to 'pathway to impact' statement A conference was part of our planning as detailed in the Case and meets the following goals in our pathways to impact: 
Breaking down barriers to collaboration 
Engagement with clinical stakeholders
Increasing interaction with industry 
Successes Spreadbury and Spencer worked up their idea, facilitated by Seddon, Turner and Homer, to involve and engage Bristol's physical scientists and engineers (none of those invited had 'plus' funding at that stage) to give presentations on their technologies which may have potential application in helping to tackle AMR. This was instrumental in showcasing Bristol's EPS community and bringing them directly into contact with their biomedical counterparts. 
The team successfully worked together to shape the programme. For the external and keynote presentations, Spreadbury invited Dr Andrew Dowsey (then University of Liverpool but due to take up a Chair at Bristol in July 2016) to present his data science approach to 'One Health'. He is now collaborating widely with Turner, Reyher (Veterinary Sciences) and Avison on AMR surveillance and diagnostics. Spencer successfully engaged the Director of Drug Discovery at Selcia Ltd (Dr Vicky Steadman), Barbour engaged Dr Amber Young from the Healing Foundation Children's Burns Research Centre, University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, Turner engaged Prof. Ed Feil (Bath) and Seddon suggested Gallagher (Dean of Science/Chemistry) to close the meeting and his participation was secured by Mulholland. 
The conference resulted in new collaborations being made which generated 3 applications for 'plus' funding and the award of 2 pump-priming projects for Miles (Physics) with Borman (National Mycology Reference Lab) and Seddon (Physics/BristolBridge), Hughes (Mech. Eng) and Spencer (Cellular and Molecular Medicine/BristolBridge). 
Seddon, Hughes and Spencer's 'plus' funded project has been extended by one month; they have also expanded the remit of their work to bring in Turner (Vet Sciences/Social and Community Medicine/BristolBridge) and Gibson (Biological Sciences) and attracted further funding via EPSRC Institutional Sponsorship 2016 support which also supports collaborative links with Thailand and Kenya and funding for collaborative visits. 
Hendry (Earth Sciences) was introduced to Spencer and Avison (both Cellular and Molecular Medicine/BristolBridge) which led to meetings, preliminary studies and an offered PhD project on &amp;quot;New antimicrobials from deep sea sponges&amp;quot; with the GW4 Biomed MRC DTP.

Challenges No major challenges
Summary
 A very successful first conference with a wide range of attendees from the University and other institutions. The enthusiastic input from the researchers presenting the results from the first pump-priming projects, PhD students and postdocs (giving 'flash' 3 minute oral presentations and posters) lent another exciting dimension. 
Feedback: &amp;quot;The BristolBridge team has fostered a really good community of interesting, interested, proactive and collegiate researchers, and you are to be highly commended for it!&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;It was a pleasure and a privilege to talk at such a fascinating and high quality meeting. I very much enjoyed it and was amazed by some of the science taking place&amp;quot;.
&amp;quot;The day was extremely enjoyable. It was a pleasure to hear of the breadth and depth of the research and also to have the chance to talk to the presenters and other University of Bristol academics. In particular, I greatly enjoyed talking to people from such a wide interdisciplinary collection of topics in a relaxed atmosphere&amp;quot;.

Activity Cross-strand World Caf&amp;eacute; at Bristol Zoo Gardens
2nd most expensive
1st most influential
Date 19/01/16
Aim 1. To set out the challenge of AMR from the perspective of healthcare professionals in primary care, secondary care and veterinary medicine in farming and livestock production for investigators outside the field to understand what problems need to be addressed. 
2. Facilitated World Caf&amp;eacute; session to brainstorm questions relating to specific challenges/problems followed by reporting discussion outcome to the room.
3. Expert panel discussion (clinical &amp;amp; EPS panellists) - audience told that &amp;quot;no question is too stupid to ask&amp;quot; 
4. Small group working to start developing interdisciplinary pump-priming projects and short project pitches 
Target Audience Cross-Faculty University of Bristol academics particularly those working in engineering, mathematical and physical sciences, microbiology/infectious diseases, clinicians, vets, dental scientists, clinical microbiologists working in NHS hospital pathology laboratories. 
Key Performance Indicators (KPI)
(i.e. number of people attending, audience type, number of institutions/disciplines represented, outputs (new collaborations, applications for 'plus' funds)) 75 people attended 
Audience: Academic staff from 4 of the 6 University of Bristol Faculties (Biomedical Sciences, Health Sciences, Science and Engineering), postdoctoral research staff, clinicians, vets, dental scientists, clinical microbiologists from Public Health England pathology labs, Research Development Managers and other Project Managers (e.g. from the Centre of Academic Primary Care). 
5 Institutions: University of Bristol, University of Swansea, Public Health England, North Bristol NHS Trust (Southmead Hospital) and University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust (Bristol Royal Infirmary) 
Disciplines: Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, Engineering Mathematics, Computer Science, Complexity Sciences, Mechanical Engineering, Biochemistry, Biological Sciences, Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Veterinary Sciences, Oral and Dental Sciences and Social and Community Medicine. 
Outputs: New collaborative proposals, for example from: 
Hill, Crosby, Perriman, Turner, Williams and colleagues
Picco, Payton and Leeming 
Bullock, Reyher, Brooks-Pollock, Tasker and Danon

12 applications for 'plus' funding 
Barbour, Barrett, Spencer and Tisdall now have a joint iCASE PhD project 
Relationship to 'pathway to impact' statement A World Caf&amp;eacute; event was part of our planning as detailed in the Case and meets the following goals in our pathways to impact: 
Breaking down barriers to collaboration
Engagement with clinical stakeholders
Successes An atmosphere buzzing with enthusiasm and a commitment to tackle AMR. Holding the event away from the University meant that people were focused on the aims of the event and stayed the whole day. The surroundings and catering at Bristol Zoo Gardens also contributed to the success of the event and the feeling of both goodwill and a valuable day spent away from the office/lab. Many academics commented on how liberating it was to spend a whole day discussing research. 
Spreadbury initiated and secured the participation of Prof. Alastair Hay, a practising GP and Professor of Primary Care (Social and Community Medicine) and Prof. David Barrett Professor of Bovine Medicine, Reproduction and Production (Veterinary Sciences). Spencer secured Prof Alasdair MacGowan, Professor of Antimicrobial Therapeutics, North Bristol NHS Trust. Spreadbury worked with them all to ensure they understood that their particular role was to highlight the challenges of AMR from their clinical/veterinary perspectives in a way that a diverse audience of different expertises could understand. They all gave superb keynote clinical presentations and participated in all the day's activities. 
6 projects were informally pitched and new collaborations were initiated. Some went on to develop applications for 'plus' funds - 12 applications received in funding round 2. 
55% increase in submitted applications compared to the first funding round.
For more details on this event, please see: 
http://www.bristol.ac.uk/bristolbridge/news/2016/cross-strand-amr-world-cafe.html
Challenges The short amount of time to pinpoint the key areas which needed to be discussed after challenges were set out in the clinical and veterinary keynote presentations 
Summary
 The World Caf&amp;eacute; was viewed, and is still viewed, as a very successful event which employed a format for the day which was both highly engaging and productive. The official launch was inspiring but the World Caf&amp;eacute; embedded the view by Bristol investigators that BristolBridge events were worth attending. Subsequently, the conference was very well attended too and smaller workshops and training events have been similarly well patronised. 
We heard that the event was much discussed with people who could not/did not attend and it was also flagged at a School Research Committee meeting as being a highly successful event. 
It was satisfying to see that many attendees had ideas for projects they wanted to discuss with potential new collaborators they had met during the day and self-organised groups quickly fell into place. During small group working, ideas for projects emerged very quickly and six exciting project proposals were pitched by the end of the afternoon
Feedback: A facilitator commented that &amp;quot;There seemed to be a tremendous amount of energy and enthusiasm for collaborating and making exciting things happen&amp;quot;. 
Turner (Veterinary Sciences/BristolBridge) reported &amp;quot;Lots of people said afterwards how collaborative and willing people were to go a bit outside their comfort zones and ask stupid/obvious questions. So easy to forget we don't all know about atomic force microscopy and synovial fluid. I heard lots of questions asked that would have been difficult or impossible in another context - if that's not bridging the gaps I don't know what is&amp;quot;.

Activity BristolBridge Official Launch
4th most expensive
3rd most influential
Date 11/11/15
Aim To officially launch the BristolBridge project to the University of Bristol. A 'call to arms' to encourage investigators in the physical sciences, mathematics and engineering disciplines to engage with their counterparts in the life sciences, human and veterinary medicine to tackle the problem of AMR. The idea for a launch came from Avison who sensed that interest may have waned since the brainstorming sessions held in the summer and the time taken to appoint the Manager and Research Facilitator (Spreadbury) who took up her post in October. 
Target Audience University of Bristol and Bristol NHS Trusts 
Key Performance Indicators (KPI)
(i.e. number of people attending, audience type, number of institutions/disciplines represented, outputs (new collaborations, applications for 'plus' funds)) 130 people attended
Audience: The Vice Chancellor, Prof. Hugh Brady; the Pro Vice Chancellor (Research) Prof. Nishan Canagarajah, the Deans and (some) Faculty Research Directors of the Faculties of Engineering, Science, Biomedical Sciences and Health Sciences, academics, postdoctoral researchers, PhD students including from the BCFN and ACCIS Centres for Doctoral Training, Heads of School, Research and Enterprise Development, Finance staff involved in the original application
3 Institutions: University of Bristol, North Bristol NHS Trust and University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust 

Disciplines: Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, Engineering Maths, Mechanical Engineering, Aerospace Engineering, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Civil Engineering, Computer Science, Complexity Sciences, Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Biochemistry, Biological Sciences, Veterinary Sciences, Oral and Dental Sciences, Social and Community Medicine 
Outputs: The excellent and engaging talks by Brady, Tavar&amp;eacute;, Avison, Mulholland and Lambert, the excellent vibe and good humoured atmosphere - and complimentary wine and food - generated a lot of goodwill and laid the foundation for investigators to be interested in attending future BristolBridge events and undertake interdisciplinary working.
Relationship to 'pathway to impact' statement An official launch event was not part of our planning as detailed in the Case but clearly an excellent format to attract diverse expertise and galvanise interdisciplinary collaboration. The launch meets the following goals in our pathways to impact: 
Breaking down barriers to collaboration 
Engagement with cinical stakeholders
Successes Spreadbury engaging the new Vice Chancellor to preside over the launch. The successful design and organisation (at fairly short notice) of the launch event by Spreadbury and its promotion by Spreadbury and Mulholland, in particular, to ensure an excellent turnout and a large number of poster presentations. Thought provoking and engaging presentations in which Brady gave a thoughtful opening address reflecting on his clinical experience and frustration at seeing his former renal patients die of infection and how opportune BristolBridge was in tackling the the problem of AMR. Tavar&amp;eacute; (Elizabeth BIackwell Institute/BristolBridge) praised the highly collaborative and collegiate research environment at Bristol which would help to engender the interdisciplinary research needed to ensure BristolBridge's mission to bridge the gaps between the EPS and biomedical communities. Mulholland (Chemistry/BristolBridge) poignantly reminded the audience that the launch was being held on Remembrance Day and that World War II was the dawn of the antibiotic era; an era which heralded modern medicine, and now, just 80 years later, has left us facing an antibiotic apocalypse. Avison (Cellular and Molecular Medicine/BristolBridge) outlined the challenge of the problem, the need to understand transmission of AMR in the environment and the role we can all play in reducing antibiotic overuse and stewardship of the antibiotics we have. He also showcased the wider AMR research already taking place at the University of Bristol in tackling this. Lambert - the ESRC National AMR Champion (Social and Community Medicine) highlighted the importance of social science in helping to tackle AMR in an interdisciplinary manner. Mulholland concluded by launching the second funding round. For more details on this event, please see:
http://www.bristol.ac.uk/bristolbridge/news/2015/official-launch.html
Challenges No major challenges but a lot of energy and commitment required from Spreadbury and Mulholland, in particular, to ensure as wide participation as possible. 
Summary
 A vibrant event which got everyone talking about the challenge of AMR and enthusiastic about tackling the problem in interdisciplinary ways. Tavar&amp;eacute; (Elizabeth Blackwell Institute/BristolBridge) challenged everyone to discuss at least one idea for tackling the problem of AMR with another attendee during the wine and cheese reception which followed the presentations. The event helped to publicise BristolBridge and its aims and also generated a lot of goodwill for future networking events and appetite for applying for 'plus' funding. The design and format of the launch was pivotal in generating a very positive, high energy atmosphere with lots of opportunity for extensive networking (pre-event welcome drinks and poster presentations too).

Activity Visit by RedX Pharma 
4th most expensive 
4th most influential? Hard to judge but arguably the most influential in terms of impact re. industrial engagement 
Date 11-12th May 2016
Aim To follow up on a visit initiated by Colin Cooper (KCMC Manager/School of Chemistry) and made by both Cooper and Mulholland (Chemistry/BristolBridge) in February 2016. RedX were interested in collaborating to help them overcome some problems with an antimicrobial compound they were trying to repurpose from Gram-positive to broader activity. They were also interested in engaging help from our Chemistry colleagues to help overcome a formulation problem with a lead compound. 
Following the execution of a mutual confidentiality agreement between the University of Bristol and RedX Pharma (facilitated by Cooper and Spreadbury), we invited three of them to spend two days in Bristol to discuss mutually beneficial research. 
Target Audience Two part visit: Dinner with RedX delegates attended by Gallagher (Dean of Science/School of Chemistry), Cooper (KCMC/Chemistry), Mulholland (Chemistry/BristolBridge), Spencer, Avison (both Cellular and Molecular Medicine/BristolBridge) and Spreadbury (BristolBridge)
Day 2 workshop: PIs and Co-Is from 'plus' funded projects, particularly relating to microbiology and drug discovery, at the University of Bristol were invited and PIs from the School of Chemistry were invited who would be able to advise and collaborate. 
RedX Pharma's Business Development and Alliance Manager, Dr Kate Lower, gave an introductory presentation about RedX Pharma's portfolio of research for drug discovery and two scientists gave presentations outlining the problems they required collaborative help with. 
The RedX visitors toured the School of Chemistry research facilities and had one-to-one meetings with several academics. 
We also invited Bailey and Lazarus (Biological Sciences and Co-Is on 'plus' funded BristolBridge project) and PI and Co-I, respectively, on AMR cross-council Theme 2 funded consortium award on &amp;quot;Exploring Natures Silent Pharmacy&amp;quot; to give a presentation on their work for a systems-based platform for the production of novel antibiotics. 
Key Performance Indicators (KPI)
(i.e. number of people attending, audience type, number of institutions/disciplines represented, outputs (new collaborations, applications for 'plus' funds)) 15 people attended the workshop
Audience: Senior academics (PI/Co-I) from the Schools of Chemistry, Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Biochemistry and Biological Sciences. 
Disciplines: Microbiology, drug discovery investigators, chemists including experts in NMR, computational chemistry, materials chemistry, organic chemistry (molecular conformation), synthetic and biological chemistry 
Outputs: New collaborations and funding as Carmen Galan (Chemistry), Spencer (Cellular and Molecular Medicine/BristolBridge) and Cooper (KCMC/Chemistry) went on to successfully apply for an EPSRC Institutional Sponsorship 2016 funded project. 
Relationship to 'pathway to impact' statement Stimulating interactions with industry was planned in our Case and this event meets the following goals in our pathways to impact: 
Increasing interaction with industry
Successes An example of proactive and professional industrial engagement initiated by Cooper (KCMC/Chemistry and facilitated by Cooper, Mulholland and Spreadbury for the benefit of BristolBridge and other investigators based in the School of Chemistry. 
Chemists led by Craig Butts (Chemistry) undertook contract research to solve a significant problem with a lead compound. 
Galan (Chemistry), Spencer (Cellular and Molecular Medicine/BristolBridge) and Cooper (KCMC/Chemistry) went on to successfully apply for an EPSRC Institutional Sponsorship 2016 funded project. 
Challenges The only challenge was finding a date when all the most important stakeholders could attend. 
Summary
 A productive and mutually beneficial visit by RedX Pharma resulting in a funded collaborative project and an impact already generated by our colleagues in the School of Chemistry who have helped to solve a problem with one of RedX Pharma's lead compounds. This industrial-academic transaction has added value and greatly enhanced our relationship with this pharmaceutical company which may potentially lead to preferred or even strategic collaborations in the future. 
Of direct relevance to AMR, was the help required by RedX from University of Bristol investigators to help repurpose an antimicrobial compound. This resulted in a successful application to EPSRC Institutional Sponsorship 2016 for Galan, Spencer and Cooper and are now successfully collaborating with RedX to try and achieve this aim.

Activity Schools Conference on Antibiotics and Antibiotic Resistance Science
5th most expensive
Influence unknown but potentially far reaching and impactful 
Date 09/11/16
Aim To educate and engage the public about antibiotics and AMR with presentations from academics and PhD students working in the field. This was organised by BristolBridge with support from the ChemLabS outreach team (Director, Tim Harrison) 
Target Audience Post 16-year old science pupils and their teachers
Key Performance Indicators (KPI)
(i.e. number of people attending, audience type, number of institutions/disciplines represented, outputs (new collaborations, applications for 'plus' funds)) 160 attended. 
Audience: Post 16-year old pupils (studying AS and A-level Biology and Chemistry) and teachers attended from 9 schools across the southwest region (Bristol, Somerset, Wiltshire and Cornwall)
Relationship to 'pathway to impact' statement This event was part of our planning as detailed in the Case to educate school age children and meets the following goals in our pathways to impact: 
Engagement with the public and education
Successes Seeing the pupils engage so ethusiastically with the demonstrations and activities and also with the PhD students who were running the demonstrations. 
Reading the comments from the pupils to see that Avison's lecture had informed them about antibiotics, AMR and how drug resistant infections occur. Excellent feedback; the teachers particularly liked the demos which ranged from a virtual reality molecular simulation of ?-lactamase to swarming robots to model bacterial biofilms. 
For more details on this event, please see: http://www.bristol.ac.uk/bristolbridge/news/schools-conference-on-antibiotics-and-antibiotic-resistance-science.html 
An article on our Schools Conference will be submitted in March 2017 to be included in the September 2017 issue of Science in School (the European Journal for science teachers http://www.scienceinschool.org/ 
Challenges Mostly organisational - a lot of facilitation and coordination required to develop ideas and the realisation of hands-on, discovery-led activities and demonstrations. 
Summary
 Presentations by Avison (Cellular and Molecular Medicine/BristolBridge) on &amp;quot;The rise and fall of antibiotics&amp;quot;. Paul Walker (Chem Synthesis CDT PhD student) gave a talk on &amp;quot;How do we make new antibiotics&amp;quot; and Catherine Tooke (BBSRC SWBio DTP PhD student) gave a talk on &amp;quot;Nerds vs. antibiotic resistance: Can we use computers to outsmart resistance?&amp;quot; (presented by Mulholland as she was unavailable on the day). The PhD students presenting talks were encouraged to inform the audience about their choices at A-level, degree etc so the pupils could understand their journey into STEM and postgraduate research. 
Hands-on, discovery led demonstrations were given by staff and postgraduates from four Faculties: 
Nano Simbox - Simulations of the Molecular Nano World (Interactive Science Ltd (iSci) and School of Chemistry)
Modelling bacteria using robot swarms (Dept. Engineering Maths &amp;amp; Bristol Robotics Lab)
How penicillin works (Schools of Cellular &amp;amp; Molecular Medicine and Chemistry) 
The bacterial evolution and medicinal chemistry &amp;quot;Arms Race&amp;quot; (School of Cellular &amp;amp; Molecular Medicine and Dept. Engineering Maths) 
Bugs under the microscope (School of Cellular &amp;amp; Molecular Medicine) 
Maths can help fight AMR too! (Dept. Engineering Maths and School of Veterinary Sciences) 
Bacteria get everywhere! How can we design materials to repel them? (Bristol Centre for Functional Materials, School of Physics) 
Game Zone - Play the Superbugs game (BristolBridge)
Antimicrobial resistance - tell us what you know (BristolBridge)
 A very successful event to engage young people which helped to change their attitudes to antibiotics and AMR e.g. &amp;quot;I'm going to wash my hands more because I don't wanna die&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;I realise now how much we need/should reduce the use of antibiotics&amp;quot;; &amp;quot; Never realised how close and urgent this whole issue is&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;Antibiotics need to be used less in farming&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;Not as hopeless as I thought. Excited by the new technology that can help!&amp;quot;
Teacher's feedback: &amp;quot;Many thanks indeed for such an enjoyable and illuminating and relevant afternoon; our girls had been looking forward to this for many weeks! Super and engaging demonstrations and it really made the curriculum come to life. We, as ever, were welcome and the sessions were especially well organised. Our girls especially relished meeting PhD students and learning about their research at the University of Bristol. The lectures were thoroughly enjoyable and enlightening; we have had our horizons broadened! All in all a superb afternoon&amp;quot;.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c71f7a52ae48.15265532</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:stage>Initial development</gtr:stage><gtr:status>Actively seeking support</gtr:status><gtr:title>BristolBridge: Bridging the Gaps between the engineering and physical sciences and AMR.</gtr:title><gtr:type>Therapeutic Intervention - Drug</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.bristol.ac.uk/bristolbridge/</gtr:url><gtr:yearDevCompleted>2017</gtr:yearDevCompleted></gtr:productOutput></gtr:productOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>HECBioSim, the UK HEC Biomolecular Simulation Consortium, was established in March 2013, and works closely with and complements CCP-BioSim (the UK Collaborative Computational Project for Biomolecular Simulation at the Life Sciences Interface). Most of the members of the Consortium are experienced users of high end computing. Biomolecular simulations are now making significant contributions to a wide variety of problems in drug design and development, biocatalysis, bio and nano-technology, chemical biology and medicine. The UK has a strong and growing community in this field, recognized by the establishment in 2011 by the EPSRC of CCP-BioSim (ccpbiosim.ac.uk), and its renewal in 2015. There is a clear, growing and demonstrable need for HEC in this field. Members of the Consortium have, for example, served on the HECToR and ARCHER Resource Allocation Panel. The Consortium welcomes members across the whole biomolecular sciences community, and we are currently (and will remain) open to new members (unlike some consortia). Since establishing the Consortium, several new members (FLG, DH, ER) have joined the Management Group. Many of the projects awarded ARCHER time under the Consortium do not involve CCP-BioSim or HECBioSim Management Group members, demonstrating the openness of HECBioSim and its support of the biomolecular simulation community in the UK. A number of other researchers have joined and it is our expectation that other researchers will join HECBioSim in the future. We actively engage with structural and chemical biologists and industrial researchers. We foster interactions between computational, experimental and industrial scientists (see the example case studies; members of the Consortium have excellent links with many pharmaceutical, chemical and biotechnology companies). Details of HECBioSim are available via our webpages at: http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk 

Applications are made through the website http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk and reviewed at one of the series of regular panel meetings. 

A list of successful HECtime allocations on ARCHER is available at:http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk/applications/successfulprojects

All proposals are of course subject to scientific and technical review, but we have the philosophy of supporting the best science to deliver the highest impact, rather than focusing on supporting development of a couple of codes. An allocation panel (with changing membership) meets twice yearly to judge proposals and requests for AUs; projects are assessed competitively: any groups in the UK can apply. All submitted proposals receive constructive feedback from the allocation panel.

The HECBioSim website also provides forums for the biomolecular simulation community, a wiki hosting useful how-tos and user guides, and software downloads (currently FESetup and Longbow). Our lead software development project between Nottingham (Charlie Laughton and Gareth Shannon) and Daresbury (James Gebbie), we have developed a remote job submission tool, 'Longbow' (see below). The tool is designed to reproduce the look and feel of local MD packages, but to stage data and submit jobs to a large HPC resource, such as ARCHER, in a manner invisible to the user. 
Workshops and New Opportunities
No more than half a page detailing upcoming workshops and meetings. Also include discussion of other areas which are potentially of interest to other HEC Consortia and opportunities for cross CCP /HEC working.

Workshops are listed below and can be found on the HECBioSim Website
We work closely with CCP-BioSim, for example in organizing training workshops and meetings. Our activities are outlined at www.hecbiosim.ac.uk Examples of forthcoming meetings include:
Computational Molecular Science 2017 - on Sunday 19 March 2017 
17th European Seminar on Computational Methods in Quantum Chemistry - on Tuesday 11 July 2017
Frontiers of Biomolecular Simulation Southampton, September 2016
Issues and Problems
Short discussion of any issues or problems that the HEC Consortium faces including issues with the ARCHER service, funding, management of allocation and staffing. This is also a good opportunity to highlight to the SLA committee any issues that the Consortium may have experienced with their SLA support during the reporting period.

Details of SLA activities are given in the SLA report. Dr. James Gebbie provides support to HECBioSIm through the SLA. He has been very helpful in the construction of the HECBioSim webpages (hecbiosim.ac.uk). James also worked with Dr. Gareth Shannon on the development of Longbow (See above). 
In the past year, members of the Consortium faced some queuing problems; close to the end of the first allocation period in particular, there were long queuing times, which led to problems in completing jobs and using allocated time. Throughput has been a real problem in the past few months.

? For the reporting period please provide a brief update on the progress of software development activities associated with the Consortium and the impact this has had on Consortium members and the broader research community.

Our lead software development project between Nottingham (Charlie Laughton and Gareth Shannon) and Daresbury (James Gebbie), we have developed a remote job submission tool, 'Longbow' (see below). The tool is designed to reproduce the look and feel of local MD packages, but to stage data and submit jobs to a large HPC resource such as ARCHER in a manner invisible to the user. An open beta version was released unrestricted to the community in March 2015 (http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk/longbow and via PyPI https://pypi.python.org ) with ~100 downloads. Functionality includes native support for biosimulation packages AMBER, CHARMM, GROMACS, LAMMPS and NAMD, native support for jobs on ARCHER, native support for jobs running on PBS and LSF schedulers, and support for three different job types (single, ensembles and multiple jobs). The software is written both as an application for users and an API for developers. CCP-EM have integrated Longbow into their developmental GUI, and shortly FESetup will ship with native support for job submission using Longbow. We are currently in talks with ClusterVision with respect to them distributing Longbow to their user base as a user friendly way for novices to interact with their systems.

Longbow
Longbow has been growing in popularity both amongst researchers within the biosimulation field and those in other fields. In this reporting period there have been five new releases of Longbow delivering a plethora of user requested features and bug fixes. Some of the key developments are summarised below:
? Implemented a Recovery mode - Should the event happen that Longbow crashes or the system in which Longbow is controlling jobs from powers down. The user can now reconnect to the crashed session and carry on as if nothing happened.
? Sub-Queuing - More and more system administrators are setting limits not just on the number of simulations that can run, but also on the number of jobs that can go into the queue. Longbow can now automatically detect this and implement its own queue feeding jobs into the system queue as slots open up.
? Dis-connectible/Re-connectible Longbow sessions - A user can now launch Longbow to fire off all jobs and then disconnect, at a later date the user can re-establish the connection and download all results (no need for persistent connections anymore) 
? Ability to include scripts in the Longbow generated submit files.
? Numerous stability, performance and bug fixes
Longbow continues to be the submission engine that is used under the hood of the CCP-EM toolkit FLEX-EM. There are several other interesting projects that are making use of Longbow. 
A project by the energy efficient computing group (Hartree Center) are currently integrating Longbow with CK, a crowd sourced compilation optimisation tool aimed at finding efficient compilation configuration. 
A project by the Applications performance engineering group (Hartree Center) are currently integrating longbow into Melody, a runtime optimisation tool aimed at optimising runtime configuration of simulations.
A project by the computational biology group (Hartree Center) an automated setup, launch and analysis platform for MD on protein-membrane simulations.

Other Highlights for the Current Reporting Period: Please provide details of any other significant highlights from the reporting period that are not captured elsewhere in the report.


Professor Adrian Mullholland organised and chaired the Computational Chemistry, Gordon Research Conference, Girona, Spain 24th - 29th July 2016.

The theme of the 2016 Computational Chemistry GRC was &amp;quot;Theory and Simulation Across Scales in Molecular Science&amp;quot;. It focused on method development and state-of-the-art applications across computational molecular science, and encouraged cross-fertilization between areas. The conference was oversubscribed, with attendees from industry and academia. The meeting received a High-Performance Rating, and was commended for the assessment that 95% of conferees rated this meeting &amp;quot;above average&amp;quot; on all evaluation areas (science, discussion, management, atmosphere and suitability).


HEC Consortia Model: Over the coming months EPSRC will be looking at the future of the HEC Consortia model and potential future funding. We would like to use this opportunity to ask the Consortia Chairs for input:
? What are the key benefits that your community have experienced through the existence of the HEC Consortia? 
? What elements of the financial support provided by the HEC Consortium's grant have worked well and what could be improved in the future? 


We aim to expand the breadth of the work of the Consortium focusing on cutting-edge applications, and building collaborations with experiments and industry, to achieve maximum impact from ARCHER use. We discussed Grand Challenges at our most recent Management Group meeting. In December 2015, and have identified several to follow up as strategic priorities. We aim to tackle and support large-scale grand challenge applications in biomolecular science, in areas such as antimicrobial resistance, membrane dynamics, drug design and synthetic biology. One specific theme with potentially high impact in drug discovery is large -scale comparative investigation of allosteric regulation in different superfamilies of proteins (e.g. PAS domain containing proteins, tyrosine kinases, etc.). The major impact will be in the identification of novel selective therapeutic molecules with limited adverse side effects. As a Consortium, we intend to develop and apply novel computational approaches for the rational design of allosteric regulators of hitherto 'undruggable' targets. Many of the targets emerging from large-scale genetic screening are deemed undruggable due to the difficulty of designing drug-like modulators that bind to their catalytic sites. It is increasingly clear that these targets might be effectively targeted by designing drugs that bind to protein-protein interfaces and allosteric sites. To do that, however, new rational design strategies, based on an in-depth knowledge of protein dynamics and advanced modelling and new simulation techniques are required. Other challenging frontier areas include dynamics of motor proteins; prediction of the effects of pathogenic mutations on protein function. The accurate prediction of free energy of binding is still in its infancy and needs much further investigation. Finally, kinetics of biomolecular reactions will become the next big topic. It is clear that high end computing resource can provide the necessary power and capability to provide inroads into this vital area. This is important because it is becoming increasingly apparent that kinetics of drug binding is a key factor that the pharmaceutical sector should really be looking at in terms of a major dictator of potency.

HECBioSim is now well established, supporting work of many groups across the UK in the growing field of biomolecular simulation. We benefit from an Advisory Group containing members from industry, as we as international biomolecular simulation experts and experimental scientists. The Advisory Board was expanded and refreshed for the renewal and consists of: Dr. Nicolas Foloppe (Vernalis plc, Chair); Dr. Colin Edge (GlaxoSmithKline); Dr. Mike King (UCB Pharmaceuticals); Dr. Mike Mazanetz (Evotec AG); Dr. Garrett Morris (Crysalin Ltd.); Dr. Gary Tresadern (Johnson and Johnson Pharmaceuticals); Dr. Richard Ward (AstraZeneca); Prof. Modesto Orozco (IRB, Barcelona); Prof. Tony Watts, (Oxford, NMR); Dr. Pete Bond (A*STAR Bioinformatics Institute Singapore). We aim to foster industrial collaborations and collaborations with experimentalists (e.g. joint workshops with CCPN, Institute of Physics (Sarah Harris, Leeds Physics); see e.g. case studies. A particular theme for strategic development will be multiscale modelling, building on collaborations between several groups in the Consortium and the other CCPs. This theme reflects the inclusive and forward looking philosophy of HecBioSim, which is a community open to new ideas, keen to develop new methods, and ultimately to use HEC to drive exciting new science.

The Consortium model allows new collaborations to develop. The recent reduction in time allocated to HECBioSim has meant that we can support fewer projects. There is significantly more demand for computer time than we can accommodate through our current allocation. We intend to work with Tier 2 Centres to explore possibilities for applications, and e.g. to test emerging architectures for biomolecular simulation. 

Edina Rosta (Computational Chemistry, Kings College London) comments: &amp;quot;HECBioSim enables my group to perform biomolecular simulations at the high standards required for JACS, Angewandte, etc. Without this consortium I would not be able to perform the necessary calculations leading to publishable work in top journals as our local university resources are limited and the hpc systems are not well maintained&amp;quot;.

Regarding financial support: the administrative support provided via the consortium grant is essential to the functioning of HECBioSim. This role is currently undertaken by Simone Breckell who not only administers, allocates time to projects and arranges panel meetings but has also done a fantastic job collating the extensive information for this EPSRC report.</gtr:description><gtr:id>E541FC3B-9978-4F26-9EBB-F4F848463E23</gtr:id><gtr:impact>HECBioSim, the UK HEC Biomolecular Simulation Consortium, was established in March 2013, and works closely with and complements CCP-BioSim (the UK Collaborative Computational Project for Biomolecular Simulation at the Life Sciences Interface). Most of the members of the Consortium are experienced users of high end computing. Biomolecular simulations are now making significant contributions to a wide variety of problems in drug design and development, biocatalysis, bio and nano-technology, chemical biology and medicine. The UK has a strong and growing community in this field, recognized by the establishment in 2011 by the EPSRC of CCP-BioSim (ccpbiosim.ac.uk), and its renewal in 2015. There is a clear, growing and demonstrable need for HEC in this field. Members of the Consortium have, for example, served on the HECToR and ARCHER Resource Allocation Panel. The Consortium welcomes members across the whole biomolecular sciences community, and we are currently (and will remain) open to new members (unlike some consortia). Since establishing the Consortium, several new members (FLG, DH, ER) have joined the Management Group. Many of the projects awarded ARCHER time under the Consortium do not involve CCP-BioSim or HECBioSim Management Group members, demonstrating the openness of HECBioSim and its support of the biomolecular simulation community in the UK. A number of other researchers have joined and it is our expectation that other researchers will join HECBioSim in the future. We actively engage with structural and chemical biologists and industrial researchers. We foster interactions between computational, experimental and industrial scientists (see the example case studies; members of the Consortium have excellent links with many pharmaceutical, chemical and biotechnology companies). Details of HECBioSim are available via our webpages at: http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk 

Applications are made through the website http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk and reviewed at one of the series of regular panel meetings. 

A list of successful HECtime allocations on ARCHER is available at:http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk/applications/successfulprojects

All proposals are of course subject to scientific and technical review, but we have the philosophy of supporting the best science to deliver the highest impact, rather than focusing on supporting development of a couple of codes. An allocation panel (with changing membership) meets twice yearly to judge proposals and requests for AUs; projects are assessed competitively: any groups in the UK can apply. All submitted proposals receive constructive feedback from the allocation panel.

The HECBioSim website also provides forums for the biomolecular simulation community, a wiki hosting useful how-tos and user guides, and software downloads (currently FESetup and Longbow). Our lead software development project between Nottingham (Charlie Laughton and Gareth Shannon) and Daresbury (James Gebbie), we have developed a remote job submission tool, 'Longbow' (see below). The tool is designed to reproduce the look and feel of local MD packages, but to stage data and submit jobs to a large HPC resource, such as ARCHER, in a manner invisible to the user. 
Workshops and New Opportunities
No more than half a page detailing upcoming workshops and meetings. Also include discussion of other areas which are potentially of interest to other HEC Consortia and opportunities for cross CCP /HEC working.

Workshops are listed below and can be found on the HECBioSim Website
We work closely with CCP-BioSim, for example in organizing training workshops and meetings. Our activities are outlined at www.hecbiosim.ac.uk Examples of forthcoming meetings include:

17th European Seminar on Computational Methods in Quantum Chemistry - on Tuesday 11 July 2017
Frontiers of Biomolecular Simulation Southampton, September 2016
Issues and Problems
Short discussion of any issues or problems that the HEC Consortium faces including issues with the ARCHER service, funding, management of allocation and staffing. This is also a good opportunity to highlight to the SLA committee any issues that the Consortium may have experienced with their SLA support during the reporting period.

Details of SLA activities are given in the SLA report. Dr. James Gebbie provides support to HECBioSIm through the SLA. He has been very helpful in the construction of the HECBioSim webpages (hecbiosim.ac.uk). James also worked with Dr. Gareth Shannon on the development of Longbow (See above). 
In the past year, members of the Consortium faced some queuing problems; close to the end of the first allocation period in particular, there were long queuing times, which led to problems in completing jobs and using allocated time. Throughput has been a real problem in the past few months.

? For the reporting period please provide a brief update on the progress of software development activities associated with the Consortium and the impact this has had on Consortium members and the broader research community.

Our lead software development project between Nottingham (Charlie Laughton and Gareth Shannon) and Daresbury (James Gebbie), we have developed a remote job submission tool, 'Longbow' (see below). The tool is designed to reproduce the look and feel of local MD packages, but to stage data and submit jobs to a large HPC resource such as ARCHER in a manner invisible to the user. An open beta version was released unrestricted to the community in March 2015 (http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk/longbow and via PyPI https://pypi.python.org ) with ~100 downloads. Functionality includes native support for biosimulation packages AMBER, CHARMM, GROMACS, LAMMPS and NAMD, native support for jobs on ARCHER, native support for jobs running on PBS and LSF schedulers, and support for three different job types (single, ensembles and multiple jobs). The software is written both as an application for users and an API for developers. CCP-EM have integrated Longbow into their developmental GUI, and shortly FESetup will ship with native support for job submission using Longbow. We are currently in talks with ClusterVision with respect to them distributing Longbow to their user base as a user friendly way for novices to interact with their systems.

Longbow
Longbow has been growing in popularity both amongst researchers within the biosimulation field and those in other fields. In this reporting period there have been five new releases of Longbow delivering a plethora of user requested features and bug fixes. Some of the key developments are summarised below:
? Implemented a Recovery mode - Should the event happen that Longbow crashes or the system in which Longbow is controlling jobs from powers down. The user can now reconnect to the crashed session and carry on as if nothing happened.
? Sub-Queuing - More and more system administrators are setting limits not just on the number of simulations that can run, but also on the number of jobs that can go into the queue. Longbow can now automatically detect this and implement its own queue feeding jobs into the system queue as slots open up.
? Dis-connectible/Re-connectible Longbow sessions - A user can now launch Longbow to fire off all jobs and then disconnect, at a later date the user can re-establish the connection and download all results (no need for persistent connections anymore) 
? Ability to include scripts in the Longbow generated submit files.
? Numerous stability, performance and bug fixes
Longbow continues to be the submission engine that is used under the hood of the CCP-EM toolkit FLEX-EM. There are several other interesting projects that are making use of Longbow. 
A project by the energy efficient computing group (Hartree Center) are currently integrating Longbow with CK, a crowd sourced compilation optimisation tool aimed at finding efficient compilation configuration. 
A project by the Applications performance engineering group (Hartree Center) are currently integrating longbow into Melody, a runtime optimisation tool aimed at optimising runtime configuration of simulations.

Other Highlights for the Current Reporting Period: Please provide details of any other significant highlights from the reporting period that are not captured elsewhere in the report.


Professor Adrian Mullholland organised and chaired the Computational Chemistry, Gordon Research Conference, Girona, Spain 24th - 29th July 2016.

The theme of the 2016 Computational Chemistry GRC was &amp;quot;Theory and Simulation Across Scales in Molecular Science&amp;quot;. It focused on method development and state-of-the-art applications across computational molecular science, and encouraged cross-fertilization between areas. The conference was oversubscribed, with attendees from industry and academia. The meeting received a High-Performance Rating, and was commended for the assessment that 95% of conferees rated this meeting &amp;quot;above average&amp;quot; on all evaluation areas (science, discussion, management, atmosphere and suitability).


HEC Consortia Model: Over the coming months EPSRC will be looking at the future of the HEC Consortia model and potential future funding. We would like to use this opportunity to ask the Consortia Chairs for input:
? What are the key benefits that your community have experienced through the existence of the HEC Consortia? 
? What elements of the financial support provided by the HEC Consortium's grant have worked well and what could be improved in the future? 


We aim to expand the breadth of the work of the Consortium focusing on cutting-edge applications, and building collaborations with experiments and industry, to achieve maximum impact from ARCHER use. We discussed Grand Challenges at our most recent Management Group meeting. In December 2015, and have identified several to follow up as strategic priorities. We aim to tackle and support large-scale grand challenge applications in biomolecular science, in areas such as antimicrobial resistance, membrane dynamics, drug design and synthetic biology. One specific theme with potentially high impact in drug discovery is large -scale comparative investigation of allosteric regulation in different superfamilies of proteins (e.g. PAS domain containing proteins, tyrosine kinases, etc.). The major impact will be in the identification of novel selective therapeutic molecules with limited adverse side effects. As a Consortium, we intend to develop and apply novel computational approaches for the rational design of allosteric regulators of hitherto 'undruggable' targets. Many of the targets emerging from large-scale genetic screening are deemed undruggable due to the difficulty of designing drug-like modulators that bind to their catalytic sites. It is increasingly clear that these targets might be effectively targeted by designing drugs that bind to protein-protein interfaces and allosteric sites. To do that, however, new rational design strategies, based on an in-depth knowledge of protein dynamics and advanced modelling and new simulation techniques are required. Other challenging frontier areas include dynamics of motor proteins; prediction of the effects of pathogenic mutations on protein function. The accurate prediction of free energy of binding is still in its infancy and needs much further investigation. Finally, kinetics of biomolecular reactions will become the next big topic. It is clear that high end computing resource can provide the necessary power and capability to provide inroads into this vital area. This is important because it is becoming increasingly apparent that kinetics of drug binding is a key factor that the pharmaceutical sector should really be looking at in terms of a major dictator of potency.

HECBioSim is now well established, supporting work of many groups across the UK in the growing field of biomolecular simulation. We benefit from an Advisory Group containing members from industry, as we as international biomolecular simulation experts and experimental scientists. The Advisory Board was expanded and refreshed for the renewal and consists of: Dr. Nicolas Foloppe (Vernalis plc, Chair); Dr. Colin Edge (GlaxoSmithKline); Dr. Mike King (UCB Pharmaceuticals); Dr. Mike Mazanetz (Evotec AG); Dr. Garrett Morris (Crysalin Ltd.); Dr. Gary Tresadern (Johnson and Johnson Pharmaceuticals); Dr. Richard Ward (AstraZeneca); Prof. Modesto Orozco (IRB, Barcelona); Prof. Tony Watts, (Oxford, NMR); Dr. Pete Bond (A*STAR Bioinformatics Institute Singapore). We aim to foster industrial collaborations and collaborations with experimentalists (e.g. joint workshops with CCPN, Institute of Physics (Sarah Harris, Leeds Physics); see e.g. case studies. A particular theme for strategic development will be multiscale modelling, building on collaborations between several groups in the Consortium and the other CCPs. This theme reflects the inclusive and forward looking philosophy of HecBioSim, which is a community open to new ideas, keen to develop new methods, and ultimately to use HEC to drive exciting new science.

The Consortium model allows new collaborations to develop. The recent reduction in time allocated to HECBioSim has meant that we can support fewer projects. There is significantly more demand for computer time than we can accommodate through our current allocation. We intend to work with Tier 2 Centres to explore possibilities for applications, and e.g. to test emerging architectures for biomolecular simulation. 

Edina Rosta (Computational Chemistry, Kings College London) comments: &amp;quot;HECBioSim enables my group to perform biomolecular simulations at the high standards required for JACS, Angewandte, etc. Without this consortium I would not be able to perform the necessary calculations leading to publishable work in top journals as our local university resources are limited and the hpc systems are not well maintained&amp;quot;.

Regarding financial support: the administrative support provided via the consortium grant is essential to the functioning of HECBioSim. This role is currently undertaken by Simone Breckell who not only administers, allocates time to projects and arranges panel meetings but has also done a fantastic job collating the extensive information for this EPSRC report.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c718729fa8f1.76571364</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Annual report to EPSRC; details below</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2017</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8E3693A9-7055-4153-A678-C5BD2ED93496</gtr:id><gtr:title>Structural/mechanistic insights into the efficacy of nonclassical ?-lactamase inhibitors against extensively drug resistant Stenotrophomonas maltophilia clinical isolates.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Molecular microbiology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2107490ba1ae5f5dd21b0c1d4add91ca"><gtr:id>2107490ba1ae5f5dd21b0c1d4add91ca</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Calvopi?a K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0950-382X</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fd5aed95972.12520479</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4F10983E-FB0A-4757-BFBF-695E5BB43ABD</gtr:id><gtr:title>Pore structures and mechanical properties of porous titanium scaffolds by bidirectional freeze casting.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Materials science &amp; engineering.
