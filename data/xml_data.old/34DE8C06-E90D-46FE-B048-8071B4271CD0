PTMs play an important role in modulating several biological processes and is one of the methods used by nature to increase the repertoire of chemical functional groups in proteins. Methylation of arginine is an important PTM that modulates the activity of numerous proteins involved in RNA processing, transcriptional regulation, signal transduction and DNA repair. Tyrosine phosphorylation, another PTM, that plays an important role in cell-cycle progression, cell proliferation, cellular homeostasis, neural activity, transcriptional activation and ageing. Many diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders, are associated with abnormal levels of PTMs. Despite the importance of PTMs in biology, it is often difficult to obtain a homogeneous sample of protein with specific PTMs. This is mainly because cells have competing mechanisms to install and remove PTMs, and samples of post-translationally modified proteins also contain unmodified proteins. It is often difficult to separate post-translationally modified proteins from their unmodified analogues. The problem is further compounded if the protein has multiple sites for PTMs. In addition, proteomics analyses have revealed numerous previously unidentified sites of PTMs on many proteins. Often enzymes that install these PTMs are not known, thus further limiting the access to these post-translationally modified proteins. To address these challenges, here we propose to develop methods for genetic site-specific incorporation of methylarginines and phosphotyrosine. This work would provide facile access to several important post-translationally modified proteins. 

Proteins are synthesized in all organisms by a biological machine called the ribosome. The ribosome uses messenger RNA (mRNA) as a template and transfer RNA (tRNA) as an adaptor molecule to catalyse protein synthesis using a set of rules defined by the genetic code. For each naturally occurring amino acid there are, 1) a unique set of triplet bases in the DNA or mRNA, called codons, which correspond to the amino acid, and 2) a unique set of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS)/ tRNA pairs. aaRSs catalyze the charging of their corresponding tRNAs with their corresponding amino acids. During protein synthesis, the charged tRNA is taken to the ribosome where it binds to its cognate codon on the mRNA in the small subunit of the ribosome, and concurrently an amino acid is added to the growing peptide chain in the large subunit. 

Genetic incorporation of unnatural amino acids in cells has been achieved by assigning an amber stop codon or quadruplet codons to unnatural amino acids and supplying the cells with orthogonal aaRS/ tRNA pairs. Orthogonal aaRS/ tRNA pairs do not interfere with the tRNA synthetases and the tRNAs of the host cell, and specifically recognize the unnatural amino acid. Using this approach, numerous unnatural amino acids have been genetically encoded in different organisms. However, only a small number of PTMs have been genetically encoded. 

In this proposal, we explore different approaches to identify new orthogonal aaRS/ tRNA pairs in E. coli to enable genetic encoding of methylarginines and phosphotyrosine.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Genetic encoding of unnatural amino acids into proteins expressed in cells and animals is achieved by: a) assigning amber stop codon or quadruplet codons to an unnatural amino acid, and b) providing the cells with aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS)/ tRNA pair that does not cross react with aaRSs and tRNAs in the host cell i.e., it is orthogonal to the host cell aaRS/ tRNA pairs. The orthogonal aaRS catalyses the charging of orthogonal tRNA with unnatural amino acid. Using this approach, numerous unnatural amino acids have been genetically encoded in different organisms. However, only a few post-translational modifications (PTMs) have been genetically encoded. In this proposal, we present multiple approaches to achieve genetic site-specific incorporation of methylarginines and phosphotyrosine. 

We have identified two new aaRS/ tRNA pairs, which are candidate orthogonal aaRS/ tRNA pairs in E.coli. These aaRS/ tRNA pairs are selected from evolutionarily distant eukaryotes and present a greater chance of being orthogonal in E. coli. In addition, the selected aaRSs have shown to express well in E. coli, and crystal structures of all these aaRSs are available. Our preliminary results show that amber stop codon decoding and quadruplet codon decoding selected tRNA counterparts are orthogonal in E.coli. In the first part of this work, we will evolve the anticodon binding pocket of selected aaRSs to specifically and efficiently recognize their corresponding tRNAs (with modified anticodons) using a unique directed evolution-based approach. Subsequently, the amino acid binding pockets of these aaRS will be evolved to genetically encode mono-methylarginine, symmetric-dimethylarginine and photocaged phosphotyrosine in separate selection experiments. As a back up strategy, we will also evolve the amino acid binding pocket of Pyrrolysyl-aaRS to genetically encode these unnatural amino acids.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Methylation of arginine, and phosphorylation of tyrosine are important post-translational modifications in nature. In this proposal, we will develop methods for ribosomal expression of proteins in E. coli that contain these post-translational modifications. 

Academic Impact: Post-translational modification of arginine and tyrosine play an important role in several biological processes, including transcriptional activation, cell-cycle progression, RNA metabolism, and immune response. Easy access to proteins with site-specifically incorporated modified arginine and tyrosine residues will have a tremendous impact on the understanding of these fundamental processes in biology. 

Economic and Societal Impact: Perturbation of post-translational modification of arginine and tyrosine can lead to diseases such as cancer and neurodegeneration. Facile access to post-translationally modified proteins will assist in studies on these diseases. Private and public sector laboratories that are interested in diseases associated with PTMs of arginine and tyrosine will benefit from methods developed in this proposal.
In addition, the postdoctoral scientist appointed on this project will develop skills in synthetic biology and protein engineering. These skills are transferable and can be applied to other fields of biology. 

Industrial impact: The genetic tools developed in proposal will be of commercial importance. Methods for large-scale production of proteins containing PTMs will allow development of novel therapeutics that can target these PTMs.
