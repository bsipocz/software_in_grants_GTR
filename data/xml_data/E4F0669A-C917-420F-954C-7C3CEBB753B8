&lt;p>Professor Carroll is one of the world authorities on consumption and saving behaviour. Who over the years&amp;nbsp; has worked extensively on the modelling of consumer choices with particular emphasis on precautionary saving behaviour.&amp;nbsp;Professor Carrol&amp;nbsp;has applied ideas generated&amp;nbsp;to explain the demand for housing and durables and more generally to the understanding of saving decisions, and has just finished working as a member of the Council of Economic Advisors in Washington. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>Professor Carroll is currently working on the effects of the stimulus package on consumption behaviour. This is clearly a topic of first order importance for the design of fiscal (and monetary) policy. The idea of this collaboration is to study the effectiveness of policies like the recent VAT reforms in the UK which have the potential to incentivise consumers to move purchases forward and provide a stimulus to consumption spending. However, the willingness of consumers to bring forward consumption in recessions is less clear-cut. Our research collaboration with Professor Carroll will explore the strength of these arguments. &lt;br />&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>5000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Retiring Together?

While many of their ideas about how to proceed were plausible on their face, I was able to explain to them why many of the ideas they were pursuing were not likely to be successful. (One of the biases of academic publication is that ideas which seem like good ones but do not pan out tend not to get published; this can lead to a lot of waste, as the fact that an idea did not pan out is not public knowledge and so others are likely to try it again and again and fail again and again).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Specifically, I advised them against any attempt to employ Euler equation methods to project future spending, and instead encouraged a microsimulation approach in which they would try to measure the effects of policies on the income streams of specific categories of households, and then make assumptions about the respective marginal propensities to consume of those kinds of households out of those kinds of income to produce an overall effect.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4E08C97F-49D3-4A38-9A5D-277353BBEF41</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545361b6de7173.10377397</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-074-27-0017</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/I005331/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
