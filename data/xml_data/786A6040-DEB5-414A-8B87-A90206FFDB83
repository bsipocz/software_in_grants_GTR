This research examines adults' and children's friendships in diverse urban localities and how these relationships help to shape everyday life. The research also explores what those friendships reveal about the nature and extent of ethnic diversity and social divisions in contemporary multicultural society. We are focusing on the friendships adults and children make in and through primary schools, as these can be places where adults and children from different backgrounds meet and interact. At the heart of the project are the following questions:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>whether adults and children make and maintain friendships with those who are differently socially situated to themselves&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>how those friendships develop&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>how differences in social and/or ethnic background shape and affect those relationships&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>how those differences are routinely negotiated and managed.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Our data will contribute empirical evidence to the often rather abstract debates on social cohesion; assess the potential of individual friendships to contribute towards that cohesion in heterogeneous areas, and offer data evaluating the role of the school in contributing to the development of resilient mixed communities and social cohesion.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project is timely. Current policy interest in the possibilities of sociality, civility, community and informal forms of social capital for achieving social cohesion, inclusion and well-being mean that the project's potential impact is significant. One of the central ambitions of this project is to highlight ways in which schools and contemporary policy making in the field of ethnic and cultural diversity might usefully engage with the affective and intimate forms and practices of social interaction that are connected to local schools and environments. Policy makers will benefit as the study will contribute empirical evidence to the current debates on social cohesion. This project will add the necessary detail as to how children and adults develop relationships across social class and ethnic differences, and what degree of impact such relationships have on how adults and children understand and feel part of their locality and relate to 'others' within it. Additionally we will offer an evaluation of the role of the school in contributing towards building resilient mixed communities and developing social cohesion. This aspect of the project is likely to be also of value and interest to educational policy-makers and education practitioners. The data on children's friendships and parental attempts to manage these will be of interest to a range of education professionals, as these issues can contribute significantly to children's well being at school, and may be the subject of parental approaches to teachers, if children's friendships prove problematic. The issues covered in the research will have particular resonance for teachers, education providers and community organisations in diverse localities.

There are four main aspects to the way in which the research will dialogically involve policy makers, practitioners and users.

The first relates to local policy and community actors. We will convene a local advisory group drawn from the broader North London locality. The members will be selected from among key individuals within the case study schools, from parents and user networks across the public and third and community sectors, and academics with relevant expertise. This group will operate to enable and encourage an active process of knowledge exchange between the group, their networks and the research team. The group will meet twice during the project's lifetime. As well as allowing us to report on emergent findings, again the purpose will be to facilitate knowledge exchange, encouraging and enabling participants to suggest ways in which the project might fruitfully be developed. The meetings will be an opportunity for dialogue, rather than exposition.

The second relates to the national level. We will organise two end-of-project workshops, aimed at engaging with academics and wider audiences drawn from education, public policy and third sector organisations, and inviting them to engage with the findings that are emerging from the project.

The third is centrally expressed in the project's research design. This recognises the need for an iterative, active and reflexive engagement with key stakeholders, such as the head teachers and teachers, in order to feed in findings, discuss meanings, and 'test' interpretations and policy implications. Project interviews with headteachers will include dialogue about the project's findings. The issues arising from the fieldwork will be discussed in a more detailed way with these participants from the start and throughout the project. 

The fourth relates to the possibility and necessity of wider public engagement. We will be utilising various media to open up discussion around the project, including a project web-site, the use of a blog, and through radio programmes such as Radio 4's Thinking Allowed.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-02-11</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>261621</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Blog for British Educational Research Association</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>437FF84C-8073-4189-96A3-0A1D217AE6AF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Further interest in project stimulated and some individuals made direct contact.

We engaged in considerable discussion with people attending the fairs about the research and its findings, and people often responded that they had not thought previously about the issues around diversity which were raising.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>55faa21ff164e0.90268844</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Our findings have had three main audiences to date: 1) academics, policy makers and practitioners, 2) the research participants at the case study schools (involving children, parents, teachers, governors) and 3) a wider public.

1) Academics, policy makers and practitioners
Our research with its focus on friendships that children and adults make, maintain, or avoid with those different to themselves in terms of social class and/or ethnicity, contributes to current and recent work in geography, education studies and sociology. In terms of the academic audience, we have attended, at the time of writing (update March 2017) ten national and international conferences, National Science Week 2014, and four invited seminars. We have also used the research methodology and findings to inform teaching at undergraduate and masters level at UCL Institute of Education and the University of Surrey. We have developed six papers to date for peer-reviewed, international journals (four papers published, one forthcoming, and one under review). We have also written a full project report, launched 1st July 2015, at UCL Institute of Education. This was a well-attended project launch to which we invited academics and policy makers. We have a book contract with Palgrave Macmillan for the manuscript to be delivered in July 2017. The research has been featured in ESRC's Society Now (spring 2016, no. 24). Our advisory group for the project included teachers, policy makers and academics, and they provided us with invaluable advice during the course of the project and useful contacts in terms of dissemination. We have written a further paper aimed at practitioners that will be published in the College of Teachers' publication Education Today in September 2016. We presented the research findings at a UCL Institute of Education Research and Development network conference in June 2016 that brings together practitioners from IOE partner schools, and also distributed copies of the final research report and a booklet, 'Children Talking About Their Friends' (see below).


2) The research participants
The staff at the three case study schools, and parent and children participants received feedback specific to their school after the fieldwork period. This took the form of three short, accessible reports per school written for each of the three main audiences at each school - teachers, parents and children. We sent the reports to parent participants, and arranged to visit the schools to feedback directly to the children and staff. These feedback sessions sparked considerable discussion amongst child and teacher audiences. 
Over the life-time of the project we became aware that in order to maximise our engagement and reach with parents, children and the school community, we needed to visit the schools, rather than invite participants to UCL Institute of Education. However, meetings held at school can also be problematic for parents to attend owing to work and child-care commitments. Another strategy was needed. After careful consideration, we arranged to attend the three case study school summer fairs (June 2015). We had a stall at each, banners to identify ourselves, and a tombola activity (to attract people to the stall and to 'fit in' with the summer fair modus operandi). We produced a shorter, more accessible form of our final project report, and also an additional booklet entitled 'Children Talking About Their Friends'. The latter was a structured compilation of the children who participated in the research talking about why they liked their friends, the tensions around friendships, and how these could be resolved. We saw this booklet as a starting point for parents and teachers to talk about friendships with children, and for children to read the words of others, reflecting both the highs and lows of friendship. This booklet was additional to the project outputs we had originally planned. Copies of this booklet and of the summarised research report were very well-received at the summer fairs, often acting as a 'way in' to talk with people who were visiting the fairs about the specific issues highlighted by the research on friendship across difference. The strategy of disseminating the project's findings through attendance at the summer fairs proved to be a successful and innovative one, and allowed us to engage in conversations about the research with the diverse population of teachers, families and others from the local communities who attended the fairs, many of whom had not had prior involvement with social research projects.

3) The wider public
The research as a whole has been reported in the TES (https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/theres-no-such-thing-race-or-class-%E2%80%93-long-were-classroom-study-finds), the BBC (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-33329575) and was The Guardian's Research of the Week for 3/7/15. 

We kept a well-maintained project website, which has had, to date, over 3000 visitors. This featured a regular blog entry that engaged both with the progress of the project, and also discussed events in the public domain, including the Birmingham 'Trojan horse' events, and various media stories of the moment (e.g. an incident related to a child's birthday party that made local, national and international headlines). We continue to up-date this blog, on a less frequent basis. We also tweeted about the progress of the project, and have been re-tweeted. We have written a blog for the British Education Research Association, and two for the UCL IOE blog (latest September 2016). We have also compiled a poster for the UCL London 2034 event (summer 2016) that aims to introduce research in an accessible manner to a broad cross-section of the public. The research is also scheduled to be discussed in the UCL Festival of Culture 2017.
There will soon be a Faculti interview with Carol Vincent talking about the project (filmed Feb 2017) which will shortly be available on https://faculti.net/. A meeting is planned with representatives from The Challenge, 'the UK's leading charity for building a more integrated society' to discuss the project findings.

We expect that when our book is published, we will have another opportunity to introduce the issues highlighted by our research into the public sphere.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>37E24A19-8FD7-41C6-8B38-DE0D7B4DD4FD</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>55f69648e6d743.37190279</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Drawing on a data set of 114 interviews, the project has delivered significant theoretical and empirical findings regarding affective social relationships within locally based, complex, socially and ethnically diverse urban populations. We detail these key findings below.

The research shows that the adults and children who took part in the study did make and maintain friendships with those socially and ethnically different to themselves (RQ1: 'Do socially and ethnically mixed adult and child friendships exist ?'). However, for both adults and children, ethnically mixed friendships were more common than cross-class friendships. The children, more so than the adults, mixed across both ethnic difference and social class; indeed very nearly all the children had close friends from a different ethnic group to themselves (we defined 'close' as meaning amongst their 'top five' friends). There were also close cross-class friendships, a majority of the children had close friends - in their top five - who had a different social background to themselves. However, when we looked at who the children said their closest friend was, there were still a significant number of friendships across ethnic difference (nearly three quarters). There were far fewer 'best friend' friendships across class difference (just over a quarter of the children).

For the adult participants, school was a source of support, contact and friendship networks for themselves as well as their children. School based friendships varied from thicker to thinner levels of intimacy: 'deep' friendships through 'lighter' friendships, to friendships of arrangement and 'nodding relationships'. Although there were examples of deeper friendships, for the majority of adults' school-based friendships tended to be 'lighter', more temporally and spatially tied to the period of the children's attendance at school. Friendships did take place across difference, but more sustained/deep friendships did not tend to cross class difference, although there were a few examples of such friendships across ethnic difference. However, in response to RQ 2 ('How is class and/or ethnic difference perceived and negotiated?') we argue that despite this tendency to view difference as an inhibitor to friendships, it was possible to identify a small group of parents who were from minority ethnic backgrounds, and had access to middle class resources, who had an explicitly open attitude towards difference and who acted intentionally and purposively, to develop social relationships across difference. It is also the case that the adult respondents in general practised mixing and homophilly in different parts of their daily life, in different circumstances, to different extents and based on different spaces e.g. (school, work, religious, political, cultural community groups/societies). 

RQ 3 asked 'How do adults understand, experience and respond to class and/or ethnic difference in relation to children's friendships?' We highlight here the strong support for children attending diverse schools, but paradoxically few parents sought to facilitate children's mixed friendships out of school. Children's out of school time was still very much organized by their parents and they tended to spend this time (at e.g. paid for clubs/activities or religious classes) with others like themselves. We also developed a policy-relevant analysis (shortly to be published) of how teachers in the three case study schools addressed issues of friendship and diversity, as part of a wider programme of social and emotional learning.

In response to RQ4 'Do mixed adult friendships create and sustain social and cultural exchange, capacity and resource?' we argue that despite this propensity for 'sameness' in adult friendships, relationships in the three playgrounds where very diverse families gathered at the beginning and end of the school day are generally amicable. The primary schools were a key site in which social interactions across difference took place. Even casual interactions - simple everyday 'hi hello, how are you' exchanges between parents - were felt by research participants to be important for creating friendly atmospheres - of social connection and exchange - and a sense of belonging in the school and its immediate surrounds. Although adult engagement across difference is slight, we suggest that the routine, day-to-day presence of being in the school world requires attention to be paid to others and builds processes of civic conviviality, that is, the collective use of the shared social resource of the school requires engagement with and recognition of others.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>There are a number of possible areas for development:
- We have discussed the way in which schools and teachers engage with friendship issues and tensions, the need to take children's friendships seriously, and the tenor and direction of common approaches to Social and Emotional Learning (SEL). However this was not the main focus of our project and it would be interesting to do some more classroom based work here, focusing on approaches to SEL across a range of sites, particularly focusing on teachers' responses to encouraging friendships across class and ethnic diversity.
- Classroom based research would also allow a more detailed picture of the development of children's friendships, the formation of networks and the durability of these. It would also provide more understanding around how newly arrived children (often recent migrants) form friendships in the classroom and settle into school. 
- Developing our findings on adult friendships could include a consideration of how the informal capital of school friendship networks might be used to develop inclusion and neighbourhood strategies, and to develop thinking about friendships as a key social relationship in understanding personal lives and decision making.
- The localities in which the case study schools were based were gentrified to different degrees and the process is obviously an on-going one. In the most established area of gentrification, working class adults who had grown up in the locality, spoke about feeling marginalised in terms of the arrival of new services and communities. Our study is helpful in mapping the way in which gentrification needs to be recognised as taking uneven and partial forms in different localities and that this will impact on social relationships within them. Further research could explore tensions around the process of gentrification, a particularly topical issue in contemporary London. 
- Some of the families to whom we spoke were recently arrived migrants, struggling to varying extents with the re-settlement process. Further research could explore the ways in which new migrants seek to develop social networks.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>3C034DEC-90B8-4964-BACD-C69A52414968</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>55f6c647b8ef34.37794573</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social
