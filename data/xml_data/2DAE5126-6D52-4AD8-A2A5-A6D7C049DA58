These quantum devices promise advantages in a wide range of information technology and scientific applications. These include the exchange of information with unbreakable security, sensors that provide the ultimate measurement precision and the development of computers that can solve particular problems exponentially faster than a modern supercomputer. Photons are also the perfect system to test scientific theories for quantum mechanics, given their low noise characteristics and ease of manipulation. If optical networks for photonic control and detection are now well understood, the controllable generation of photons is currently the main bottleneck to achieve complex quantum circuits. This is currently limiting both the development of disruptive quantum technologies and the design of complex experiments based on light. 
This project aims to deliver single photon sources that show high performance, are bright and scalable. We will study emitters based on colour centres embedded in silicon carbide, a semiconductor material commonly used for electronics, making them manufacturable with current nanofabrication technologies. The photon emitters can be created with high spatial precision, offering the possibility of placing them in complex integrated devices. We will develop, optimise and fabricate nanometre sized optical devices in silicon carbide that couple to the semiconductor emitters. This will provide single photon sources that can be used as a building block for a multitude of quantum technologies based on light, including communication, sensing and computing. The possibility to integrate such photon source with additional integrated photonic components opens the way to fully functional monolithic devices operating at ultralow power that can be of interest to a broader spectrum of ICT industries.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Quantum Technologies represent an increasingly attractive topic in research worldwide for the past decade. This growth of interest was driven by the promise of profoundly disruptive communication, sensing and computing technologies. The UK has a high growth, high technology business landscape capable of investing and developing new disruptive technologies to create new high value markets based on quantum mechanics. This First Grant application holds great promise to provide manufacturable devices that can help to solve one of the outstanding problems of quantum optics, allowing the development of devices that will have a revolutionising impact on society.
Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is the first commercial application of quantum information that was transferred from academic laboratories into the real world. Systems that use quantum security protocols have been progressively installed and used. The possible market spans from companies that need to exchange secure data, like in financial markets, to database holders for medical, bank or intellectual property information. The USA, Japan and Switzerland have already demonstrated QKD networks, and similar facilities are needed in the UK to protect government and financial information vital for the National security and wealth. The results obtained in this project are of fundamental interest to develop new transmission devices that can be used to increase the capacity and security of photonic networks. Bright single photon sources will be able to increase the communication rate and provide viable protocols to boost the capabilities of local and metropolitan links of interest to various ICT companies. 
Modern life is based on accurate measurements performed by sensors. Their application is ubiquitous, from healthcare and diagnostics to safety and security as well as in advanced scientific applications. New sensor technologies are used by manufacturers to provide new capabilities to their products while improving performance and efficiency, and they can increase industrial productivity by improving product quality and reducing downtime. A vast number of modern sensors are based on optical properties, including gyroscopes used in automotive and aeronautic industry, microscopy characterisations and plasmon resonance measurements for biological analyses. This project promises the development of high purity single photons that can be used to increase the sensitivity of common measurements based on light. The analysis of small quantities of unknown materials can benefit since quantum sensors promise measurements performed with the lowest possible power for characterisation of biological or chemical compounds. The integrated nature of the sources will be useful for scalable sensors, like gyroscopes, that can replace bulky and expensive alternatives in a wide range of industrial applications. 
Finally, reliable single photon sources can also be used to develop quantum simulators and computers based on light. Big data and software companies worldwide are investing in this endeavour, and might benefit from a scalable source of qubits to solve complex problems, from defence and security to big data analysis.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>91308</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3D533A8A-858E-475E-8382-71D12C234692</gtr:id><gtr:title>Linear integrated optics in 3C silicon carbide.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Optics express</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/bd7b7790d20fa0ae156cb66f4942a415"><gtr:id>bd7b7790d20fa0ae156cb66f4942a415</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Martini F</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1094-4087</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fec275015b3.81069229</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P003710/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C88380A2-9C65-425D-B4FB-4E289FACB800</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Atomic &amp; molecular physics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8ECC9D35-20DE-4F19-8A8A-07D65859D6F3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Light-Matter Interactions</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
