There is currently no cure or treatment. The most common cause is the 'Z' mutation which leads to the accumulation of misfolded a1AT 'polymers' in liver cells. As part of a previous MRC grant, we discovered a surprising mechanism of Z-a1AT polymerization and the structural feature that causes Z-a1AT to misfold. The goal of the current research is to study the feature, that we named the 'Z-pocket', in more detail. Compounds that bind to the Z-pocket could rescue the folding of Z-a1AT and effectively cure the disease. We will use X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance to determine the properties of the Z-pocket and to see if previously identified compounds rescue folding by filling the pocket. Successful completion of this project will set the stage for the discovery of new drugs for the treatment of a1AT-deficiency.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The most common cause of alpha-1-antitrypsin (a1AT) deficiency is the Z-mutation (E342K), found in 1 in 25 people of European descent. Emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) result from the impaired secretion of a1AT, and liver manifestations, such as cirrhosis, fibrosis and cancer, are caused by the accumulation of misfolded 'polymers' of a1AT in hepatocytes. Development of lung and liver disease requires two affected alleles, the most common being ZZ and ZS. The prevalence of ZZ and ZS is 1:2000 across Europe, but differ in distribution (ZZ is 1:500 in Latvia and ZS is up to 1:200 in Spain and Portugal). The underlying protein, a1AT, is a member of the serpin family of protease inhibitors. Its main role is to protect tissues from proteases released from inflammatory cells, including neutrophil elastase. ZZ homozygocity results in circulating levels of 15% normal, and a mere doubling of secretion would be sufficient to protect from development of disease. Currently there is no effective treatment for a1AT deficiency. As part of a previous MRC project grant, we determined the molecular basis of a1AT polymerisation, and unexpectedly discovered how the Z-mutation may affect protein folding. The Glu-to-Lys mutation alters the conformation of an adjacent loop, extracts a Phe from a buried position, and creates a 350 cubic angstrom pocket. This pocket exists in the native protein in solution and can be filled by hydrophobic compounds. A compound similar to Phe (4-phenylbuteric acid) has been shown to be effective in cell and animal models as a chemical chaperone for the improvement in secretion of Z-a1AT. The goal of the current grant is to establish the existence of this 'Z-pocket' in solution, to determine the mode of action of PBA, and to establish tools that will allow the identification and characterisation of novel chemical chaperones for treatment and prevention of a1AT-deficiency caused by the common Z-mutation.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The groups that would benefit directly from the outcome of the proposed research are: 1) academic researchers in the serpin field, protein folding, protein misfolding, age-related degenerative diseases, etc., as outlined in the Academic Beneficiaries section; 2) the commercial medical research sector, in particular, in realising the tractability and prevalence of a1AT-deficiency; and, 3) patient groups, including the Alpha-1-Foundation and Alpha-1-Awareness, UK, because our results show that there is hope for development of a treatment; 4) the NHS and other public health services, by reducing burden of chronic conditions; 5) UK economy, by improvement in productivity, potential commercialisation with a UK-based company.
Estimates for the frequency of ZZ homozygocity in the general population vary, but it is often reported to be between 1:1800 and 1:3000. In that case, there are between 105,000 and 175,000 carriers in the USA, and between 21,000 and 35,000 in the UK. Frequency of SZ homozygocity are similar, so the potential numbers of affected individuals is simply doubled (approximately 300,000 individuals in the USA and 60,000 in the UK). At the moment, most carriers are undiagnosed, because of the lack of safe and effective treatment, although knowledge of increased risk could affect behaviour in ways that might reduce the chance of developing lung and liver diseases (no smoking, no drinking). However, there are commercial kits available for genotyping the Z and S alleles, and charities in the US and the UK provide free genetic screening services. 
The development of a safe and effective treatment for a1AT-deficiency caused by the Z mutation would thus impact many people and improve the quality of their lives. If the drug were developed by a UK-based company it could potentially benefit the economy. Additional benefits to the public purse would be the reduced burden on the NHS of the chronic diseases caused by a1AT-deficiency.
Another benefit from this project is the support of academic efforts to translate discoveries into new therapies. Talented postdoctoral researchers will be exposed to the techniques and mindset of translational research. This will undoubtedly influence their decisions regarding the direction of their future research. 
A realistic time scale for a drug to be available to patients is 10 years. However, this can be significantly shortened if we discover a compound already licenced for clinical use (eg. PBA). It may even be possible that a dietary supplement such as L- or D-phenylalanine might prove effective in increasing in Z-a1AT levels. All other impacts will be felt incrementally during and following the granting period.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>533147</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs><gtr:spinOutOutput><gtr:companyName>Z Factor Ltd</gtr:companyName><gtr:description>Z Factor Limited is a drug discovery company founded in 2015 to identify and develop therapeutic agents to treat alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency. The company was created by Index Ventures in partnership with the University of Cambridge. 

Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic disorder that affects 1 in 2,000 people of European descent. The most common disease-causing mutation is the Z-variant. Z alpha-1-antitrypsin is fully functional when secreted, but most of the protein misfolds and accumulates in liver cells as polymers. People suffering from alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency can present either early in life or late in life with liver cirrhosis. However, the most common manifestation of alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is emphysema, generally diagnosed in midlife. Current treatments are limited to lung or liver transplantation and augmentation therapy, whereby protein purified from normal blood is repeatedly administered via weekly intravenous infusions. 

Z Factor is exploiting insight into the structure of the Z-variant of alpha-1-antitrypsin derived from research conducted in the laboratory of Professor Jim Huntington at the University of Cambridge. Z Factor is therefore uniquely placed to design and develop novel therapeutic agents to correct the misfolding of the Z variant and to thereby address an important and unmet medical need.</gtr:description><gtr:id>95F38A84-7822-4395-89E5-DFF26AD916C5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The company has successfully discovered several drug-like compounds that rescue Z antitrypsin folding in in vivo models, and has passed from a seed round of &amp;pound;1.1M to a &amp;pound;7M Series A completed in March 2017.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e00cb7790979.31790262</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:url>http://zfactor.co.uk/</gtr:url><gtr:yearCompanyFormed>2015</gtr:yearCompanyFormed></gtr:spinOutOutput></gtr:spinOutOutputs></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>FB5027A9-215C-4EDE-8245-D30D88DDEC00</gtr:id><gtr:title>The shapes of Z-a1-antitrypsin polymers in solution support the C-terminal domain-swap mechanism of polymerization.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Biophysical journal</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6c3aceb7b3d783fb0ebc0ca2f1233e07"><gtr:id>6c3aceb7b3d783fb0ebc0ca2f1233e07</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Behrens MA</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0006-3495</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56dff3165943f5.92047958</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/L017431/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>78FE8F42-8AFB-48F8-8662-37D541AD95BF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Congenital Disorders</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
