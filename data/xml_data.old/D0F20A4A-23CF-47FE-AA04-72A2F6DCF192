Apraxia after left fronto-parietal damage is widely interpreted as evidence of damage to representations of familiar actions, but an alternative view is that there is impaired planning or control of hand-tool postural relationships. We compared reaching for familiar tools with reaching for abstract objects with the prediction that both would be equally impaired by this postural deficit. 



Methods:

Patients with unilateral lesions and age-matched controls reached rapidly for inverted tools or for abstract objects under conditions which required rapid inversion of the hand during reaching, either to avoid a barrier or to carry out a future action with them.



Results: 

Apraxic patients frequently failed to invert the hand to grasp inverted tools by the handle or did so abnormally slowly, whereas inversion of the hand when reaching for abstract objects was largely unimpaired. Frequency of errors in tool grasping correlated with severity of apraxia. 



Conclusions: 

This selective impairment in grasping tools for use is consistent with the theory of damaged action representations, but evidence from elsewhere suggests that these are cognitive representations of hand-tool interaction, not visuomotor engrams as the classical theory of apraxia suggests.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-9655229309.2526762b12033e</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Impairment of actual tool-use in apraxia : a new method for detecting deficits in grasp selection</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:id>5A34B7E2-64F5-4B84-822D-2F68EDE97A0F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Background and aims.

Ideomotor apraxia is common after left hemisphere stroke and can be a barrier to rehabilitation.* Traditional assessment involves gesture imitation or pantomime of tool-use but the everyday functional implications are unclear. Measurement of actual tool use is difficult because of the great variability in normal tool-use actions. A simpler approach may be to observe rotation of the wrist during reaches towards upright or inverted tools. 



Method

Participants reached rapidly for the handle of a tool which was upright or inverted. This was compared on interleaved trials with reaching for a rod or bar where inversion of the hand was determined by a physical barrier. Performance was videoed and accelerometers were worn on the wrist. Five left hemisphere apraxic patients were compared with 5 right hemisphere cases and age-matched healthy controls. 



Results

Rotation of the wrist was unimpaired when reaching for a rod or bar but apraxic patients showed more frequent failure to invert the hand when reaching for inverted tools than normal controls or right hemisphere cases (p&amp;lt;.01). However, there was no correlation between gesture imitation scores and frequency of rotation errors. In addition accelerometer data indicated late rotation when reaching for non-tools by some apraxic patients.



Discussion

Failure to invert the hand when reaching rapidly for an inverted tool appears common in apraxia and can be observed even without special equipment. However the relationship to severity of apraxia on traditional measures is unclear. Additional left hemisphere cases with and without apraxia are being recruited to study this.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-4855942805.1635092b12003c</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project was concerned with the question of how humans are able to translate their cognitive knowledge of tools and other familiar manipulable objects in their environment into appropriate motor commands for reaching and grasping. This was addressed by working with stroke patients in whom this process was impaired (cases of ideomotor apraxia). A first achievement of the project was to devise and demonstrate a new method for measuring interactions with tools. This method uses sensitive measurement of hand rotation as an indicator of the application of tool-use knowledge, and this offers a significant advance on previous methodologies involving simple behaviour rating scales or over-complex measures of joint motion. A second contribution of the project was to test predictions from the two streams theory of action and perception (Milner &amp;amp; Goodale, 2008) which suggests that there are separate brain systems for cognition and visual control of action, and that the two have to work in concert to allow normal purposeful behaviour such as use of tools. Consistent with this theory, we demonstrated that apraxic patients were selectively impaired in their interactions with familiar tools but not with simple geometric forms for which there was no need to apply cognitive knowledge. Furthermore we showed (as predicted) that this effect was specific to patients with damage to the left cerebral hemisphere. This has added to evidence for a special role of left hemisphere systems in representation of tool knowledge and opens the door to future research (with patients and normal participants) into how this information is encoded and utilised.

Subsequent work with normal volunteers probed the limits of integration of action and cognition by requiring rapid reaching to tools or objects which changed their orientation as they were reached for. The timing and accuracy of these responses was consistent with the two streams model.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>There are potential applications in stroke rehabilitation where apraxia is a barrier to recovery.
