More specifically,&amp;nbsp;it aims to uncover the processes supporting the management, content and scope of the websites of five parliaments in Europe and to ascertain the extent to which the image projected on these websites corresponds to strategic decisions about how these parliaments want to be perceived. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>The parliaments are the British, European, French, Portuguese and Scottish. We will enquire into the extent to which the management of parliament's image is integrated in the wider governance of parliament, asking in particular who decides on the content and scope of parliamentary websites and whether these are administrative, political or technical decisions. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>The comparative nature of this project will allow us to investigate differences and similarities in the systems of governance of parliament's image in different institutional contexts. This is a two-year research project. It adopts mainly a qualitative research approach and it is based on 50 in-depth interviews with senior parliamentary staff and politicians across the five parliaments, complemented by a content analysis of the respective parliamentary websites.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-10-11</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-05-12</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>58729</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Guest talk 'Managing Parliamentary Websites', World eParliament Conference (South Africa)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>231D7E16-1423-4F2C-AC6C-D1835CEFB2AC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Over 400 parliamentary officials from 80 different countries attended the event, with quite a few contacting me following the presentation.

Academically, the intellectual impact of the project so far is as follows: identifying the characteristics of a parliamentary institution which determine the specific nature of parliament's image; identifying the extent of the impact of the internet on parliament and, particularly, its ability to shape its image; determining the importance of administrative structures within parliament in terms of its impact on policies developed, namely in public engagement; identifying the specific challenges that social media present to parliament; defining the activity of parliamentary public engagement and, specifically, a five-steps process of public engagement. Besides conference presentations, we produced the following publications, which draw directly from this research:
? &amp;quot;The Pursuit of Legitimacy as a Key Driver for Public Engagement: the case of the European Parliament&amp;quot;, Parliamentary Affairs, 2012.
? Edition of double special issue for The Journal of Legislative Studies on Parliaments and Citizens, vol.18, 3/4, 2012 - forthcoming as a book in 2013 by Routdedge.
? &amp;quot;How are Parliaments Using New Media to Engage with Citizens?&amp;quot;, The Journal of Legislative Studies, vol. 18, 3/4 2012 (50% with J. Griffith).
? &amp;quot;Parliaments' endless pursuit of trust&amp;quot;, The Journal of Legislative Studies, vol. 18, 3/4 2012.
? &amp;quot;Towards a Trustee Model? Parliamentary Representation in the Internet Era&amp;quot; Parliamentary Affairs, vol. 65, 2, 2012.

The project has also already had an impact on the practitioners' community. The project encompassed a close engagement with practitioners, through the participation in practitioners' conferences and submission of evidence. Some of this involvement was at the invitation of practitioners. The project also enabled us closer involvement with specific policies and reports. Specifically, the project's findings had an impact onto an international organisation, which supports parliaments across the globe in maximizing the use of the Internet to facilitate engagement with the public. We also provided advice to specific parliaments focused on the challenges and care in using social media to communicate with the public. This advice impacted directly onto decisions regarding their use of social media.

We also participated in the ESRC Festival Social Sciences, by presenting a poster in the exhibition entitled 21st Century Lives: Local and Global Stories, exhibited at two different public galleries. The posters aimed to communicate our academic research to the wider public.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>BB1C9C53-91DF-40F1-B987-74D398931905</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>544e36385ea3b6.12690515</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The findings of the project encompass the following main themes: 

1. The identification of a set of combined characteristics that specifically define the institution of parliament and affect its ability to protect and control its image; namely, their high visibility, combined with public direct accountability and their collective nature make parliament a particularly vulnerable institution in terms of public image. Parliament's specific characteristics raise many challenges such as communicating and engaging with the public, whilst keeping a non-political approach. These challenges are aggravated within the internet environment, where the public expects a more explicit approach of engagement.

2. Institutional characteristics of parliaments (namely size, age, electoral system, governance remit) do not impact greatly on the public engagement activities, or specifically on the types of websites developed. The structural factors with an impact are the political actors' ability to influence the parliament's administrative decisions and the availability of resources. Those parliaments where political representatives have a more active say in administrative decisions, are more likely to push towards innovative approaches to public engagement, particularly in times of declining public trust. Unsurprisingly, those parliaments investing more resources to this area, are the ones able to develop more innovative and wide ranging public engagement activities. Whilst parliaments with fewer resources are able to produce considerably innovative sporadic outputs, they are unable to keep this in the longer term.

3. Public engagement has clearly developed as a new activity for parliaments within the last decade, to the point of becoming a new role of parliament adding on to the traditional ones of legislation, scrutiny and representation. What is more, the rise of the internet has been a determinant factor in the expansion of this role, due to the new means of communication it enables and its consequential pressures (in transparency and accessibility potential). This new role is expressed in the creation of new services and activities specifically focused on communication and public engagement, non-existent until recently. The level of expansion and professionalization of these services varies considerably and the project identifies the different elements contributing towards more professionalised public engagement, such as strategic planning. We also show, however, that levels of public trust on parliament are not necessarily higher in those cases where public engagement has become more professionalised.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This research has been disseminated with several parliaments.
