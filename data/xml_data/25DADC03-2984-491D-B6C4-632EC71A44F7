These range from laser pointers, focusing a tiny spot of light over large distances, to optical cables which replaced telegraph wires and revolutionized telecommunication industry by allowing data transmissions at incredible rates. The fundamental role in operation of any such device is played by waveguides - optical analogues of electric wires. The waveguides implement two major functions. They guide light along desired paths suppressing its natural tendency to spread and occupy all the available space. Also, by sustaining high local light intensity in the waveguide core, they trigger nonlinear response of the medium. The latter is vital to perform ultra-fast signal processing: from frequency conversion and pulse re-shaping to logical operations with signal carried by light. 

The present-day techniques of light guiding rely on the same principles that ensure beam focusing in an optical lens: the fact that light &amp;quot;prefers&amp;quot; to propagate in a dense medium rather than in a rarefied one. A thin wire made of a dense material, such as silica glass, surrounded, for example, by air makes a guiding structure for light. This technique, however, has the major limitation: the size of a waveguide core cannot be too small. The minimal scale here is dictated by the wavelength of light - of the order of micrometer. Being much thinner than a human hair, this is still not small enough to comply with demands of modern technology. For instance, if one is to replace all electronic components of a modern microprocessor by their optical analogues (aiming to boost the performance by a thousand times and beyond), the size of each element should be of the order of few tens of nanometers. Squeezing light this tight is a challenging task.

Promising candidates to replace conventional waveguides - are the so-called plasmonic waveguides, currently being developed in research labs. They represent few nanometers thick tiny metal inclusions in a transparent dielectric background, or, vice versa, narrow grooves/wedges on a metallic surface or holes in metal films. Light guiding in such composite metal/dielectric structures is done by virtue of exciting specific waves on a surface between a metal and a dielectric. Such waves couple photons with plasma oscillations inside the metal and are called 'plasmons'. Crucially, there is no limitation as to the minimal size of a plasmonic waveguide, indeed they localize and guide light at nanometer scale.

While the major guiding principles of plasmonic waveguides are well understood, little is known about different nonlinear processes with plasmons so far. The reason is that the state-of-the art theory is based on models, derived under the assumption that the material properties change on a scale comparable to or much larger than the light wavelength. Apparently, this is no longer true for plasmonic waveguide setups. It is the purpose of this research to develop appropriate theories and explore fundamentally new nonlinear processes associated with light propagation in composite nano-structures consisting of metals and dielectrics. Aiming to understand and explore novel physical effects, it will form the solid basis for future development of high performance, portable, tuneable, adaptive and reconfigurable optical devices.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research is exploratory and fundamental, rather than oriented towards specific applications. However, it is difficult to under-estimate the importance of a fundamental research. All the gained knowledge contributes towards education of future engineers, and ultimately towards economic and technological growth of our society. And the scope of potential applications of the developed theoretical tools and methods expands far beyond the range of setups and systems considered in this research proposal. Nonlinear and dispersive Maxwell equations form the basis of electromagnetism. Methods and tools of solving these equations are crucial for a variety of scientific and engineering applications. Moreover, the structure of models derived from Maxwell equations by using perturbation expansion techniques appears to be very general. And the corresponding tools and methods of solving and analysing these models, developed in the current project, can find their applications in many other areas of science and engineering outside optics and photonics.

Even though the planned research is of fundamental nature, it can pave the way for possible applications. Many systems, initially designed in academic laboratories to perform cutting-edge research, eventually find their applications in industries. In this respect, research in photonics has been very profitable so far, judging by the overwhelming amount of industrial applications that emerged during the relatively short-term life of this branch of science. These applications range from laser pointers to ultrahigh-speed communication devices and bio-chemical sensors that can detect presence of chemical substances in ultra-low concentrations. 

Being the subject of this research proposal, plasmonic waveguides represent a promising platform for on-chip integration of ultra-compact photonic components and development of next-generation nano-photonic devices. Nanophotonic circuits based on plasmonic waveguides can be potentially applied in many areas including telecommunications, healthcare, energy and security.

The proposed research aims to explore nonlinear pulse dynamics in plasmonic waveguides - the key component for operation of many photonic devices. Enabling nonlinear functionality in plasmonic circuits would dramatically expand their functionality and the range of potential applications, and will become a crucial step towards pushing photonics onto the whole new level of miniature light manipulation. Therefore the proposed research has a great potential to impact many existing and newly emerging industries. However exploitation of this research should proceed through close collaboration with experimental groups. Such collaborations will be the important part of this project.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-12-08</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-06-09</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>52573</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The research on this project has allowed a comprehensive theoretical analysis of plasmonic waveguides as the potential platform for light manipulation (including frequency conversion) at the nano-metre (deeply sub-wavelength) scale. 

It has been found, that the interplay between high attenuation (unavoidable in plasmonic structures) and high nonlinearity (via extreme light confinement) plays crucial role. One can define the &amp;quot;nonlinear figure of merit&amp;quot; as a simple measure to characterize the performance of a plasmonic waveguide: the ratio between the attenuation length (dictated by losses in the system) and a typical length required to perform frequency conversion. For efficient nonlinear processes, one would require this ratio as large as possible, but in any case to be larger than one. Among different configurations of plasmonic waveguides, the so-called dielectric loaded plasmonic waveguide - a dielectric nano-rib deposited on top of a metal surface - has been identified as the most promising platform. However, even for this configuration, the highest values of the nonlinear figure of merit was found to remain of the order of one at best.

Graphene was identified as an outstanding alternative to noble metals. Surface plasmons propagating along graphene has several advantages over the conventional analogues supported by metal/dielectric interfaces. In particular, it was found that the combination of much lower losses, higher field confinement, and stronger nonlinear material response of graphene, lead to the typical values of the nonlinear figure of merit to be of the order of few thousands and higher for graphene plasmonic waveguides.

This project has allowed to demonstrate theoretically the potential of graphene plasmonic waveguides for efficient light manipulation at extremely low powers and in small footprint devices. In particular, basic elements for all-optical switching were demonstrated. Also, a potential source of radiation in mid-IR regime (vital for many application) based on a sub-micrometer long waveguide has been demonstrated. 

The ideas developed through this project are now being put forward, in collaboration with several experimental groups, to carry further research in the direction of experimental verification and advancement of practical setups and basic logical elements of future plasmonic circuits.

One of the important achievements of this project is the development of a set of theoretical and computational tools for analysis of nonlinear optical effects in sub-wavelength geometries. These tools take into proper account strong variation of the guided mode field profiles with frequency of light, and also the specific surface-only nonlinear optical response of graphene. Potential area of applications of these tools extends far beyond the original scope of plasmonic structures, studied in this project. In particular, recently, in collaboration with researchers from the University of Bath, University Paris-Saclay, University of Lille and ITMO University, these tools has been applied for analysis of particularly strong dispersion of nonlinearity in micro-ring resonators, and their effect on frequency comb generation in such structures.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Development of next generation ultra-compact and energy efficient optical components is vital for many industries and applications, including IT (ultra-fast all-optical signal processing), security (sensing), healthcare (compact sources of mid-IR radiation). One of the main outcomes of this research project is theoretical predictions of functional photonic components based on graphene plasmonic waveguides. This is a major step towards advancement of compact and reconfigurable active plasmonic circuits, and functional photonic instruments to be integrated on a chip. To take this outcome further, the next important step would be to take forward these result and develop the corresponding experimental studies. All results of this research project are being communicated in the academic community via publications, conference talks and research visits.

Another important outcome of this project is the developed set of theoretical and computational tools for analysis of nonlinear optical effects in structures, characterized by appreciable variation of material properties on sub-wavelength (nano-metre) scale, and strong dispersion of field profiles. These tools can be of use not only to other academics, but also to engineers in the constantly growing sector of photonics. One of the corresponding routes of knowledge transfer is via established Career Progression Development courses, which are regularly organized in Bath. The newly developed theoretical tools are now included in the corresponding modelling section of the course.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5C24917D-5894-443A-8527-BB740B297275</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56bdbd96a0d0f7.43969946</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Energy,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>21743EAC-7580-4684-808B-9313F14EC6C6</gtr:id><gtr:title>Graphene Plasmonic Waveguides for Mid-Infrared Supercontinuum Generation on a Chip</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Photonics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a8b81b922db298fb1848c51b40771302"><gtr:id>a8b81b922db298fb1848c51b40771302</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gorbach A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56b911c19d2268.96774897</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>34C46ED4-0198-4C49-AE4A-9A786C56FD87</gtr:id><gtr:title>Nonlinear switching with a graphene coupler</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Physical Review B</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9b480d6fa6ccd1e1e414470d0ecff95b"><gtr:id>9b480d6fa6ccd1e1e414470d0ecff95b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Smirnova D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d050050a1584ad</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6B422C39-C81C-4FEF-A607-8B140250D1A2</gtr:id><gtr:title>Solitons and frequency combs in silica microring resonators: Interplay of the Raman and higher-order dispersion effects</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Physical Review A</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6d0dd2243d572e0c29c4b865c6b6425d"><gtr:id>6d0dd2243d572e0c29c4b865c6b6425d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mili?n C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5675eef07fec0</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/K009397/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
