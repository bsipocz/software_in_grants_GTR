It is based on the intuition that we should think of fundamental objects like electrons as being like little pieces of vibrating string, instead of the more traditional picture of little round balls or particles. Unfortunately the theory can only be made to work if we assume that the universe is ten-dimensional, and since we only observe four dimensions (three space plus time) physicists explain away the remaining six by assuming they are tightly curled up too small for us to see. If you only have one dimension to curl up then it's simple - you get a circle. If you have two dimensions however then there are lots of possibilities - a sphere and a torus (the surface of a ring doughnut) are two examples - and by the time you get to six dimensions it gets really complicated. This makes the physics very difficult, because you get different results depending on which particular six-dimensional space you choose to work with. This is where pure mathematics becomes useful, as mathematicians working over the past hundred years have developed lots of techniques for studying curved spaces in higher dimensions. Thus an important general goal is to take physical ideas and find mathematical tools (or if necessary, construct new ones) that correspond to them. This is very difficult, because string theory belongs to a branch of physics, called quantum field theory, which is still very poorly understood by mathematicians. However, in cases where it has been done it has proved amazingly useful, particularly to the mathematicians. This is because the physicists, using intuitions and calculations that mathematicians don't yet understand, can make predictions about the properties of these spaces that mathematicians would never have guessed. Many of these predictions have later been proved correct by other methods. The most interesting and impressive such tricks involve 'dualities', where the physics on two apparently unconnected spaces can be shown to be the same, which means that lots of deep mathematical properties of the spaces must also be the same. Sometimes one can even take the physics from one space and then change it continuously until it turns into the physics from another space, even though the two spaces are completely different and can't be continuously deformed into each other. My research is about the kind of strings which are 'open', which means they have end-points (as opposed to 'closed' strings which are loops). These end-points aren't allowed to roam freely in space, they have to stay on physical objects called 'branes'. When you consider all the branes in a space and all the strings between them (and then simplify things a bit) you get a mathematical object called a 'dg-category'. My aim is to understand examples of these dg-categories and the effects of the physical dualities that link them.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>217189</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>100000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Imperial College London</gtr:description><gtr:fundingOrg>Imperial College London</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>Junior Research Fellowship</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>537E8C4E-A62B-4A0A-B4B1-EB7FB6F376CD</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5ede114e5ede1162</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9C0AD8E5-29A9-436A-B515-E7633F8D5AEC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Equivalences Between GIT Quotients of Landau-Ginzburg B-Models</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Communications in Mathematical Physics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c8447e0844ba522093a283e201a1d312"><gtr:id>c8447e0844ba522093a283e201a1d312</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Segal E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cfd2fd270778df</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>CF9CC996-AE8B-4CFE-99DA-279BD5BC13EA</gtr:id><gtr:title>The closed state space of affine Landau-Ginzburg B-models</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Noncommutative Geometry</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c8447e0844ba522093a283e201a1d312"><gtr:id>c8447e0844ba522093a283e201a1d312</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Segal E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d0890895c30454</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/F043074/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>80</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>9C124926-5968-486F-9B51-CCEB6C4E9650</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Particle physics - theory</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>27F853CB-FB22-4B9D-82D7-542648D097F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>80</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Algebra &amp; Geometry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ABA2EC9F-6524-443A-BB92-7DF199FE4B25</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical Physics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
