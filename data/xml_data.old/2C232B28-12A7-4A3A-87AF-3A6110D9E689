However, copying others may not always result in optimum behaviour. If all individuals in a population copy those around them then no individual is sampling the environment and establishing whether another behaviour would be more productive; thus, copying alone produces a population which becomes 'stuck'. For behaviours to become more effective an individual must step outside the status quo and make a change to current practice; s/he must innovate.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This series of studies investigates changes in young children?s reliance on social learning and/or personal learning (innovation), using an artificial fruit paradigm in which children are presented with a puzzle box containing a reward, with some participants having witnessed a model extract the reward from the box, while others must attempt this with no demonstration. A multidimensional approach is taken, investigating the full context of the learning situation, including the characteristics a child brings to a task (eg age, gender, cognitive and social skills), the role of a model's characteristics (eg, their reported expertise, the number of models), and the role of contextual factors (eg, task difficulty, social pressure).&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The most obvious impact of this series of studies is scientific advancement across a number of sub-disciplines. Until now asocial learning and innovation have often been seen as an alternative to the fidelity seen in social learning; however, we propose to advance current understanding by establishing the dynamic processes that leads a child to choose between social learning, asocial learning and innovation. Such an investigation is of interest to researchers within this field, but also:
Anthropology, as the work explores some of the fundamental aspects of what makes us human, that is the acquisition, transmission and evolution of culture. By exploring differing levels of cooperation and competition (both across the nature of the task and the motivation of the individuals for limited resources, in an unstable environment) we can establish why we see different levels of innovation across societies (potential users: members of the AHRC Culture and Mind Project; Culture, Cognition &amp;amp; Coevolution Lab, University of British Columbia)
Animal Behaviour, Investigating the social learning and cultural evolution of young children and human adults provides an important counterpoint to current work exploring social learning strategy use in non-human animals. We know that although animals can learn both asocially and socially, innovation is relatively rare. Our proposed work offers some evidence to address why innovation is rare in the animal kingdom (potential users: Centre for Social Learning and Cultural Evolution, St Andrews; Living Links Center, Yerkes)
Linguistics, Our proposed work is analogous to research on language evolution that investigates the parameters of the acquisition, transmission and evolution of language. Here we present an alternative domain, that of 'artefact use', which allows parallels to be drawn about the conditions under which actions may change over generations (potential users: Language Evolution and Computation, Edinburgh; Department of Cognitive Biology, University of Vienna)
Developmental Psychology, Finally, an obvious impact will be made in the field of developmental psychology in areas interested in children's social learning, innovation, tool use, causal reasoning, conformity, overimitation, problem-solving and social affiliation (potential users, Max Plank Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig; Developmental Evolutionary Psychology Lab, Florida Atlantic University).
The work proposes a new collaboration between Prof Giraldeau and Dr Flynn, two internationally respected academics within the field of social learning and innovation, as evidenced by their CVs. Our proposal provides the opportunity to stand UK-funded research on the centre stage of an area of research of international and multidisciplinary interest. It also offers the opportunity to produce a highly skilled researcher, who will finish the grant with many transferable skills. 
The research also has societal and cultural impact, providing information about how individuals make their decisions, thus assisting in understanding maladaptive behaviour acquisition (e.g. smoking). We can also establish, and thus exploit, the best scenarios for knowledge and behaviour acquisition. For example, are children adept at deciding what their most effective learning strategy is across contexts, or is this dictated by other factors including, age, gender and/or task difficulty? By having a clearer understanding of determinants of social learning and innovation we can establish an environment in which we should see more creativity, in the form of innovation. Such an understanding, although focused on young children in this proposal, has the potential in the long term, to impact on areas as diverse as innovation in business and staff training in areas such as healthcare and education, and it is our aim to apply for follow-on funding to exploit these more applied research avenues.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-03-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-29</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>204159</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Innovation Workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7A63EAD2-96BD-4A60-B24E-969232E02CC5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>40 People attended a workshop on animal and human innovation.

We met this objective in a number of ways. Our first study investigated children's preferences for social learning versus asocial learning. The main finding from this is that 3- and 5-year-old children prefer to learn socially, but 5-year-old children who choose to learn asocially seem to show an advantage to learning in this style, even though it is more challenging (they need to work out for themselves how to do something rather than watching someone else). These findings were published as part of a themed issued on innovation and creativity, with contributions from a variety of academics from different disciplines. 
A second study examined children's likelihood of innovating depending on the characteristics of the model they had witnessed. The results of the original study were surprising so we ran two further studies to establish the mechanisms underpinning the behaviour we were witnessing. We discovered that five-year-olds were more likely to ask to learn socially when presented with a novel task, after witnessing an unreliable rather than a reliable model, there was no difference for three-year-olds (Experiment One). Experiment Two showed five-year-olds select a new model, over a previously unreliable model. Experiment Three replicated five-year-olds' learning preference in Experiment One in a new task, and showed children's attention is drawn towards other sources of social information (the experimenter) when viewing an unreliable model. A further critical finding addressed the procedure of current 'trust' paradigms in which children are forced to choose between two social sources of information and are never given the opportunity to learn for themselves (which may be their preference in some circumstances). This work has been submitted to Evolution and Human Behaviour. 
A third study examined how an adult consensus affects children's conformity across different judgment domain. Three- and five-year-olds' conformity was measured across three domains: (1) making a perceptual judgement, (2) matching the groups' preference for a reward, and (3) matching an arbitrary preference of the group. Where previous research had focused on the amount of conformity shown at different ages, our results demonstrate that the domain of conformity importantly interacts with age. This study is being prepared for publication. 
Our second and third objectives related to the interplay between competition and cooperation in social learning and innovation and to how environmental uncertainty, that is a lack of clarity about the efficacy of a previously successful action and the level of a resulting reward, affects the role of cooperation and competition on social learning and innovation. Our final study project addressed these questions. It was the most complex, and involved open diffusion work which is complex to code. We tested 96 children and have finished coding the data, and are in the process of analysing the data. It will be prepared for publication soon.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>It is too early to say what impact our work has outside academia.
