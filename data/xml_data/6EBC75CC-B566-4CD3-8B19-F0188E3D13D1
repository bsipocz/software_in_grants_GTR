- Work to develop ideas and basic concepts of modules and attachment systems into concept design in 3D CAD formats.

- Lead the 'Design for Manufacture' activities which will include the mechanical, fluid handling, and electrical systems as integral systems within 'Active' modules and 'Fixed Mass' modules.

- Carry out a detailed literature survey into the control and monitoring of subsea equipment including specific aspects of buoyancy control, orientation and connection conditions control.

- Support and inform the AFRC (University of Strathclyde) modelling simulations to select suitable materials for enhanced strength, durability and cost performance.

- Work with NAOME (University of Strathclyde), Frontier Technical and AFRC to install suitable instrumentation into Wave Tank test models.

- Attend weekly telecalls and quarterly consortium participant meetings. Plans will be refined and adjusted if necessary as the results of the research and testing develops.

- Build scale models for tank test. 

- Provide materials selection and associated environmental impact studies.

- Support AFRC in developing load distribution concepts for the mounting of a 5MW NREL 'standard wind turbine' onto the floating structure and practical 'manufacturable' design.
 
- Provide input to support the design and build of a 4 quarter scale fully functioning models for demonstration in the Port of Sunderland Docks and in the open sea.

- Conduct appropriate mechanical tests on representative samples to provide data for subsequent modelling.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The outputs from the project will enable the partners to assess the viability of a new floating platform concept for wind turbines. Full annual production in 2025, based upon a market penetration of 15% into deep water wind market, could reach 27000 modules, equivalent to 270 5MW floating platforms representing an annual increase of 1.35GW installed capacity. A profit margin of 25% could result in up to &amp;pound;250M profit per annum. 
 
Global perspective
It is acknowledged and reflected in the UN/ BEIS policies, that the dependence on fossil fuels for power generation worldwide is unsustainable. More must be done to enable power from renewable energy sources to replace fossil fuels in our energy mix. This is a challenge for developed countries, even those which benefit by a subsidised renewables market. The deployment cost of any renewable energy solution must be reduced to make it a more cost effective option. If these can be reduced there is the potential for a step change in adoption. This project is aiming simultaneously to contribute to solutions for all of the issues of the Energy Trilemma and the reduction in deployment costs of renewable energy assets to meet the energy generation needs of developing countries, thereby contributing to the sustainable development both in the UK and in the developing world.

Economic
The project is expected to have a significant economic impact in the following areas. Inside the consortium the project will form a basis for Frontier Technical's economic activity with a prospect of becoming a significant revenue generator and employer. Further it will allow the industrial partners to diversify into the marine structure industry and allow growth of business for those companies in this sector. Outside the consortium the project will engage with suppliers in the supply chain and contribute to economic growth in North East. Finally, in the developing countries market, the technology could transform the economic fortunes of coastal area.

Social
The social impacts of this project in the UK lie mainly within the international and national commitments to reducing greenhouse gas emissions to limit the impact of climate change, and thereby safeguard society. This work could directly contribute to DBEIS policy on climate change mitigation and industrial strategy and the Defra policy on climate change adaptation. For developing countries, access to clean, affordable and reliable energy underpins all other policy development to reduce social deprivation and improve the standard of living (ref: DFID 'Transforming Energy Access' initiative). Currently this energy access is severely limited by the cost of deployment and infrastructure requirements that are often either unavailable or prohibitive to develop. Unlocking this market could underpin significant social improvement in countries that need it most. It is anticipated also that social benefits will come through the impact on regional employment and prosperity in the North East. Skills and knowledge, leading to more and better jobs in the region, will help regeneration.

Environmental 
The environmental impacts of this project contribute to international and national commitments to reducing greenhouse gas emissions to limit the impact of climate change. The project will reduce the manufacturing carbon footprint of traditional fixed floating wind construction and use green technologies wherever possible. The proposed technology is highly amenable to recycling and re-use and /or alternative use of the modular units. Longer term benefits could also include green energy for aquaculture.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>50525</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P032958/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F95121C7-7C31-40CE-BDBC-1E2BF025AEA6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Energy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6BCCE8AB-CBA5-4D28-9682-5236FE9D0668</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Energy - Marine &amp; Hydropower</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
