It spans most of the culture, but with until our introduction of the Physics Pavilion in 2016 and the exception of environmental talks, it generally lacked science. 
The initial aim of last year's pilot was to lead to a fuller engagement from CERN in 2017 and onward; this has met with success. The second aim was to spread the idea to the sister festivals around the world. This is proceeding; we are leadingan active discussion of partner Physics Pavilions in WOMAD Adelaide and WOMAD Auckland. Discussions with WOMAD Chile are in a more embryonic stage.

After a highly successful initial Pavilion in 2016, we have been asked to return 'bigger and better' for at least two more years. The total footfall in 2016 over 3 days was ~4000, larger than the tent capacity allowed because for some sessions we removed the side of the tent for more people to participate. Only three one-hour sessions were below full capacity, and then only just. For the next events, the two previous aims remain.

The overall aims are to engage a broad family audience with the ideas behind STFC science and physics in general; to excite them with the possibilities and concepts; and to offer smaller groups to join in activities illustrating the science and technologies.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The presence of Physics@WOMAD will be advertised through the event itself, on its website and through its promotional material. The success of the event is being monitored by CERN with a view to supporting the full CERN@WOMAD proposal in 2017. The IoP will also be monitoring the event. We will report on the successes and failures to assist other possible science engagement with cultural festivals. (Glastonbury and Latitude might be obvious targets; WOMAD was chosen because of contact with the organizers, one of which was a physicist by degree and an IoP member, and who visited ATLAS.)
The output will be in education and engagement, and so not produce direct reusable output. We are attempting to make use of pre-existing material for the talks, so no new items are being created. The content and formats developed for this festival can be reused for other such festivals worldwide.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>6400</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/R001596/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
