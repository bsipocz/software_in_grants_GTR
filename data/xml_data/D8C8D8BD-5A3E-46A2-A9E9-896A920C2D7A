The Road Safety Act 2006 created two new causing death by driving offences: causing death by careless driving and causing death by driving whilst uninsured, unlicensed or disqualified. These offences are interesting and controversial because, to use a phrase adopted by criminal law theorists, they are 'constructive' in nature: all that is needed to prove the offence is that the driver committed the underlying offence (careless driving or driving whilst uninsured etc.) and in doing so caused the death of another person; no additional blameworthy state of mind, such as foresight of a risk of death, is required. Traditionally there has been some opposition to constructive crimes, particularly amongst legal academics, since the harm caused may be fairly remote from the blameworthiness of the offender in committing the underlying offence. The effect of such offences, however, is three-fold. Firstly they attach a more stigmatic label to the offender: as a 'causer of death'. Secondly, the lack of a requirement to prove blameworthiness in relation to the harm caused means that such offences are much easier to prove than 'conventional' offences that require mens rea. Thirdly, they provide the courts with far more severe sentencing powers: escalating from a period of disqualification from driving coupled with a fine (under the old law) to up to five years' imprisonment (under the new). The main objective of the study is to explore the impact that these new offences have had on the investigation and prosecution of road death incidents by the police and Crown Prosecutors subsequent to such investigation and examine the impact of law reform on the 'law in action'. \nThe study will be empirical in nature. It builds on an earlier study of criminal charges resulting from fatal collisions conducted prior to the enactment of the 2006 Act, and so provides a unique point of comparison for how legal changes have (or have not) affected the practices of the criminal justice agencies. It will involve access to police and CPS files relating to road traffic collisions, in order to collect data on: the number of cases in which a decision was taken not to prosecute; the charges brought in any case going to court and the outcome (including plea and sentence).\nMy earlier study brought me to a number of conclusions about the unique nature of prosecutions in case of RDIs and the desirability of introducing a new causing death by careless driving offence (please see my attached list of publications). Whilst there are theoretical reasons to object to a new causing death by driving offence, there may be both negative and positive effects to it in practice, and these knock-on effects warrant exploration. In creating the new offences the Government seems not to have considered the impact such a change could have on issues such as the likelihood of a suspect to plead guilty or of the CPS to accept a plea to a lesser offence. Whilst my previous study found that there was a 'grey' area between the offence of careless driving and causing death by dangerous driving, it also found that the police and CPS were more often than not in agreement as to which offence to charge. What the new law has not done is to clarify the distinction between careless and dangerous driving; prosecutors will still be left with a difficult decision, only now they may be less reluctant to charge the lesser of the two offences, knowing that there is the potential for a custodial sentence.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Beneficiaries of the project:\n-Academic researchers\n-Stakeholders within the criminal justice system: police; CPS; defence lawyers; judges and magistrates\n-Policy-makers within government and criminal justice agencies (who may wish to monitor the impact of law reforms and make refinements or revisions to policy guidance in light of the evidence base provided by my empirical findings).\n- Charities such as the Parliamentary Advisory Committee for Traffic Safety and RoadPeace\n-The public\nWhile much is written on the criminal law from a theoretical perspective, there is little empirical work available on how the law operates in practice in relation to serious offences. The findings of my study will provide some key comparisons for seeing what works best in terms of investigating and prosecuting offences arising from fatal collisions. Practitioners are likely to be interested in examples of 'best practice'. It is surprising how little audit work is done by criminal justice agencies in relation to the work they undertake; this will supply a joined-up approach to thinking about their work. It will provide a useful supplement to HM CPS Inspectorate, which reviews the work of the CPS but, with the exception of joint inspections with HM Inspectorate of Constabulary, typically does not look in any depth at how the police influences what prosecutors do.\nWhen the RSA 2006 was enacted, the government argued that new offences were needed to close the gap between the penalties for careless driving and causing death by dangerous driving. Victim support groups calling for tougher penalties for drivers who kill were cited in support of the proposals. What is not clear from news reports since the coming into force of the new law is whether victims are satisfied with the sentences drivers now receive, or whether they continue to feel that sentences are derisory. Given that the new causing death by careless driving offence only provides a maximum of five years' imprisonment, the sentencing guidelines suggest that a custodial sentence is far from guaranteed. This may leave victims in the same position as previously, with little achieved. There is potential for the new law to have the reverse effect, given that prosecutors may feel justified in opting for the lesser offence rather than fighting for a causing death by dangerous driving charge in cases of intermediate severity, and adopt a strategy - whether consciously or subconsciously - of 'driving deviance down' (Garland, 'The Limits of the Sovereign State' (1996) 36 Brit. J. Criminol. 445-471). The degree to which this occurs is not discernible from official data and may be useful in developing policy in this area further. Similarly, those who campaign for changes in law and policy may benefit from evidence on which to base their arguments, or to amend their view if appropriate. \nI will be providing the CPS and each of the police forces involved in my study with reports on my findings. I will also organise a workshop at the University of Leicester to which interested parties will be invited, including representatives from the police, CPS, other stakeholders within the criminal justice system (e.g. HM CPS Inspectorate), academics, and other interested parties such as road safety charities. This will allow me to disseminate my findings whilst at the same time validating them by receiving instant feedback from those involved.\nGiven that virtually all members of the public use the roads, whether as pedestrians, cyclists or drivers, they have a stake in the way in which such offences are dealt with. There appears to have been a shift in approach in media reports on road death and the results of my research will undoubtedly be of interest to broadsheet newspapers, who will be able to communicate the major findings to the public at large.\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>74800</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>I have been involved in events organised by two campaign/victims groups, RoadPeace and CTC, as an expert able to comment on the prosecution of causing death by driving offences.
