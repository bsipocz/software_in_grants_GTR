The aim outlined in the original funding application, of encouraging people to 'engage with their own preconceptions and...test and question their origins', has remained central to the ethos of the centre. The centre is, and will remain, firmly rooted in its internationally-recognised research into the history of the conflict and its legacy. Gateways will continue to offer this resource to all centres and, specifically, will offer leadership in particular themes:

The memory of the First World War
Life on the Home and Fighting Fronts
The medical history of the First World War
Propaganda and persuasion
Maritime and naval history
Operational and military history. 

The centre has developed a programme of high-quality events, organised in a variety of locations, which have involved sharing the latest academic research on the First World War to enrich and inspire existing and developing projects, workshops and training, showcasing of HLF projects and networking opportunities. As planned in the original application for funding, collaborations with non-HEI bodies has been a key element of the Gateways project and the centre has established and extended strong partnerships with a range of organisations including the Imperial War Museums, First World War Centenary Partnership, Commonwealth War Graves Commission and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. Significant activities are underway to support these organisations, particularly for the Somme 100 commemorations, and will continue over the next two years. The centre has established UK-wide reach through its travelling exhibitions, events (including a successful community Roadshow) and academic and community collaborations in a number of regions, including Scotland.

Gateways will build its role around a rich programme of events for 2017-2019, which has been very much shaped by careful analysis of feedback on activities carried out 2014-2016 and conversations with partner organisations and its sister centres.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Gateways to the First World War will continue to make a considerable impact based on its core overarching aims:

That the British public is given the opportunity to engage with, understand and interpret a historical event that played a fundamental role in the shaping of the contemporary world and their place within it. In exploring the local, wherever located, they will engage with the global. They will also engage with their own preconceptions and be encouraged to test and question their origins. Gateways will then use this as a base to examine the (dis)connection between academic/official history and popular perceptions.

It will use a broad range of platforms and partnerships to ensure that its events and resources are disseminated and achieve a high profile including a purpose-built website, use of social media. Based on its initial experiences, it has produced a refined programme of events designed to meet the needs of local communities, groups and organisations. This will provide a wide-range of people with the skills and confidence to engage with academic research according to their own interests, develop new partnerships and community links, establish an even closer working relationship with the HLF, and inspire a lasting legacy.

The Third Sector
Gateways will enhance relationships with existing partners still further and pioneer new links. It will demonstrate fully that both HEIs and the third sector can interact fruitfully to mutual benefit which then also enhances the lives of the wider public. Examples of existing partnerships include: Museums, galleries and archives: Brighton Pavilion and Museums, Chatham Dockyard Museum, Cognitive Media, Kent County Council Archives, Libraries and Museums, Maidstone Museum, National Maritime Museum, Portsmouth City Museums, Royal Engineers Museum, Library, Screen South. Of great interest is the ability to interact with the In Flanders Field Museum, Ieper/Ypres due to the research overlaps enhanced by geographical proximity which will mean an Impact beyond the UK. Key First World War-interest groups and organisations: War Memorials Trust, Western Front Association. The initial mechanism for harnessing the links will be the series of public engagement open days and follow-up events planned by Gateways. These will pave the way for further collaborative involvement in Connected Communities and Translating Cultures research applications particularly designed to investigate reactions to the centenary events and ensure comparative studies beyond the UK.

The media
Gateways members are continue to engage with the media on the First World War centenary at a local, national and international level. Three network members took part in the AHRC-BBC national seminar and network members are still supporting the BBC First World War at Home team. The communications offices of all Gateways institutions are aware of the significance of the anniversary and are committed to ensuring that the research expertise of its members is highlighted.

Policy-makers, governments and public sector agencies
The Centre will provide a flagship case study for the UK government and public sector agencies on large-scale academic-community involvement which can be drawn upon to inform approaches to similar high-profile events such as the forthcoming Second World War (80th) anniversary cycle. Gateways has delivered on its original objective of making close contact with the Department of Culture, Media and Sport and is now an active collaborator, and in particular is playing a significant role in the forthcoming Somme 100 activities in Heaton Park, Manchester. It is also working closely with the Commonwealth War Graves Commission on its 'Commemorating 114 Days' project related to the Somme centenary. Gateways sees this relationship developing further in Phase 2 with particular emphasis on the Third Ypres and Armistice observations of 2017 and 2018.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>470501</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/P006655/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DCE73056-5E3D-4976-B573-234E5FF4D633</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic &amp; Social History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E5E4CBFA-1AC0-405D-A6EC-46A5C0B6704F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History of Sci./Med./Technol.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>319D6F57-4306-40E8-9F0A-84D514AAF7FC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Imperial/Colonial History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DF8321C4-0BDE-4E78-8A6D-3F3FA99A9138</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>War Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
