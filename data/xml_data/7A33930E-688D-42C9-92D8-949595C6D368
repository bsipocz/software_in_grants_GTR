Innate immunity provides a first line of defence during the critical period just after a host has been exposed to a microbe and functions, firstly, to slow the progress of the infection while the adaptive response ?gets going?, and secondly, to help the expansion of the adaptive immunity. Innate immune cells recognise infection and cancer using receptors that distinguish alterations on the typical structures present on healthy cells, and can detect molecules from microbes, and foreign or aberrant molecules generated as a consequence of a particular disease. From this ?immunological? point of view, cancer cells can be viewed as altered self-cells that have escaped normal growth-regulating mechanisms. As a consequence of their transformation, tumour cells express altered cellular proteins (tumour antigens), some of which could be recognised by receptors of either the adaptive or the innate immune system. This is the case of MIC and ULBP molecules, two families of proteins expressed on the cell surface of a few cell types, such as gut epithelium, that are induced in stressed cells, for example as a consequence of a viral infection or a tumoral transformation. These proteins are an example of link between the adaptive and the innate immune response, as they engage with an activating receptor, called NKG2D, present in cells from both arms of the immune system. The recognition of MIC or ULBP on the surface of a cell is understood as a marker for ?unhealthy? or ?stressed? cell by NKG2D and leads to its killing. However, some MIC and ULBP molecules can be shed by tumours into the serum of patients where they seem to prevent activation of immune system cells. Further, some viruses have evolved mechanisms to block the expression of MIC and ULBP proteins at the surface of the infected cell, avoiding the killing of the cell and thus allowing the dissemination of the virus.
The mechanisms underlying surface expression and shedding of NKG2D-binding proteins are not completely understood. Study of these processes could thus help to understand evasion of the immune system by certain viruses and tumours and to design new strategies to fight against the disease from its origin.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>NKG2D is a C-type lectin-like receptor able to activate cytotoxicity by immune effector cells such as T cells and NK cells. Engagement of NKG2D with its ligands (NKG2D-L) is, thus, a crucial step in the regulation of both innate and antigen-specific immune responses, and plays a major role in cytotoxicity against virus-infected and tumour cells. In general, NKG2D-L are not present at the surface of normal cells, instead, they are upregulated in cells under stress. For example, NKG2D-L are expressed on cells that are treated with DNA-damaging agents and in many types of tumours. NKG2D-L can also be released to the extracellular surroundings and they have been found in sera from leukaemia patients. Several studies suggest the existence of a fine regulation of the expression of NKG2D-L, at transcriptional, post-transcriptional and post-translational levels. However, the precise mechanisms controlling the upregulation and shedding of these molecules are unknown. This application will focus on the biochemical characterization and analysis of the intracellular trafficking of one of the two families of NKG2D-L: the UL16-binding proteins (ULBPs), MHC (Major Histocompatibility Complex) Class I related proteins anchored to the membrane through a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) moiety. While one member of this family has been reported to localise to lipid-rafts, the organisation of other ULBPs in the plasma membrane has not been studied and little is known about the cellular trafficking of any of these molecules. Thus, this project proposes to investigate the factors regulating cell surface expression and release of these molecules. A detailed comparison of the Cell Biology of the ULBPs in healthy and distressed cells, could help to understand the mechanism that leads to the appearance of ULBP at the plasma membrane with subsequent activation of cytotoxicity towards that cell. The applicant has already set up the techniques necessary for the development of this research and used them in another project studying the mechanism of a viral evasion protein that interferes with the upregulation of NKG2D-L. The strength of this proposal consists in the use of established Cell Biology techniques to increase understanding of a process whose regulation remains elusive and to try to integrate these data with the function of molecules that are of crucial importance for the immune system. This research would be conducted at the University of Cambridge, where there is considerable expertise in the fields of Immunology and Cell Biology.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder
