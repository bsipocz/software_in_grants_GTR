Narrative commentaries represent an increasingly significant component of financial communications. While financial narratives in the UK are shaped in part by prevailing regulations, senior management enjoys significant discretion over the content, structure and presentation of these disclosures. The informativeness of financial narrative disclosures and the way management apply their reporting discretion are key questions for academics and policymakers. 

Partnering with the UK body responsible for promoting high quality corporate governance and financial reporting - the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) - this interdisciplinary project will combine expertise from accounting with state-of-the-art methods from computational linguistics to examine two key elements of financial disclosure. The first aspect is preliminary earnings announcements (PEAs), which arguably represent the most important disclosure in UK firms' annual reporting calendar. The second aspect is the annual report to shareholders, which forms the largest single recurring disclosure commitment for management.

Two opposing perspectives exist on corporate narrative disclosures. On the one hand, proponents argue that narratives provide information beyond that contained in financial data. On the other hand, opponents claim that management exploit the discretion embedded in narrative reporting to obfuscate or present a biased representation of actual performance. While extant work on UK annual report and PEA narrative disclosures provides evidence consistent with both perspectives, both the scope of the research and the generalizeability of findings is compromised because conclusions rely on manual coding methods applied to small samples.

This project will develop and use state-of-the-art computerized textual analysis methods to study the properties and usefulness of financial narratives for a comprehensive sample of UK disclosures published between 2003 and 2016. While researchers are already using these methods to study disclosures made by US companies, problems accessing digital PEAs and annual reports coupled with inconsistent document structure has hindered computerized analysis of UK financial narratives and skewed research agendas away from studying UK reporting outcomes. This project will shine much needed light on two key aspects of UK narrative reporting. The work will provide the first large sample analysis of PEAs narratives. 

The project will also examine a set of contemporary policy-relevant themes relating to the content and structure of UK annual reports. Software tools and datasets from the project will also create new opportunities for the research community.

Policymakers are facing pressure to adopt evidenced-based approaches to regulation. While the FRC is committed to conducting impact and evaluation analyses, it is reliant on a relatively small team of research staff to undertake such work, much of which involves manual collection and analysis of unstructured data. The labour-intensive nature of the work inevitably yields results that are hard to generalize and constrains the scope of the FRC's work. As well as examining novel and policy-relevant research questions, this project will embed computerized text analytics methods in the FRC's formal policymaking processes. The methods will complement existing approaches by facilitating lower cost and more comprehensive assessments of regulatory changes and emerging issues in narrative reporting.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from the work?
The project will deliver economic and societal benefits as well as contributing to academic research.

The work involves co-funded and co-produced research with the UK financial reporting regulator, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC). The work seeks to enhance policymaking in corporate governance and financial reporting by: reviewing a key unregulated aspect of corporate reporting in the form of preliminary earnings announcements (PEAs) to determine the need or otherwise for regulatory guidance; evaluating the impact of recent developments in annual report narratives; and embedding large-sample textual analysis methods in the FRC's policymaking toolkit.

Other bodies with links to financial reporting are also expected to benefit from project outputs including the UK Investor Relations Society (UK IRS) and the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW), the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG), and the International Integrated Reporting Council (IRRC).

The academic community will also benefit from the project. Large-sample empirical research on corporate narratives is skewed heavily toward the US due in part to the ease with which financial narratives can be accessed and processed automatically in that market. This project will create new resources, insights, and agendas for researchers generally and UK researchers in particular.

What form will the benefits take?
The research will enhance policymaking through two ex ante impact assessments of prevailing financial reporting practice. First, we will undertake the first systematic analysis of the properties and economic impact of PEA commentaries as a basis for evaluating the need or otherwise for the FRC to issue regulatory guidance. (PEAs are largely unregulated in the UK, creating variation in practice and scope for both informative reporting and obfuscation.) Second, we will provide large-sample evidence on emerging trends in unregulated aspects of annual report narratives as a basis for identifying both best practice and areas where regulatory guidance may be required. We also expect these findings to be of interest to other bodies involved in financial reporting including UK IRS, ICAEW, EFRAG and IIRC.

The project will also contribute to FRC policymaking activities by providing comprehensive post-implementation reviews of recent developments in annual reporting. (The FRC is currently restricted to conducting small sample manual post-implementation reviews that are costly to produce and hard to generalise.)

Coincident with this instrumental impact, the project will also deliver capacity-building impact to policymaker and academic communities. For the policymaker community, the work will embed large sample textual analysis and big data methods in the FRC's policy toolkit, empowering it to conduct comprehensive, timely, and low cost analyses of UK firms' narrative reporting practices as part of its surveillance and post-implementation review activities (where only small sample manual work is currently possible). Training and documentation to support software and methods will enable FRC colleagues to harness the potential of these resources and ensure significant legacy benefits. Datasets of financial narratives will also enhance contemporaneous and future evidence-based policymaking activities.

For the academic community, the project will build sustainable UK-focused research capacity by: developing software resources that facilitate automatic retrieval and analysis of corporate financial narratives; providing new training opportunities in textual analysis for researchers; generating datasets summarizing the properties of narrative commentaries; and stimulating UK-focused research agendas in hitherto unexplored areas such as document structure, content integration, and data presentation.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>424390</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/R003904/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
