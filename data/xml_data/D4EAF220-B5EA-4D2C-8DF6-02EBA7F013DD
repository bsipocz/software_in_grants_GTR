Currently, self-build projects account for 14% of the new homes built, a percentage equivalent to or greater than that of any single house building firm. This form of housing provision is, however, understudied, with the result that there is very little understanding of who the people are who choose to build their homes, the motivations for this residential practice and experiences of self-building. This project aims to correct this lacuna of knowledge, conducting a systematic enquiry into self-building in Britain, taking seriously the need to know who is using self-build, what their characteristics are and to what extent they succeed in their aims, as well as exploring how the self-build market is structured. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project will be conducted over three years, and is comprised of several different modes of data collection and analysis, engaging self-build households, potential self-builders, industry professionals and experts, national and local planning authorities. This will be supplemented with a review of planning and housing policies, and analysis of popular representations of self-build in Britain. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research project draws on expertise from an advisory group throughout the process from research design to dissemination, demonstrating a commitment to the production of research data that is of interest and use to non-academics. Overall the findings of this research will be of significant interest to people interested in the future of self-build housing and housing provision in Britain. Interested parties will include, but will not be limited to:
(1) The Department for Communities and Local Government
(2) Local planning authorities
(3) Thinktanks working on housing policies and futures
(4) Self-build organisations such as the National Self-Build Association (NaSBA) and other local self-build associations such as the Bath and District Self-build Association
(5) The National Self-Build and Renovation Centre (Swindon) 
(6) Independent Community Interest Companies interested in self-build
(7) Media outlets including Homebuilding and Renovation Magazine, Self-build and Design, Grand Designs, Build it and Home Improvement Magazine
(8) Practitioners including architectural firms, self-build consultancies, financial service providers and contractors
The research has clear relevance for these parties because of their existing investments in self-build. In the case of the government, this interest is made apparent in their support self-build as an alternative housing strategy and the provision for this, through the Custom Homes Programme in the 2011 Housing Strategy. In respect to beneficiaries 1-6, the research will aid in the ongoing assessment of self-build housing in Britain, address its future and inform policy and other interventions in the field of housing. The research will also be of benefit to self-builders themselves, providing thorough information about the process of self-building and using findings to provide some practical advice on this process and could help to change the public opinion of self-build through the dissemination of findings stressing the diverse routes into this form of housing provision and the various motivations of those involved. 

As detailed in the Pathway to Impact attachment, findings will be disseminated to these non-academic respondents through various channels including a one-day workshop, and 15-page research report. It is anticipated that this will form the basis of a consultation document for the NaSBA and Department for Communities and Local Government to provide an evidence-base for discussions over the future of self-build, an issue pertinent to the Government's housing strategy. In this respect, it is anticipated that the results of this research will have an impact beyond the academy. 

The research findings will be further disseminated to the general public and participants through a project website, the exhibition of research findings (plus visual data and artefacts) at the Homebuilding and Renovation show, seminars at the Homebuilding and Renovation Show, a consultation document for potential self-builders, and articles in magazines and other media outlets. In this manner, the research findings will be used to extend understandings of the self-build population, investments in the process, and the overall experience of the project of building your own home. Academic dissemination will also be communicated to the general public through the use of press releases as and when appropriate, and listed on the project website.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>140344</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>British Sociological Association Conference</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0A6E864C-1838-4F95-A9D4-0C727B51D8AD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Over 100 PGR students attended my presentation at the British Sociological Association PG Research Forum in April 2016.

The findings of these stages of the research demonstrated that there is currently considerable energy from the housing and urban development industry as well as the government into promoting and supporting ways for people to have access to self building in England. However, this access remains constrained by wider issues related to how the housing and land markets function, the culture of housing in England, and the financial and legal structures of housing. The survey demonstrated that at present only particular portions of the population can easily access forms of self build, with the result that this is more common among people who have considerable housing assets already, and who are often retired.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>I believe that there are findings and recommendations within the report on these findings that could be taken forward and used by others. They could, for example, be used as a basis for discussing what changes could be brought into force to make housing more accessible. I am also in regular contact with NaCSBA (National Custom and Self Build Association), and am currently part of a working group relating to this body, where I am able to provide advice on the basis of my research. This association has a dual function, both in terms of lobbying the government and as a trade association. I have been in communication with them about how these findings might be used by them, and will be continuing the conversation over the remainder of the project. My ambition is that within future discussions of housing policy, particularly as these relate to supporting self building in England (for example there is a current bill going through parliament on precisely this topic), that my research can feed into and inform these.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>86CBCF43-A9FC-4482-BBF3-9F6DC21DF7B0</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544fda1394af53.58337664</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.gold.ac.uk/sociology/research/researchprojects/self-building/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>DFD36106-C873-4918-B8CF-B903A7486823</gtr:id><gtr:title>Self-build homes: social rationales, lived experiences and new directions</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7a1f92e6945ff5e5bcfcd59ba9ab736e"><gtr:id>7a1f92e6945ff5e5bcfcd59ba9ab736e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>M C Benson</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c6c095c44481.38919449</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1039CCE1-BBDC-4C84-94D1-9E391B14161D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Self-build homes: social rationales, lived experiences and new directions</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5d4b875956da2e9be3b7172c3e3b73e3"><gtr:id>5d4b875956da2e9be3b7172c3e3b73e3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames> M C Benson</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c6bf6f810046.69033071</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1E783FAF-FF46-4D5F-AB43-E6ADCE4AEA2D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Self-build homes: social rationales, lived experiences and new directions</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7a1f92e6945ff5e5bcfcd59ba9ab736e"><gtr:id>7a1f92e6945ff5e5bcfcd59ba9ab736e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>M C Benson</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c6c03493a5b0.87954913</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A5E1E244-DFD1-4E66-A14F-44C6ACF18EDE</gtr:id><gtr:title>Self-build homes: social rationales, lived experiences and new directions</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ddedb01a6dfb2f054c2e8d37674fc30b"><gtr:id>ddedb01a6dfb2f054c2e8d37674fc30b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>I Hamiduddin</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c6c0f9996522.80655855</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/K001078/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:parents><gtr:parent><gtr:id>D4EAF220-B5EA-4D2C-8DF6-02EBA7F013DD</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>ES/K001078/1</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>140344.56</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2013-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:children><gtr:child rel="Transfer"><gtr:id>75336CF0-36E9-4E12-95BD-8AF37F869264</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>ES/K001078/2</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>101046.4</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2013-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2015-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:children/></gtr:child></gtr:children></gtr:parent></gtr:parents></gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>B57EEFB7-602E-4F5D-92E4-A0C265266249</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Demography &amp; human geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>020361E1-B8CA-49FD-9149-27D31D21C7A3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>020361E1-B8CA-49FD-9149-27D31D21C7A3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
