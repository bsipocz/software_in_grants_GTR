At these extreme temperatures, laboratory experiments have shown that these cold atoms can be used as ultra-sensitive sensors for measuring gravity. The objective of this project is to take the technology out of the laboratory and build it into a small satellite payload that is capable of producing cold atoms in space. Demonstrating this new technology in space is a vital first step towards realising real instruments that are capable of mapping tiny changes in the strength of gravity across the surface of the earth. The extreme sensitivity brought by cold atom sensors will provide the ability to finely monitor the movement of mass within earth systems. This has multiple applications including accurate monitoring of changes in polar ice mass, ocean currents and sea level. Higher resolution data will lead to the ability to monitor smaller water sources and new underground natural resources which are currently not detectable. Similar technology will also be used for deep space navigation and for providing higher precision timing sources in space.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The economic benefits arising from CASPA are an expected increase in UK turnover of several &amp;pound;million in 3-5 years based on new component sales from the industrial partners in the project, plus potential for further VC investment and growth via the development of high-value space satellite systems. These benefits will spill-over to the quantum supply chain, which includes specialist materials, components, and system integrators across the UK. Quantum technologies are expected to grow to a $Billion market in 2020 with over 50% of the required expertise based in Europe.

Socially, additional turnover equates to new jobs in the UK, including engineers, technical, sales and admin staff. Investment in quantum technologies will enable the UK to maintain an important technology lead and train a new generation of engineers and physicists with sought-after high level skills. Engagement with industry will enable those engineers to find jobs relevant to their training, while engagement with UK policy makers Innovate UK, DSTL, and EPSRC will ensure government priorities remain focussed on funding initiatives in areas of UK-centric expertise.

The use of cold atom gravimeters in space is expected to lead to a significant improvement in the ability to monitor earth systems. This will improve the capability of detecting and predicting earthquakes and floods and will enable sea level rise to be monitored with improved resolution. The additional data these devices produce will inform scientific research and guide government policy. Additionally the advancement in payload capability that the 6U form factor unlocks will support a number of environmentally important applications; for example, smart-farming, fish stock monitoring, forest fire monitoring, ocean colour monitoring and increased connectivity in remote regions. All of these aspects will protect human life and lead to increased quality of life for people living in at risk areas.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>239369</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>37750634-CDE7-4359-A1CF-8184BBAB77A9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Ductile dicing of LiNbO3 ridge waveguide facets to achieve 0.29 nm surface roughness in single process step</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Electronics Letters</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f711e8c3bb4f3993ea48b4196244ab6e"><gtr:id>f711e8c3bb4f3993ea48b4196244ab6e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Carpenter L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a796e386334d6.81929827</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P034160/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
