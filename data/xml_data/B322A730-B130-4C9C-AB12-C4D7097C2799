Internet marketing has been invaluable for consumers who want specialist items and has reduced overheads for specialist producers and retailers. This has been especially important in clothes marketing, where consumers seeking non-standard items can now shop online to replace or augment the high street. For women seeking fashionable ways to dress modestly, like the growing numbers of Muslim women who obtain modest clothing over the web, the internet has been indispensible. Other faith groups that have dress requirements show similar developments in the commercial production and distribution of clothing: observant and orthodox Jews, and some Christian groups like the Church of the Latter-day Saints (Mormons). In most cases, internet marketing allows brands to reach beyond their immediate location, serving consumers internationally. The markets for modest clothing aimed at, produced by, particular faith groups have expanded to create ranges for women of different income brackets, ages, occupations and taste. Women are now far more likely to be able to dress in line with their sense of piety but still in fashion.\n\nAIM 1: To discover if the expansion and diversification through e-commerce of clothes for women who are religiously motivated to dress modestly has allowed the emergence of a new category of 'modest fashion' that has the potential to transcend specific religions and reach out to consumers across faith groups. \nOBJECTIVES: A)To provide a brief historical account of the international development of commercial faith based fashion, with particular attention to the dress practices of British Muslim, Jewish and Christian communities (and selected reference to their US counterparts). B)To explore the extent to which the internet rather than actual shops has been crucial in creating the conditions in which cross-faith shopping might develop. As well operational economies, internet shopping can make specialist and adventurous shopping more possible: anonymity in dealing with the virtual world makes it easier for individuals to connect to businesses and people outside of their faith communities than would be the case when physically entering a shop that was clearly coded as 'belonging' to a particular faith community. C)To establish whether e-retailers of modest clothing know if they already have or would welcome consumers from outside their target faith base. Does this prompt any changes in the business - be it range of products, advertising strategies, website atmospherics (visuals, language, music), or customer interaction? D)To find out if there are limits to the desirability of cross-faith business for retailers. Potentially expanding their consumer base might make sense for business, but is it also perceived to be in conflict with the company's religious motivation? \n\nAIM 2: To explore the extent to which 'modest fashion' is beginning to be recognisable as a form of dressing adopted by women from different faith communities.\nOBJECTIVE: A)To create an inventory of women's apparel that might constitute 'modest fashion'. B)To evaluate how this might vary across faith groups and regions. \n\nAIM 3: To evaluate the social and personal impact of modest fashion. \nOBJECTIVE: To develop an understanding of if and how shopping for modest rather than faith specific fashion changes women's sense of themselves and their relationship to their faith and wider communities. \n\nPOTENTIAL APPLICATIONS AND BENEFITS \nBy expanding the understanding of women's modest dress to include the three Abramic faiths, and by putting pious dressing in the frame of contemporary fashion, this research offers opportunities to foster dialogue between faiths and between religious and secular elements of society, and to challenge the normative secularised presumptions of the fashion industry.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research has potential to contribute to improvements in community cohesion and interfaith dialogue by drawing out the links between Muslim, Christian, and Jewish communities. By putting the practices of modest dress of these three faiths into relationship with each other, and by locating them in the frame of fashion, our research promises to draw points of connection between faiths and between the religious and the secular that could help remove the stigma often attached to visible religious dress. \n\nClothes, especially women's, are often understood by group members and external observers as a sign of community identity but they are also often regarded as outside the realm of fashion (characterized as modern, 'western', individuating, fast paced) and relegated to the domain of costume or group uniform (understood as expressive of ahistorical, unchanging, essentialised group rather than individual identities). This project reveals that faith is combined with fashion for many women in the UK's diverse population and that this is part of individuating identity formation processes that take place in dynamic relationships to internal community norms. \n\nThe focus on e-commerce promises to indicate that the de-territorialised and de-materialised nature of internet engagements makes possible a level of cross-faith activity for consumers not necessarily involved in overt inter-faith activities off-line in other areas of their lives. By emphasising that women from different faith groups are similarly concerned with matters of style and piety this research opens up new avenues for inter-faith dialogue and for interaction between religious and secular society. This has the potential to benefit community and third sector organisations such as inter-faith networks. Museums and galleries are also potential beneficiaries, especially in relation to current projects to create Islamic and other faith-based trails around permanent collections, and to curate new and temporary displays of diaspora and historical clothing and material culture.\n\nFor private sector beneficiaries in the fashion and creative industries the project's focus on religiously motivated dress practices will provide a comparative religious corrective to the normative and secularised presumptions underpinning fashion industry practice. Our research will disseminate summative and analytic material of significant potential importance about religious fashion cultures and emerging aesthetics still often unknown, or/and hard to discover. With the rise of religiosity among a young female demographic in the UK and internationally in all the major faiths, the need for the fashion industry to respond sensitively to consumers from religious communities is likely only to increase.\n\nFor the faith-based fashion market, this research will provide an opportunity to consider (and for participating companies to enter into) new forms of dialogue with existing consumers and to locate their design and commercial practices in relation to the religious and aesthetic considerations of other faith communities. Whilst the project's taxonomy of garments used for modest dressing across faiths has obvious commercial potential, it also has significant potential to increase the opportunities for interaction between faiths and with the secular world especially in relation to the educational and outreach work which many faith-based brands see as part of their remit. \n\nFor further and higher education in fashion, art and design in the UK, with a mandate to widen participation and develop inclusive curricula, this research has considerable potential benefit for both outreach work and the delivery of curriculum development. The primary and analytic material created by this project will be a valuable contribution to widening the curriculum in fashion design, management, and marketing studies, and for</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>80666</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The Artist's Robe: Adornment and Identity</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6DB8DE70-7A67-427D-B15F-4596514E2466</gtr:id><gtr:impact>public attended a talk

Thursday 12th March 2015
With the increase in faith schools, uniforms are often asked to do more than simply ensure that students are neat and tidy and easily recognisable. For faith schools, uniforms may serve to ensure adherence - or, at least, the appearance of adherence - to religiously related codes of conduct and modesty, for teachers and parents as well as students. Professor Reina Lewis of the London College of Fashion brings her Faith and Fashion series to JW3 in North London to discuss what constitutes today's school wardrobe.
Joining Reina to consider the nuance of school wear, are Claire Drucquer, a religious studies teacher who, as schools coordinator for Three Faiths Forum, works with people of all faiths and beliefs to build new intercommunal relationships, Patrick Moriarty, the Headteacher of JCoSS, the UK's first pluralist Jewish Secondary School who has a keen interest in interfaith dialogue, Aliya Azam, Head of Science at the Al Sadiq and Al Zahra Schools, whose interfaith activities include being Shia Co-President of the Christian Muslim Forum, and Rachel Fink, Headteacher of Hasmonean High School (Girls), currently participating in Cambridge's interfaith Coexist Leadership Programme.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d9613bd41dd7.66830956</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://events.arts.ac.uk/event/2015/3/12/Faith-and-Fashion-on-the-school-run/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Modest Fashion: Faith-based Fashion and Internet Retail</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>12A51724-6D4C-4E72-BBBD-EEF40206923E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>students, grad students, academics and press attended a launch panel discussion

Thursday 27 November 2014
In the context of breaking news that the Anglican Church has decided to allow women to become bishops, Professor Reina Lewis explores how a pioneering generation of women across the faiths have been developing vocational and professional dress for religiously related roles.
Reina is joined by the Reverend Sally Hitchiner, Anglican priest, broadcaster, and head of the largest multi faith university chaplaincy in Europe; by Sister Christine Frost who, as a member of the Sisters Faithful Companions of Jesus, does not wear a habit in her teaching and community work in London's East End; and by Amra Bone from Birmingham, Muslim chaplain, teacher, consultant on Islam and education, inter-faith community organiser, and currently the only woman in Europe to sit on a sharia council.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d961e2b6a6f8.17288201</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://events.arts.ac.uk/event/2014/11/27/FAITH-AND-FASHION-What-to-wear-for-work-when-you-work-for-God/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Companies have used my findings to adapt their offering to reach new and cross-faith consumer groups;school students, university undergraduates and postgraduates have used my findings in their studies; community groups have engaged in diverse forms of intra and interfaith dialogue using my studies; artists and designers have found their ideas expanded through learning of my studies; researchers in other fields (legal studies, sociology, urban studies, migration studies) have expanded their scope of enquiries to include fashion, dress, the body.

The internet has been central to the rapid growth of the modest fashion sector, fostering the development of a niche market through e-commerce, and providing virtual platforms for debates on modesty and fashion on websites, blogs, and discussion fora.

1 Our research demonstrated that there is a thriving online market for modest clothing. This market is growing, segmenting, and diversifying. It is fuelled by women from a variety of faiths, with consumers increasingly shopping from brands originating in faith groups other than their own.

2 Brands are often prepared to adapt their offering and their web presence to welcome cross faith consumers.

3. Some companies deliberately avoid specific religious connotations at all, and some also avoid the term 'modest' itself finding that it can obstruct sales to mainstream wholesalers and put off some retail consumers. 

4 The internet is facilitating discussions about modest dressing and behaviour in commercial and non-profit online modes. These discussions involve women in forms of intra- and inter-faith dialogue that they might not enter into offline. 

5 Modest dressing is not solely the preserve of the religious: we discovered a vocal cohort of modest dressers who define themselves as non-religious, or secular, as well as religious women who don't identify faith as the key motivator for their modest self-presentation. 

6 As well as including 'secular' dressers, one of the key contributions of this research, in the European context especially, is to widen understandings of Muslim modest dress to include Muslim women who are committed to modest self-presentation but do not interpret this to include a headscarf (hijab) let alone a face veil. 

7 Virtual activity about modest fashion is an important arena through which women can participate in the development online of new forms of religious authority, usually seen as male-dominated. This has the potential to displace discourses about modesty away from traditional religious authority structures.

8 The internet is not simply selling products that facilitate pre-existent practices of modest dress but is - though the combination of commerce and commentary - helping to grow and legitimate modest practices. 

9 The market is diversifying and segmenting with entrepreneurs branching out to cater to specific sectors of the modest dressing population. It seems likely that modest dressing consumers will be able to choose from companies designing for sub-segments of the modest sector in line with the segmentation common to mainstream apparel marketing (age, occupation, lifestyle, taste, and income). 

10. Already we can talk about a 'second' and 'third' generation of young designers and fashion advisors (on blogs, social media, digital magazines) who are increasingly confident with mainstream fashion industry styles and methods and can adapt them for the modest market with more flexibility than the modest sector pioneers even of the early 2000s.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The significance of the internet 

Opportunities for commerce: 

The reduced costs and marketing opportunities associated with internet retail have facilitated the creation, invention even, of all sorts of new niche markets. It is in this context that modest fashion has emerged as a lively specialist market offering new routes to consumers for existing off-line companies and providing affordable lower risk opportunities for e-retail start-ups. 

Companies involved in e-retail often have material on their websites about modesty or faith that is not directly commercial, and frequently host links to other sites of educational, spiritual, and political material, as well as to fashion websites generally. Increasingly brands, even small brands, also run a blog and have a presence on social media like Facebook and Twitter. This is sometimes outsourced to companies specialising in social media, sometimes from within the brand originator's faith community. In this modest fashion brands are replicating the marketing practices now common in mainstream fashion and lifestyle sectors of trying to encourage consumers to identify with the brand not just the product. In this case, the identification fostered is both with the brand and with practices of modesty. 

Opportunities for commentary: 

The significance of the internet in stimulating activity in relation to modest dressing does not apply only to designers, manufacturers, and brands, but also to the development of new forms of fashion advice and mediation such as blogs, virtual magazines, and discussion groups (fora) that make it easier for women to join in discussions about modest dressing and its role in their lives.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>F4E5A310-0F0F-4321-B511-1D54BE2575A9</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-9359655267.893948775bccf2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social
