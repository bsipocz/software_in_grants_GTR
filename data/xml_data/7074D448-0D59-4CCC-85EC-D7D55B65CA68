Yet while cities have a municipal authority to consider new ways of supplying energy to its urban citizens, those governing Africa's rural poor in small and medium towns in the surrounding rural hinterlands have rarely considered energy infrastructure.
Existing research indicates that many local authorities in Africa are struggling as they do not have the capacities and capabilities necessary to govern the complex social, political and economic situations they routinely face. Required to contribute inter alia to financial management, local and regional economic development, strategic planning in the local government, budgeting procedures, tax collection, procurement procedures and standards, ethics for local government staff and elected representatives, and action against corruption, it is hardly surprising that against this backdrop the demands placed on their time and capabilities would see energy planning neglected. And yet energy - in particular, clean energy for development - is becoming increasingly important not just to them in their specific geographical location, but to the wider region and world more generally. 
Local authority capacity across Africa therefore poses a fundamental challenge for successfully implementing clean energy for development programmes. In short, decentralisation could open the way for local authorities to become champions and drivers towards cleaner energy, but at the same time, their lack of capacity and capabilities is currently proving a major barrier to implementing clean energy development in African states. For sure, improving the understanding and evidence base of both the opportunities and challenges associated with implementing clean energy for development in Africa and it is this lacuna which this proposed research seeks to address.
To achieve this, the project has a number of foci. First, the project sets out to scope the size of the problem. There is an urgent need to document the roles and responsibilities of local authorities in African states to work out how these new roles impact the capacity and capabilities of local authorities (in different contexts) have been affected by the transfer of powers and budgets under decentralization initiatives. When a hospital needs a new generator, who decides? When the local market needs new lighting, who decides? Who has the power and budget to spend on energy?
Second, and having determined who typically holds the power and budgets, we will then explore their 'energy literacy'. Among all the other capacities and capabilities they must have to govern, our central question is do they have basic energy literacy? We take an energy-literate person is to be someone who: can trace energy flows and think in terms of energy systems; knows how much energy he or she uses, for what, and where that energy comes from; can assess the credibility of information about energy; can communicate about energy and energy use in meaningful ways; is able to make informed energy and energy use decisions based on an understanding of impacts and consequences. Put simply, there is an urgent need to ascertain whether decision makers have enough knowledge about energy to make positive decisions towards cleaner energy sources, and wider energy access for their citizens.
Here we will focus on local authorities in Rwanda and Kenya. The importance we attached to these two cases is guided by recognition that Rwandan local authorities have been budget holders for a number of years - therefore we expect them to be able to share their experiences of the challenge of running a district - whereas in Kenya, they are about to have elections that will give more power and budget to the local authorities, so they will be able to share both their hopes and expectations</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Ultimately, our goal is that this research will (i) raise the profile of local government roles within clean energy transitions in rural Africa amongst key national and international stakeholders, (ii) raise the profile of energy issues amongst local authorities themselves and (iii) help increase the capacity of those local authorities to play a facilitative role within clean energy transitions across their territories. 
We believe that the impact of this will in the long term lead to increased adoption of clean energy services among Africa's poor, which in turn will benefit communities by strengthening livelihoods, encouraging economic growth, improving health and protecting the environment. To this end, our simplified theory of change is captured in our key research questions. We will first seek to identify the roles and responsibilities of local authorities in relation to energy issues across Rural Africa. Once the frame of the research is established this will lead to an analysis of whether this role has already been affected by the transfer of powers and budgets under decentralization initiatives. The analysis leads us to hypothesise, with evidence, the implications of further more profound transformations under current decentralization impulses, and to determine whether action on the level of awareness of local authorities in terms of energy literacy will be likely to affect the outcomes of longer-term planning for the increased uptake of clean energy technologies within this context? If, as we predict, the research leads to the conclusion that such action in enhancing the energy literacy of local authorities will have substantial positive implications on clean energy transitions, then our research will have formed the basis and provided evidence for a more substantial intervention by governments, donors or civil society, to strengthen the energy literacy of local authorities. 

We will work hard in interacting with the key relevant stakeholders within the two target countries and beyond in ensuring that the evidence distilled through this research will help convince policy-makers and donors of the crucial need to invest in enhancing the energy literacy of local authorities and improving their capacity to play a strong facilitative role within clean energy transitions. The key stakeholder groups are policy actors in and beyond the specific countries of study and the market actors in the specific countries of study. Policy actors includes both donors and other agencies that design or implement energy related interventions, as well as national and local government agencies that manage the policy environment. National authorities include those responsible for building the capacity of local authorities and may not be directly related to energy planning. For instance, the Uganda Ministry of Local Government would be a prime stakeholder, as would the equivalent Ministry of Local Government in Kenya. The market actors include both the formal and informal private sectors including the utilities, emerging Energy Supply Companies and civil society organizations involved in energy-related projects. 

Within the study areas, key informants from local authorities will contribute data while at the same time have their awareness of the issues enhanced by the questioning process. At a National level we expect that the feedback of our findings will enable some specific actors to enhance or redirect their interventions, possibly to engage local authorities or to begin programmes of awareness building. The workshops will be convened by Practical Action who have convening power within the chosen countries. Beyond the specific workshops we will use opportunities to present our findings at relevant national, regional, and international conferences convened by others. The findings of the research will be documented in a series of guidelines or policy notes tailored to the different audiences.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-10-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>108682</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Community Energy Malawi</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Malawi, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Malawi District Energy Governance</gtr:description><gtr:id>33B9DC06-A571-4648-9EF6-135C11ED73B9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>1.

Nexus thinking, increasingly advocated as an integrative approach to building synergies and reducing trade-offs across the water, food and energy sectors (e.g. Hoff, 2011), has coincided with a period of dramatic transformations in the political and energy contexts of the Global South. Widespread political decentralisation has taken place, while the issue of energy access and decentralised energy as a potential solution has risen in prominence. These changes prompt the question of what role decentralised governance structures could take in realising nexus approaches to decentralised energy transitions, yet existing literature in this field has been critiqued for a lack of attention to the crucial part played by local governance and changing national-local political relationships (Stevens &amp;amp; Gallagher, 2015). This is of particular surprise given the extensive nature of many current political decentralisation drives in developing countries. This paper aims to bridge the gap between the literatures on political decentralisation and nexus approaches to decentralised energy, which have hitherto largely been discussed as separate entities. Focussing predominantly on Kenya, site of one of &amp;quot;the most rapid and ambitious devolution processes in the world&amp;quot; (World Bank, 2015), it attempts to better understand the role of local governance in implementing a more harmonised nexus and how political decentralisation might facilitate and enhance this process. A range of issues within this context will be explored: How the various scales of governance interact within the energy, water and food sectors and how they might be most effectively coordinated; How can institutional disconnect, power imbalances and the increasing complexity of greater cross-sector integration be resolved?; How energy governance might be enhanced by greater powers for local authorities</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6ce6bcd1f01.99979315</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Keynote ICDRET Dhaka Jan 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5DAD7040-3FFD-4E31-93A4-A137B60E6178</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The PI of the READ project was the keynote speaker at the 4th International Conference on Developments in Renewable Energy Technologies where he focused on a series of lessons drawn from the READ work, relating also to the experiences of SONG in Kenya and Bangladesh.

identify the local governance of energy issues in Kenya generally and Nakuru specifically (2) To identify the nature of decentralization processes in Kenya and their actual and potential impacts on a range of different issues relating to energy (3) To assess the levels of understanding about decentralised energy amongst key stakeholders (4) To map key stakeholders and (5) To work together with 
stakeholders to identify key issues and suggest ways in which to move forward.
Through a mixture of presentations, discussions and stakeholder mapping exercises, the workshop encouraged a wide range of discussion about how best to address energy access issues through the new county structures in Kenya. 
Key themes addressed included: (a) the poor state of energy access in the county with large proportions lacking access to electricity and efficient technologies for cooking and heating; (b) the fact that here is lack of clear understanding of the roles, responsibilities and authority of 
key stakeholders including county government following recent changes in Kenya to a new decentralised political system. (c) the lack of county government control over large scale energy generation in the county (e.g. geothermal); (d) the socio-cultural issues associated with some energy technologies (e.g. energy production from human waste); (e) lack of capacity and standards/quality control and high 
installation costs of biogas systems; high costs of equipment, lack of quality control and lack of awareness about
the potential of solar energy; lack of awareness, limited distribution and lack of quality control in the Improved Cook Stove 
(ICS) sector are some of the key constraints that affect energy access in the county. (f) Despite the above constraints, 
national energy policies and implementation plans indicate political will towards decentralization of authority, 
resources and capacities as well as increasing effort towards increasing energy access through decentralised energy 
options.

On the way forward stakeholders agreed on the need for the following actions they would take forward, some of which 
could be the basis for future READ intervention which is being planned: 
(i) Create awareness amongst and build the capacity on decentralized energy access at the county level, share information and replicate similar workshops, assess knowledge, identify challenges and develop sustainable technologies; 
(ii) Collaborate with the Nakuru county government to expand the briquetting sector for improved livelihoods of low income communities; 
(iii) Lobby the UK government to provide energy awareness training in Kenya;
 (iv) On technology development stakeholders will focus on learning more about geothermal production; up-scaling biogas;
(v) joint fund-raising; creating dialogue and county level collaboration on green energy; 
(vi) liaising with National and County governments on Renewable energy issues, decentralization and capacity building; developing RE training material; influencing County government on renewable energy laws / policies; compiling / sharing RE case studies, among other strategies.

Contacts made during this workshop have resulted in discussions over the development of further small-scale solar projects in the county, they have also been fed into Practical Action's advocacy work around the National Energy Bill and the development of SE4All activities.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d86d8208ed64.66040961</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://thereadproject.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/READ-Stakeholders-Workshop-Report-_Kenya_Final-15.10.14.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Rwandan Workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>306E26AA-7B73-427B-B3AB-1D2F2D97046C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The 
The workshop was attended by 23 participants from Ministries, Public Agencies, Districts, Administrative Sectors, NGOs/INGOs, ICS associations and cooperatives. The workshop aimed at developing an understanding ofthe impact of political decentralization in Rwanda 
on decentralized energy access. 
The objectives of the workshops were 
(1) To confirm the project team's understanding of the systems of local government in Rwanda 
(2) To understand better the role of local governments in addressing energy access issues in Rwanda 
(3)To map key stakeholders in the energy sector 
(4) To learn lessons from the Rwandan experience for the new Kenyan decentralization process, particularlyin relation to energy issues 
(5) To understand how local governance works in practice here, the opportunities that it provides for energy access progress and any 
potential limitation.
In-line with the objectives of the workshop participants shared knowledge and their experiences on decentralized energy access in Rwanda, discussed challenges to energy decentralization and identified measures to enhance capacities of local authorities to play their role in promoting access to clean energy in Rwanda. 
Major constraints to the role of Districts and sectors in energy access in Rwanda include: 
1. Renewable energy solutions are still very expensive yet the purchase power of the rural population is still very low (45% of Rwandans are below poverty line and majority in rural areas), 
2. There is limited technical capacity for the installation, operation and maintenance of clean energy technologies such as solar and biogas, 
particularly in rural areas.
3. Some behavioural characteristics among the population negatively impacts on the adoption of modern renewable energy technologies 
However, with a clear national energy development plan and the government's political will towards real decentralisation of authority, resources and capacities, the role of the decentralised authorities in energy access is expected to increase. 
At the end of the workshop, participants identified key next steps to enhance decentralised energy access: 
(i) The government and stakeholders to explore innovative financing mechanisms for clean energy projects, drawing on experiences such as M-kopa used in Kenya
(ii) Districts and Sectors to use the Participatory Market Mapping tool for better coordination of stakeholders' efforts and taking advantage of available synergies for enhanced energy access 
(iii) Energy platforms to be created at the District and Sector levels to provide more space for stakeholders' discussions on energy challenges and promote harmonized planning and implementation of energy programmes for more impact 
(iv) The government and stakeholders to engage into systematic capacity 
building process to create a critical mass of technicians at District and Sector levels who are capable of installing, 
operating, maintaining, repairing renewable energy technologies in the country</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d870d17a4f79.52693156</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://thereadproject.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/READ-Workshop-Report_Rwanda_Final-15.10.14.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>USES Annual Workshop Presentation 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>266C18BE-77CD-4FCE-AA0B-79C90B53F814</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Several of the READ team presented key lessons from the READ project at the second annual USES Workshop.

The level of success of our efforts will be measured via: evidence of profile raising of these issues across a variety of international fora; evidence of addressing of these issues within other publications/documentation; achievement of follow-up projects etc.

It is difficult, however to measure this in terms of ultimate beneficiaries. For example, if our scoping of the issues results in improved energy governance amongst Kenyan county authorities this has the potential to significantly enhance access of Kenyan citizens to clean energy resources, it is extremely difficult, however, to make claims for direct impact upon those beneficiaries or to calculate specific numbers.

In the Case for Support we explained that this project involves the scoping of a potentially major but so far under-documented problem. As explained there, &amp;quot;in bringing together the literature and documenting the problem we hope to generate multiple outputs that may influence policy formation (although we acknowledge that within the timeframe of the project this will 'influence the policy debate' rather than actual policy formation). .Through this documentation of the problem we will strongly encourage others to follow up with interventions - such as training and capacity building in energy literacy.&amp;quot;

Within the specific context of Kenya, Practical Action have been able to draw upon the work conducted for READ in (a) raising the profile of county government roles in energy governance in other funded work on the new energy bill in Kenya and (b) promoting the importance of local level governance to the successful outcome of the Kenyan SE4All strategy. The work conducted for READ has also had a direct influence upon the evolution of the SONG project in Kenya where INTASAVE have developed a strong relationship with the county authorities in determining the development of the nano-grids project beyond its original USES phase. Finally, we are talking to other organizations working in the Kenyan energy sector (with whom, for example, we have already run joint events specifically addressing local energy governance) about other potential avenues for funding further capacity enhancing work amongst Kenyan county governments (our Kenyan partner, has, for example, been involved in developing a training programme for women in solar energy which has involved some county level employees).

The project is now formally closed in terms of the original funding period although we continue to work on taking forward the work initiated via the project in a number of different directions. As suggested above, it is clear that the success of READ will ultimately depend upon its ability to get questions of political decentralization and enhancing local governance onto the agenda of major stakeholders nationally and internationally across the clean energy sector. To that end we have taken the following steps to ensure that the work started by READ is taken up and taken forward.
(a) We have appointed a three year PhD student (jointly funded by Loughborough and the EPSRC) who will be directly working with partners in Kenya to take forward some of the lessons from the READ project in improving local energy governance (particularly in relation to the Energy/Water/Food nexus); 
(b) We have advertised a position funded via INTASAVE. This is a research development post designed to secure further research funding for collaborations around local energy governance initiatives. We have so far been unable to fill this post but are currently redesigning the post specifications ready for a further recruitment round. 
(c) We (Loughborough and GAMOS) together with our partners from the SONG Project (INTASAVE) and the University of Surrey made a bid (&amp;pound;200,000) to Innovate's Energy Catalyst Call to further explore ideas on the development of solar electric cooking. Part of this is linked specifically to the potential role of local governments in promoting these kinds of solutions in different contexts. 
(d) We are submitting a project proposal for impact enhancement funding to Loughborough which is designed to take forward the insights of the project. This will involve: running training sessions with county officials; establishing a virtual local energy governance research hub; conducting a review of the local governance components of the recently announced Kenyan SE4All strategy;
(e) Following a key-note presentation on READ at the bi-annual ICDRET conference in Dhaka, we are in initial conversations with partners in Bangladesh about a small project exploring the governance aspects of the rapidly expanding mini-grid roll-out in Bangladesh.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>B402046A-A512-4B0F-ACAA-5E8DDFDBCA1D</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d9adc71a05a6.05961334</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Energy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Conceptual Findings
We began this project by emphasizing the existence of relatively voluminous (and rapidly growing) literatures on both (a) the advocacy, uptake and implications of political decentralization and (b) the growing global trends towards decentralisation of energy supply and management but also the lack of inter-connections between those literatures. Over the curse of the project we attempted to lay out the major contours of both literatures and to begin the task of elaborating their main points of connection.

We noted the growing recognition of the limitations of our dominant highly centralized energy systems, the calls for radical transformations of those systems and the emergence of the first tentative steps in those directions in industrialised economies (via community energy schemes, small to medium-scale RE plants, district heating systems, urban CHP systems and the spread of household-scale technologies for heating, cooling and electricity generation). At the same time as these first steps are being taken in countries with long-established national grid systems, there has also been recognition that the same kinds of technological and organizational innovations that lie behind the potential for transforming those systems also provide significant potential for the emergence of innovative new, significantly less centralized, energy systems within countries where significant numbers of people currently live outside of the reach of national electricity grids (which are themselves frequently highly inefficient) and frequently without access to other modern energy services.

We also explored some of the claims being made about the potential benefits of enhanced energy decentralization (ranging through questions of efficiency, security, affordability and enhanced access, as well as opportunities to significantly democratize energy system governance, ownership and the distribution of costs and benefits), as well as some of the key barriers to its accelerated uptake. We also highlighted the impossibility of discussing significant restructuring of our energy systems without considering how those systems connect into the broader social patterns of our societies and stressing how many of the controversies surrounding the potential futures envisioned under decentralized energy are actually intimately connected to broader long-running debates over the nature and implications of political decentralization. 

Accordingly, we have also explored some of these broader debates and outlined some of the key claims made for the developmental impacts of political decentralization (relating to such issues as the efficiency of service delivery, the strengthening of democracy and the enhancement of participation within decision-making processes etc.), as well as some of the main arguments surrounding its ability to deliver on those promises.

This then led into perhaps the major focus of our research where we looked at the role of local authorities in addressing energy issues (within the context of the debates over energy decentralization touched upon above) and how these roles are being (or stand to be) affected by further processes of political decentralization. Local authorities have played a role in some countries in the North in promoting decentralized energy initiatives and low carbon transitions via, for example, accelerating innovation (from taking on direct roles in energy generation and distribution to spear-heading programmes designed to change citizen and business energy-usage behavior). These kinds of activities have also been promoted by some national governments as part of the empowerment of sub-national authorities or at least their strong engagement as partners within national energy strategies. Although, it was also emphasized that rhetorical commitments by national governments to local management of developments in decentralised energy have also been frequently contradicted by continued promotion of centralized energy models, lack of resource transfer to sub-national levels and a lack of coordination of different levels of energy governance and that, as a result, in general terms local authority action in this area continues to be highly fragile, fragmented and reversible.

Moving on to explore the role of local authorities in relation to energy issues in the Global South and the potential implications of the continued advocation of further processes of political decentralization. We began by exploring UNDP's (2009) assessment of the degree to which responsibility for energy issues had been incorporated into the legislation governing political decentralization initiatives. Their exhaustive survey confirmed that in only 4 out of 64 cases had energy issues been formally mentioned, confirming that there is at present very poor connectivity between national approaches towards decentralization and local governance and national energy policy (mirroring the lack of cross-fertilization of ideas within the academic and grey/policy literatures addressing both topics). This lack of connectivity was borne out by our review of current local government involvement within the energy sector which emphasized the limited involvement of local governments within energy generation, distribution and electrification initiatives and other areas of national energy policy.

Nonetheless, a few important exceptions were highlighted relating to local government involvement in some specific national programmes relating to electrification, fuelwood management, liquid fossil fuel policy and access to mechanical power. These few national programmes and a host of case study examples of actions taken by some individual local authorities help illustrate how national political decentralization processes if they are resourced and designed effectively could play highly significant roles in helping to facilitate the evolution of effective, decentralized energy systems across the Global South through their potential role in such areas as: equipping local authorities to play important roles in assessing energy needs and aspirations, acting as information and training hubs, coordinating local energy actors, connecting energy interventions into local and regional development strategies (and local planning relating to water, health and agriculture etc.) and in some cases as direct implementers of energy interventions. 

The most successful and sustainable local authority interventions within the energy sector appear to have occurred where (i) there has been sufficient local/regional control of budgets, (ii) where there has been a strong coordinated programme of capacity building for local institutions and (iii) where it has occurred as part of a multi-level collaboration with clearly defined roles for each actor. Nevertheless, it is important to emphasize that most local authorities as suggested above are, for a host of different reasons (e.g. lack of political will, enabling structures, training, knowledge, resources, legitimacy etc.), not currently playing these roles.

How, then, might the capacity of local governments across the Global South to play the positive roles in relation to energy issues described above be accentuated and what might the implications of further waves of political decentralization towards those aims be? We conclude with a few final thoughts on these issues.

1. One of the major conclusion of the 2009 UNDP study referred to above was that &amp;quot;(e)nhancing energy service delivery at the local level will require better coordination and accountability mechanisms between national and local institutions, and across sectors, as well as empowerment of local authorities to plan and manage energy&amp;quot; (UNDP, 2009:7). We agree with this observation and suggest that there has been little progress towards that end over recent years; although we also concede that there is clearly a need for more coordinated cross-country comparative work tracing the legal responsibilities for energy issues across different levels of government, as well as updating UNDP's work on the degree to which energy issues have been incorporated into decentralization legislation.

2. Of course even where legal responsibility has been established and effective multi-level governance for energy issues created, without adequate resource transfers and training and capacity building elements for local government, they are unlikely to be successful.

3. There remains an urgent need for further in-depth studies of how decentralization has affected energy governance within specific national and sectoral contexts. The READ project has making some small steps towards this objective through our focus on the Kenyan and Rwandan contexts (see other READ working papers and workshop reports).

4. Since the UNDP study was published in 2009, there do not appear to have been any further significant research studies of the relationship between energy and decentralisation undertaken before the READ project. At the same time, however, the interest in decentralised energy within the Global South has exploded with a particular emerging interest in the potential proliferation of mini-grids as a major contributor to the meeting of Energy4All access targets. Despite a clear relationship between the potentially extremely large-scale development of community-scale energy initiatives like mini-grids and the continuing advocacy and indeed adoption of political decentralisation (the recent Kenyan devolution process being a case in point), most of the considerable literature in this field does not specifically look in detail at the question of how the governance of decentralised energy relates to the formal structures of political governance. This is an area that we are exploring in detail to be published as a further READ working paper.

5. Far too often in the literature discussion of both political and energy decentralisation is stripped of its political context. It must be remembered that decentralization is an ongoing process not an end-state and one that is ultimately highly political and contested between different actors and not a one-off event. There is nothing natural about the outcome; it is process which is constantly in flux, always being defended and challenged. The what and where of political/energy decentralisation is only the starting point (the rhetoric) - questions of agency (who is involved, what factors are at play), process (how is it being pursued/achieved - i.e. through what mechanisms), and specific interests (why are they doing it) are ultimately the key to understanding what is possible/not possible.

Please see the project working papers (and academic papers as they are published) for further details about our work in Kenya and Rwanda, as well as more specific discussions around the dynamics of decentralization in Africa, energy literacy and capacity-building tools.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our research will be of interest to companies and other organizations seeking to invest in clean energy technologies in Africa.
It will also be of interest to policymakers and other stakeholders charged with developing policy towards clean energy transitions.
We are actively looking for funding to undertake more detailed work with a range of partner organizations in Kenya to promote the importance of the local governance of energy policy and to enhance the capacity for energy planning of county-level authorities.
Finally, there is clearly considerable scope for further research in this area building upon what we have been able to achieve through the READ project.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>850F30EA-1D25-4A56-BA10-08A21B71F41B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d9b2696e2624.91157429</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Energy,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://thereadproject.co.uk/?page_id=108</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>District Energy Policy</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Africa</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8F4EE50E-7D18-43E3-8ABF-D4B0F338A93D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c2a321c27c26.81943430</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7111B688-51D0-4477-8158-1C7D1E7200B4</gtr:id><gtr:title>Rwanda Stakeholders Workshop Report, Kigali</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/37cea59f4da8278afb781e60e457eac9"><gtr:id>37cea59f4da8278afb781e60e457eac9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bahingana, V.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>54634e66076e80.64427928</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>CF5C1063-5522-43DC-88EF-8C599D44FC98</gtr:id><gtr:title>Governance, Decentralisation and Energy: A Critical Review of the Key Issues</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6ce6c4a63b38e4538b69ed16ae99fadc"><gtr:id>6ce6c4a63b38e4538b69ed16ae99fadc</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Brown E D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56d9b39e193253.73501539</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>28521BDD-8A52-4A5B-B078-494028D9526F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Tools for Improving Decentralised Governance of Energy</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d967295dc4196c09a5c1cea5568cebdf"><gtr:id>d967295dc4196c09a5c1cea5568cebdf</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Batchelor, S.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>54634ca25f51e3.07010015</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5FD31F00-B180-454C-8B2B-EE90D35E36F2</gtr:id><gtr:title>Decentralisation in Sub-Saharan Africa: Prevalence, scope and challenges</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d967295dc4196c09a5c1cea5568cebdf"><gtr:id>d967295dc4196c09a5c1cea5568cebdf</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Batchelor, S.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>54634b41d36d48.36973090</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>015689AA-A0B2-4434-9087-D1C875411179</gtr:id><gtr:title>The LCEDN USES Network: Crossing Boundaries, Breaking Barriers</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Boiling Point</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d68913fc0d03a5b71a39845761a841ba"><gtr:id>d68913fc0d03a5b71a39845761a841ba</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Brown, E.
