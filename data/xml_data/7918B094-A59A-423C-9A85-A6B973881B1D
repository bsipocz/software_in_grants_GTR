Neuropathic pain (NP), a common type of chronic pain, occurs after damage to the sensory nervous system and has a wide range of causes including diabetes, trauma, surgery, cancer and autoimmune disease. Current treatments often do not provide adequate pain relief for patients, or have intolerable side effects. Animals can be used to improve our understanding of a disease and to test the effectiveness of novel treatments. There are many different ways of modelling NP and these animals are subjected to many different tests, some of which cause more pain or distress than others. The main aim of this study is to refine the tests used in order to reduce the suffering of animals and to reduce the number of animals used.
Systematically identifying all available studies will provide an overview of the range of methods used in the modelling of NP. Aggregating these data together will give us direct evidence of the utility of high severity tests, whether multiple tests are necessary, whether lengthy experiments are of added value or whether those of shorter duration areas useful and will guide us on the number of animals required for future studies. This project will, for the first time, provide evidence from completed experiments in NP to reduce and refine the use of animals in this field of research.
Previously, there have been significant problems in translating findings from animal studies to humans in a clinical setting. We have shown that when you systematically scrutinise studies there are often flaws in their design, conduct and reporting. These shortcomings in the quality of experiments tend to result in studies exaggerating the magnitude of their findings. Using the dataset we will assess the quality of studies and the impact of this quality on their findings. In the past similar shortcomings in human clinical trials led to substantial reforms in their conduct and regulation. Unfortunately, the same standards for the conduct of laboratory animal studies do not exist; however, the systematic scrutiny of animal studies modelling neurological diseases has initiated the beginnings of a similar process. The impetus behind this is in response to the empirical evidence describing the impact of reduced quality and insufficient reporting in animal models of stroke. Using similar techniques and curating empirical evidence has the potential to reform and improve the utility of animal models of NP.
Within the scientific community there is a tendency towards publishing positive results. Studies reporting no or negative effects are often not published. This bias results in summaries of a research field, such as the proposed, overstating true effects. We plan to quantify the presence and magnitude of publication bias in the NP literature. If laboratory studies are to be used to improve human health their findings need to be both reliable and available irrespective of the results. 
In summary, this study will provide an overview of all animal studies of NP. These data will allow us to assess the validity and utility of high severity tests in comparison to those inflicting less pain and distress to animals. In addition we will be able to quantify the value of varying durations of experiments and potentially improve the welfare of animals used in this field of research. Describing the quality and range of studies will allow to provide evidence based guidelines to improve the design, conduct and reporting of NP animal studies. Quantifying the magnitude of publication bias will highlight the severity of the problem and hopefully drive reform to improve the publicising of experimental data. We also plan to make the database publicly available for colleagues in the field; this will reduce unnecessary replication of experiments.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Neuropathic pain (NP) is a major clinical problem and current therapies do not provide adequate analgesia for many patients. Subjecting animals to lesions modelling NP, or to tests designed to assess responses to painful stimuli, is inevitably associated with distress and discomfort.
We plan to systematically identify all animal experiments modelling NP. Using meta-regression we will provide evidence as to whether less noxious tests are as predictive as more severe alternatives to refine their use to minimise pain and suffering. We will also investigate the effect of experimental duration and post-operative analgesia regimens to reduce the period of suffering of the animals. We will provide precise estimates of the observed variance of different tests. This will identify which tests require fewer animals and allow robust sample size calculations to be performed and reported to reduce the number of animals sacrificed in experiments which are too small for the effect sought or those which use more animals than required.
Limitations in the validity of experiments reduce their reliability and may compromise their utility. Preclinical studies rarely report measures to reduce potential sources of bias. We will use meta-analysis to quantify the impact of quality on estimates of treatment effects in the NP literature.
We will quantify the impact of publication bias in the NP literature; this will highlight the importance of the issue and encourage the dissemination of all data derived from the use of animals. We will also make the database publicly available; this will enable colleagues to identify whether experiments have already been conducted and reduce the unnecessary replication of experiments.
This project will generate robust empirical data without the use of animals. It will contribute towards a reduction in the number of animals used and the refinement of experimental design, tests used and has the potential to reform and improve animal welfare in this field.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/66BB3CDB-84B4-41B5-AB21-FEC312E91CC8"><gtr:id>66BB3CDB-84B4-41B5-AB21-FEC312E91CC8</gtr:id><gtr:name>NC3Rs</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>208907</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NC/K000659/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
