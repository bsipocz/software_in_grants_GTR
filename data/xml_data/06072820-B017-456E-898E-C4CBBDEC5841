Loneliness is one measure of compromised social relationships and is a significant problem for older people with approximately 42 per cent of those aged 65 plus in England reporting loneliness (10 per cent reporting severe loneliness and 32 per cent reporting moderate loneliness); 3.2 million individuals in England.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Loneliness has important negative consequences for both older adults and society being linked with a range of negative health, social and service use outcomes. Because of the importance of loneliness as a problem for older people a range of services to combat loneliness have been developed but few have actually achieved this aim. We suggest that part of the failure of current services is because we do not understand the pathways into and out of loneliness; the characteristics of those groups who move/into and out of loneliness; the factors that are linked with changes in loneliness and how social and health factors are linked to loneliness pathways. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>The availability of this information may help us to design services that are more timely and tailored to the needs of individual older people and help to promote quality of life in old age.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The ultimate aim of this project is to explore the dynamics of loneliness longitudinally in a large national sample focusing upon describing and understanding changes in loneliness longitudinally and identifying the factors predictive of changes in loneliness as a basis for developing more sophisticated and personalised interventions to remediate loneliness. There are 3.2 million individuals aged 65+ in England who experience loneliness. Death rates are 50% higher and emergency hospital admission rates are a third (30%) higher for those who are lonely compared with those who are not. Those who are lonely consult their GP, on average, 10 times a year compared with 3 times for those who are not lonely. Reducing loneliness and its consequences is a long term goal, and it is expected that it will have, in the long term, social impact resultant from our study contributing towards: evidence based policy-making; shaping and enhancing the effectiveness of public services; helping to transform evidenced based policy into practice and influencing professionals and practitioners working in related fields. 

In the shorter term, there will be a range of opportunities for the research team to contribute to current debates, policy and practice via our partnership with The Campaign to End Loneliness. Building strong research relationships with potential users, fellow researchers and other relevant parties in the early stages of the project will provide the foundation for creating significant impact in the longer term. Indeed, an important short to medium term impact will arise from the creation of strong working relationships with the range of stakeholders involved in order to facilitate collaboration in developing new projects, the co-production of new research, conference presentations and other activities aimed at raising the profile of this important topic.

Who will benefit and how?

a) Policy makers and practitioners

New knowledge will be generated upon which to develop appropriate policies, practices and understanding about how to identify people vulnerable to the onset/worsening of loneliness in later life and how to support and identify those recovering from loneliness;

b) Third sector and voluntary organisations

Increasingly, the social and physical environment for older people has become central in promoting well-being in later life. This project will recognise the specific needs of older people who experience loneliness and help the Campaign to End Loneliness and other organisations (eg Contact the Elderly) to better understand this populations' needs;

c) Older people 

The voices of older people remain muted within much research and this is especially so for those who experience loneliness. Our project will give a voice to this important group of older people and ensure that their concerns and issues are made visible to the research, policy and practice communities;

d) Early career researcher (ECR)

The employment of an ECR will enhance their substantive and methodological skills but they will benefit from a range of career development activities including advice on publishing, mentoring and the opportunity to broaden their networks amongst a range of relevant communities (academic, policy, practice &amp;amp; older people).The ECR will be managed according to the Researcher Development Framework and will have the opportunity to develop a learning needs plan to ensure that all elements of the framework are addressed on completion of the project. A key feature of this plan will be in enabling the ECR to attend national and international conferences to benefit from engaging with the networks of the applicants;

e) Research capacity

Inclusion within the project of a Brunel University sponsored study day focused upon using secondary data within gerontological research will be of particular benefit to ECR/PhD students who will be able to attend free of charge.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-02-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-04-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>152243</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Campaign to End Loneliness</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Co chair of the Campaign to End Loneliness Research Hub</gtr:description><gtr:id>2E39D780-A4CA-4C99-964B-66B876B393D4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Promising approaches to reducing loneliness and isolation in later life (http://www.campaigntoendloneliness.org/wp-content/uploads/Promising-approaches-to-reducing-loneliness-and-isolation-in-later-life.pdf)

Working with our partner-the Campaign to End Loneliness the information from this project (combined with other data from the United States) informed a range of publications including Promising approaches to reducing loneliness and isolation (Campaign to End Loneliness), Measuring you impact on loneliness in later life (Campaign to End Loneliness) and Combating Loneliness (Local Government Association).Working with the Campaign we have worked with Public Health England to raise loneliness as a public health issue. Our work contributed to the NICE guidelines of promoting independence and mental wellbeing for older people. Prof Victor was a member of the committee that drew up these guidelines. 

The outcomes from the project have been very actively promoted at international conferences (Australia, Sweden and USA) and-very importantly -to the general population and third sector organisations such public lectures at the University and presentations to a wide range of Age UK organisations (Hillingdon, Norfolk, Oxford).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>84F3DBFE-AD94-4B53-ABD5-51F61D0A775B</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>551a50868b0301.09771113</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Our project, using secondary analysis of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) has identified the following key findings:-

a) over a 10 year follow up period the majority of older people (aged 50+) are not lonely (approximately 65%);

b) that there are five key loneliness pathways-the never lonely; the always lonely; those for whom loneliness increases or decreases and those with a fluctuating pattern

 c) that established loneliness risk factors such as widowhood do not operate homogeneously. Some widow(ers) experience loneliness and others do not reflecting their access to other supportive factors;

d) that pets are not protective against loneliness-they are both a protection to loneliness and a response to it but only for women

e) that expectations of loneliness are strongly associated with loneliness outcomes</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings have informed the development of the evaluation of the Ageing Better loneliness interventions, contributed towards shaped the activity of the Campaign to End loneliness</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A3D5C62A-BE4F-483F-B1F6-AB1E3A04DC32</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>551a5003d039d2.37743610</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://youtu.be/hmjMMkPQaDM</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Member NICE Public Health Committee on Older people: promoting independence and mental wellbeing</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>71F4B542-C9BB-47B5-9485-7BCC5F9260C2</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56c37c73a91428.24816092</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Membership of a guideline committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D345FB09-8588-4D99-8076-1B8C6266F30F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Does owning a pet protect older people against loneliness?</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>BMC geriatrics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7de69037660ccd416b8502a906401dd7"><gtr:id>7de69037660ccd416b8502a906401dd7</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pikhartova J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1471-2318</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>544587b322fcd9.24060858</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6C9AE991-57C8-4BC3-9D80-50750CCBC4DD</gtr:id><gtr:title>Is loneliness in later life a self-fulfilling prophecy?</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Aging &amp; mental health</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7de69037660ccd416b8502a906401dd7"><gtr:id>7de69037660ccd416b8502a906401dd7</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pikhartova J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1360-7863</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>551a516667b967.48998810</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/K004077/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>B57EEFB7-602E-4F5D-92E4-A0C265266249</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Demography &amp; human geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>808111E3-5E04-4CEF-B080-565A81EFD6D0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Demography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
