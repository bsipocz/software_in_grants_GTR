In the absence of effective control methods, crop losses to carrot fly can be &amp;gt;50%. Effective and durable forms of host plant resistance will enhance crop productivity, meeting new and existing EU pesticide regulations and reducing environmental impact. At present, UK carrot fly is controlled with broad spectrum insecticides. There is already evidence of polygenic partial resistance to carrot fly and this has been incorporated into a small number of varieties. However, this resistance is insufficient to make a major contribution to a reduction in pesticide use. In this project Warwick University will develop techniques to identify and evaluate sources of host plant resistance to carrot fly in wild species, heritage varieties and existing breeding lines and develop a high-throughput phenotype screen. Rijk Zwaan will develop a laboratory test for resistance, independent of seasonal variations in the open field. They will also develop a segregating F2-population between a resistant and a susceptible variety to be able to find molecular markers for resistance traits and they will investigate possibilities for combining different mechanisms of quantitative resistance to obtain an even higher level of resistance. Innovative components of the project include a reliable high-throughput screen for resistance to carrot fly, experimental techniques to separate different components of resistance, development of markers for resistance traits and a reliable method of screening young plants in the laboratory.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>112423</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Poster at 2015 Horticulture and Potatoes: Unlocking Innovation through Science and Collaboration</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C3EACC9D-4F13-434A-9AC4-F0678020D1B1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Poster at 2015 Horticulture and Potatoes: Unlocking Innovation through Science and Collaboration on 25-26 February 2015 'Accelerated introgression of host plant resistance to carrot fly into elite carrot varieties'.

1. Evaluate wild species, heritage varieties and existing breeding lines for resistance to carrot fly.
2. Develop a high throughput screen so that large numbers of accessions can be evaluated in a consistent manner.
3. Develop techniques to identify and evaluate new sources of host plant resistance to carrot fly.
4. Develop a technique for maintaining a laboratory population of carrot fly so that tests of potentially resistant materials can be undertaken year round.
5. Develop a laboratory test for resistance that will be independent of seasonal variations in the open field.

All goals and milestones listed above were achieved, and Rijk Zwaan are now in the position to begin the breeding process for a new carrot fly resistant variety. Rijk Zwaan have now identified sources of resistance and have made segregationg groups of resistant material from which to breed a new carrot variety. Rijk Zwaan now have the laboratory technique to maintain carrot fly populations and can phenotype in the laboratory thus cutting down on the random nature of some field trials. These techniques are dramatically speeding up the breeding process and will lead to new commercially available varieties. Field trials are still necessary but with the rapid turn round in the laboratory the breeding process for carrot fly resistance has been shortened. The biggest challenge in the project was to maintain the carrot population year round in the laboratory which has been achieved.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Rijk Zwaan are now in the position to begin the breeding process for a new carrot fly resistant variety.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>902E5E98-6E91-4D13-861F-C93D676C0AE8</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56de8b63ac2041.01879756</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">TS/I001689/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5B25B6A3-B218-4F11-8A9D-661236DF455C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agri-environmental science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6F3E4891-E3E8-4568-94D8-075A0552DE90</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Crop protection</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
