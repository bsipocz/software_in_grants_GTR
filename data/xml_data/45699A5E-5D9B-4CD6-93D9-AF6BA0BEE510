We have an increasingly sophisticated understanding that the course of an infection in a patient has as much to do with the genetic makeup of that patent as much as it does the nature of the infecting organism. In the case of Human Immunodeficiency Virus a wide range of responses to infection have been observed. The usual course of the infection is that the virus damages the immune system over many years until the patient becomes vulnerable to infection from organisms that are normally harmless; these are opportunistic infections that characterise the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) which is caused by the HIV virus. There are however a small number of people called elite controllers (ECs) who seem never to develop any symptoms and at the other end of the spectrum are people who progress very rapidly to AIDS called Rapid Progressors (RPs).
 
Studying how genes differ between these groups of people may help us identify both the genes and the proteins that are encoded by genes, that are important either to help the body fight HIV or those that HIV can use to establish infection and spread. This in turn may help the design of drugs or vaccines which target those proteins.
 
Whilst this approach has been successful in ECs until now there has been relatively little research done on the genetic makeup of RPs. New advances in our ability to read DNA, the chemical which encodes our genetic information, called Next Generation Sequencing, mean that it is possible to quickly and cheaply gather a huge amount of genetic data and this is being done for RPs.
 
I am collaborating with the Sanger Institute in Cambridge who are in the process of analyzing the genes of a group of rapid progressors. In the first study of its kind they have already identified a series of genetic differences, also called polymorphisms, which seem to be associated with rapid progression.
 
I intend to investigate the first of these polymorphisms in Professor Greg Towers lab using the techniques and methods for which he is world renowned. Using genetic engineering technologies we will look at what happens to cells infect ed with HIV when they have the gene variation associated with rapid progression compared to normal cells. This will enable us to determine how the cell interacts with HIV. The protein encoded by this gene, called Ku80, has already been linked to HIV and there are good reasons to think that it might be involved in the way that cells detect viruses and then warm other cells. If this were true it would have wide ranging implications for all people infected with HIV not just rapid progressors. 

I believe that this kind of study, where genes are identified as being associated with a particular patient group and then studied in detail, will become increasingly important in years to come as our ability to read DNA gets faster and cheaper and it will become possible to give patients different prognoses and treatments according to their genetic makeup.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>I aim to investigate the molecular mechanisms of polymorphisms identified by GWAS and exome sequencing which are associated with rapid progression of HIV to AIDS. I will begin with a polymorphism in the XRCC-5 promoter that drives expression of the Ku80 protein a member of the non homologous end joining pathway (NHEJ). I will (1) use reporter gene assays to assess polymorphic promoter activity, I will clone the polymorphic XRCC5 promoter sequences into a plasmid such that they drive luciferase expression. I will then transfect a variety of cells and assess promoter activity by measuring luciferase activity. (2) I will seek differential transcription factor binding sites using electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). I will prepare radioactively labeled oligonucleotides encoding the polymorphic promoter sequences and incubate with nuclear extracts from human T cell lines and seek evidence for differential transcription factor binding to the different sequences. Factors will be identified by supershifting with specific antibodies. Candidates will be identified by inspection of publicly available ChIP Seq data which will inform us as to which transcription factors have been found to be bound to the XRCC5 promoter. (3) I will investigate the role of Ku 80 it's heterodimeric partner Ku70 and other members of the Non Homologous End Joining Pathway for a role in pathogen associated pattern recognition and HIV replication. I will reduce protein expression by expressing specific shRNA sequences and over-express proteins using lentiviral vectors. I will also make mutant proteins, particularly focusing on residues described to be under positive selection and express these proteins in T cell lines. I will then examine whether the ability of the cells to replicate HIV-1 and detect virus is altered by measuring interferon induced gene expression by quantitative PCR and expression array and HIV-1 replication by measurement of viral protein (p24) production.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>This fundamentally study has wide ranging implications for clinicians, immunosuppressed patients and the general public that could lead to the invention of novel diagnostic techniques (including sequencing the XRCC-5 promoter or other identified polymorphisms), identification of novel drug targets, and enhance the reputation of UK research. 

It is clear that both host and pathogen genotypes have a major impact on disease progression in infection and the use of next generation sequencing technology is going to be vital in elucidating these relationships. The exome study sequencing rapid progressors is the first of its kind and should pave the way for this technology being used to prognosticate for clinicians and patients not just in Rapid progressors with HIV but across all cohorts through defining the molecular basis for polymorphisms that impact on HIV progression to AIDS. Should this be the case our study will eventually form the basis for screening of HIV infected individuals to further test our hypothesis in larger numbers of patients and eventually allow the improvement of HIV disease management, prognosis and treatment. 

This application also describes a series of basic science experiments with a high discovery content. All anti-HIV drugs have been found though a thorough understanding of retroviral biology. New HIV drugs and a successful preventative HIV vaccine are similarly going to be based on the findings of basic research such as this. Thus this work together with that of colleagues will eventually underpin the design of vaccines and antiviral drug development. 

Importantly research into innate immune control of viral infection and the role of innate immunity in vaccine adjuvanting is a relatively new, exciting and very important area of research that has the opportunity to impact on our understanding of all areas of immune biology and viral pathogenesis.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-16</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-10</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>203659</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Cheltenham Science Festival</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5BD8A77F-ABBD-4816-B90C-3D5D7A5F5C56</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I gave 3 talks at the festival
