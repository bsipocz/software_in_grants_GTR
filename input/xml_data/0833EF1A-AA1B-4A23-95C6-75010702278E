Fiction</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/K004174/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This project will increase public engagement with digital fiction and provide empirically substantiated analyses to show how readers interact with digital fiction. Digital Fiction is fiction that is written for and read from a computer and can be Web- or app-based (for tablets and smartphones) or accessed via CD-ROMs. Digital fictions are different to e-books, however. Rather than existing as a digital version of a print novel, digital fictions are what are known as &amp;quot;born digital&amp;quot; - that is, they would lose something of their aesthetic and/or structural form and meaning if they were removed from the digital medium. For example, they may contain hyperlinks, moving images, mini-games or sound effects. Further, unlike e-books in which the reader moves from one page to another in a linear fashion, in many digital fictions, the reader has a role in constructing the narrative, either by selecting hyperlinks or by controlling a character's journey through the storyworld. Digital fictions therefore require that the reader interacts with the narrative throughout the reading experience. With the increasing availability and popularity of e-readers, such as the Kindle and associated iPad applications, e-books are increasingly being advertised, discussed and produced. Their cultural, social and economic significance is growing with print publishers now focussing much of their marketing effort in this area. As commercial products, e-readers are only available to those that can afford to buy them, but much digital fiction is available for free. While the move to e-publishing might suggest increased digital fluency and amplified general interest in digital textuality, public awareness of and engagement with born digital fiction remains relatively low. 

The project aims to raise public awareness of and engagement with digital fiction in order to permit a more inclusive engagement with these texts and, in a related step, increase digital literacies more broadly. In a series of public engagement activities in Sheffield, Bangor and Aberystwyth, readers will learn about born digital fiction. Their engagement with the texts will enhance digital literacies and encourage a more explicit understanding of narrative form and structure in general as well as awareness of how digital texts are different from print. This includes: how to identify and respond to different types of plot and narration in digital environments; how to read texts that utilise images, sound and interactive navigational elements; how to combine reading and gaming; how to use digital technologies critically. The project also aims to empirically test the researchers' analyses of digital fiction. Primarily the researchers will consider how readers process the multimodal aspects of digital fiction - that is, the combination of different modes such as sound, images and text. The researchers will also consider the relationship between what readers expect to happen in the narrative as a consequence of their actions and what they actually find. Finally the researchers will investigate whether different forms of narration affect the relationship between the reader of digital fiction and the fictional world that it describes. Using a range of data collection strategies including questionnaires, focus groups and interviews, reader response data will be gathered from workshop participants as well as more established readers of digital fiction who belong to established reading communities (e.g. members of the Electronic Literature Organisation) and incorporated into the researchers' analyses. The result will be a more robust and, crucially, empirically based understanding of how readers interact with digital fiction. This part of the project will also inform wider cognitive-linguistic theories of literature by providing a replicable methodology for testing reader engagement with digital texts and well as a deeper understanding of how readers interact with fictional narratives in general.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The main beneficiaries will be local people, public services and local organisations. Digital fiction workshops will be held at Bank Street Arts, Sheffield Library and the National Library of Wales in Aberystwyth during which attendees will read and discuss digital fiction. They will learn to read digital fiction as a multimodal experience and consider how its interactive elements affect their reading experience. While the workshops will provide a place for group discussion and one-to-one support, other events will allow participants to explore digital fiction in their own time. In Sheffield an exhibition of digital fiction will be held at Bank Street Arts Gallery and a digital fiction author will give a public lecture as part of the Off the Shelf literary festival. In Bangor, a digital fiction competition will be held as part of the new Arts and Innovations Centre (Pontio) cultural programme which is scheduled to open in early 2014 and a public launch will increase public awareness of this initiative. The geographical focus of this event is particularly significant because very few digital fictions have been published within Wales and/or in the Welsh language. Overall, all events will increase public awareness of and engagement with digital fiction within local public spaces but also pave the way for readers to explore this kind of fiction in their own time outside of these venues. 

The project will also widen participation in digital textuality, increase digital literacies and enhance comprehension of literary narratives because participants will be encouraged to reflect on digital fiction's status as: a complement to print, an electronic form of art and as a form of narrative fiction. Attendees will also be asked to consider digital fiction alongside other digital forms of media (e.g. social networking, news media) so as to reflect on digital fiction's place in our increasingly digital society. Digital literacy skills will be improved because attendees with different levels of technical experience and confidence will access these texts using computer technology. Professional practice will be influenced because the library-based facilitators will be trained in the use of digital fiction in reading groups. These activities will also increase use of the local facilities and contribute towards their economic prosperity by bringing in existing and new service users.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-07-03</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-06</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>194527</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The exhibition catalogue supported and complemented the physical exhibition, 'The Future of Reading?

The exhibition comprised three galleries which contained 27 works. Gallery 1 focused on the historical context of digital literature; Gallery 2 focused on different forms of interactivity; Gallery 3 focused on multimodality. Each station had descriptive texts about each of the works in the exhibition. Links to the Online version of the exhibition were included in the exhibition catalogue from which virtual visitors can experience the works outside of the gallery on their own devices.</gtr:description><gtr:id>745D418B-E0BF-4E47-A5B0-485AD1356DEB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Knowledge exchange took place between the gallery staff and the research team both in terms of subject matter (i.e. digital fiction) and creative and professional practice (e.g. how literature can be exhibited). Future collaborations are being planned as a result.

IT support staff at Sheffield Hallam University learned about digital fiction while preparing for and installing the exhibition.

Exhibition visitors learned about digital fiction and its place in literary history. Visitor feedback from the exhibition will also be used to design research methodologies for the reader-response study.

This immersive digital fiction, WALLPAPER, was not directly funded by the AHRC as part of the Reading Digital Fiction project funds. It was funded by Sheffield Hallam University Higher Education Innovation Fund and via the artists' Arts Council England funding, with support from Bank Street Arts and Bangor University. It was, however, developed as a direct result of the AHRC-funded Reading Digital Fiction project and also forms part of the Reading Digital Fiction empirical research on immersion and multimodality in digital fiction.

The exhibition was one of three central exhibitions in the Opening Up the Book Programme: 

The gallery staff were asked to provide feedback as to how the exhibition had effected their professional practice. Overall the gallery staff thought the exhibition was an 'outstanding addition to Bank Street Arts'. When asked what the gallery as a whole got out of the project, the Creative Directory of the gallery responded that the WALLPAPER project 'offered the opportunity to have a purpose designed work installed, created and built for the gallery itself - a cutting edge piece that is quite unlike anything staged anywhere else in the city this year or in many other years; The income and funding to do justice to the work and learn the lessons of staging a very complex set up; Further reinforcement of our standing in staging hybrid work; 
The opportunity to actively and directly participate in research as a real partner rather that just added on for staging purposes - I think this is one of the key successes of the project.'</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>543694b7372540.85259445-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Curatorial support has been contributed by the Creative Director and Centre Manager at Bank Street Arts.

Informed by the PI and Co-I's research on immersion and multimodality in digital fiction, Dreaming Methods, Bank Street Arts Gallery, and the PI and Co-I from the Reading Digital Fiction project team devised a concept for installing a new digital work, called WALLPAPER, written by Dreaming Methods. 

WALLPAPER was developed via funding from Sheffield Hallam University Higher Education Innovation Fund (reported on in 'Further Funding') and an Arts Council, England 'Grants for the Arts' grant of &amp;pound;12,618 which was awarded to One-to-One Development Trust (March 2015-March 2016). 

The premier of WALLPAPER and the associated exhibition was held at Bank Street Arts in Sheffield from 12th November to 5th December 2015. The installation was also supported by a series of public events including reading groups and artists' talk.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>'Introducing Digital Fiction' public workshop at Sheffield Library</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>59ECF892-6E13-4062-8FAB-0A3CB2C5F311</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Members of the public were invited to join a researcher-led discussion about a work of digital fiction in Sheffield Central Library.

The session was included in the Off the Shelf literary festival programme which is an annual event that takes place in Sheffield.

All of the participants reported an increase in knowledge and awareness of digital fiction; likewise, they all reported an increase in their confidence in using digital media. In addition, they all felt that they learned something new during the session regarding interactivity, the cybernetic feedback loop, and digital fiction as a medium.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5433fc8dc39193.32248057</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://readingdigitalfiction.com/events/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Online Exhibition of Digital Literature</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>31CE8A7F-A5F2-44A0-BAF4-66299EE721C1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The online exhibition complements and archives the physical exhibition, 'The Future of Reading?

The Artwalk is an established and growing alternative night out that exists to showcase local, national, and international talent in a whole range of settings. Project collaborators, Judi Alston and Andy Campbell of One-to-One Development Trust, hosted participants. They gave an introduction to the project, linking the installation to the Reading Digital Fiction project research explicitly. 

109 people went on the Artwalk, and they were enthusiastic in their response to the WALLPAPER installation: &amp;quot;Brilliant. Very realistic. Freaked me out, in a good way&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;I felt like I was in one of my dreams&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;Very interesting and much more exciting and enjoyable than expected&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;Wow. That was mint!&amp;quot;; and &amp;quot;Absolutely fantastic - really immersive virtual worlds.&amp;quot;

A number of people were also interested in continuing their experience beyond the installation: &amp;quot;Love the narrative-driven gameplay. Where do you download this from?&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;Unique and at times unsettling. I'd definitely play this at home&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;Interesting use of narrative, creepy atmosphere. Love the soundtrack. Is this on STEAM?&amp;quot;; and &amp;quot;Would definitely be interested in seeing how this develops&amp;quot;.

The novelty of the digital fiction and virtual reality format were widely acknowledged as well: &amp;quot;A new genre of artistic creativity&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;Staggeringly brilliant. New and exciting&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;Really cool and innovative projects&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;Loved the VR headset experiences&amp;quot;; and &amp;quot;Clever, I can see how you are bringing stories to life&amp;quot;. 

Finally, one participant praised the WALLPAPER installation's &amp;quot;Excellent approach for getting people engaged with storytelling, wider concepts and art&amp;quot;.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b30de0057460.55161240</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.the-arthouse.org.uk/event/131/artwalk-open-studio-tours-and-events</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Article on Reading Digital Fiction in The Sheffield Telegraph newspaper</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>953EFC20-66A6-4542-ADDF-E45DCDE1EE4E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>An article about the Reading Digital Fiction project and associated public engagement activities (exhibition and book club) was published in The Sheffield Telegraph on 17 October 2014.

This immersive digital fiction, WALLPAPER was not directly funded by the AHRC as part of the Reading Digital Fiction project funds. It was funded by Sheffield Hallam University Higher Education Innovation Fund and via the artists' Arts Council England funding, with support from Bank Street Arts and Bangor University. It was, however, developed as a direct result of the AHRC-funded Reading Digital Fiction project and also forms part of the Reading Digital Fiction empirical research.

The WALLPAPER digital fiction installation ran from 13 November to 5 December 2015 at Bank Street Arts, Sheffield, UK. The installation formed a central part of Bank Street Arts' project 'Opening Up the Book' (http://openingupthebook.com/category/november/), being promoted as one of three central exhibitions in the programme. It aimed to increase public awareness of and engagement with digital fiction via a collaboration with the One-to-One Development Trust and specifically their Dreaming Methods initiative. It also aims to understand how new media art and digital fiction in particular can be best exhibited in a public art space. The project resulted in a site specific digital fiction installation as well as a programme of supporting public engagement events (reported on in other sections).

Responses to the exhibition were collected using an IPad positioned at the door of the gallery. 35 people responded. When asked what will you do in response to the exhibition? 94% (all but two) comments were positive: 'thanks for the inspiration'; 'congratulate the creators'; 'since I'm fascinated with the expedition [sic] I would like to see more digital fiction'. Many visitors (31%) were inspired to look at or make more digital fiction or recommend the exhibition to others (23%). When asked 'Is there anything else you'd like to say about the exhibition?', most visitors (65%) left a positive comment in this space, for example: 'like nothing else!'; 'I want more!'; 'Lovely atmosphere, amazing landscapes, brilliant attention to detail'. 

A comprehensive evaluation of the WALLPAPER exhibition and supporting events will be published on the Reading Digital Fiction website (www.readingdigitalfiction.com) in April 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56def32695a6f2.42921579</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://bankstreetarts.com/exhibitions/wallpaper/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Reading Digital Fiction website</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8195F69E-DAE0-41B2-96B3-0018AC387085</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In 2016, the Reading Digital Fiction website had 9,761 views from 5,672 unique visitors.

This was co-delivered with Judi Alston and Andy Campbell of One-to-One Development Trust. Eighteen participants explored the origins and future of digital fiction, including a historical tour of digital fiction from its origins in 'Choose-Your-Own-Adventure books' through to experiments in hypertext to videogames and apps, and the hopes and fears that digital technology bring to the future of writing. Attendees were invited to ask questions and to debate the issues explored in the research talk. The participants were also invited to experience WALLPAPER, an immersive digital fiction installation set in the North Yorkshire Moors.

Participants enjoyed the workshop, particularly the audience interactions that arose after the initial lecture and demonstration: &amp;quot;the conversations the talk and demo inspired were very interesting, very thought-provoking&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;triggering discussions about hopes and fears&amp;quot;; and &amp;quot;challenging my views on storytelling&amp;quot;.

The experience of the WALLPAPER installation was also popular with participants: &amp;quot;the practical use of the game--VR was brilliant&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;loved trying out the tech and learning about VR&amp;quot;; and &amp;quot;introducing me to the WALLPAPER work [was the most successful aspect of the event]&amp;quot;.

The participants recorded the session themselves, and they were asked by the RDF researchers to focus their discussion on the following: the main character (Karen), their relationship with Karen, and the experience of interacting with the story on their mobile phones. These areas were developed by the RDF in relation to their research on immersion and multimodality in digital fiction. 
In addition to the questions for the empirical study, participants were also asked two general feedback questions.
When asked 'What influence will this session have on your reading choices in future (if any)?', four out of five participants replied that that they were more open to reading more digital fiction. One replied that they did not regard the experience as 'reading'. When asked 'What are you taking away from this session?', the participants all declared that they were inspired by the experience to start their own discussion club in they they would discuss books, films, theatre or other kind of media themselves. One participant remarked that 'I found it particularly enjoyable to sit down with a group of people I know really well, and discuss something in a more structured way than we would normally.' Another participant came away with the 'realisation that different people take different things away from the same text'.
Overall, the feedback showed that participants had a positive experience with digital fiction, with the research process, and were eager to find more to read in the future as well as to discuss and reflect on cultural experiences more generally.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d47858b7b316.27527482</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>WALLPAPER Artists' Talk</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A2257D12-E17F-4B09-A406-D1D2B0960EDC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>16 people attended an artists' talk by Judi Alston and Andy Campbell (of One-to-One Development Trust's Dreaming Methods).

The exhibition was included in the Off the Shelf literary festival programme in Sheffield.

General admission to the exhibition (excluding tours, student groups, and launch event) = 340 (Week 1: 200; Week 2: 50; Week 3: 90). Average attendance for an exhibition at Bank Street is between 10 and 20 people per day and thus 40-80 per week. 

To evaluate the exhibition, a feedback form was distributed to attendees. 66 people completed a feedback form. 84% of respondents said that their knowledge of digital fiction had increased after seeing the exhibition. 88% of those that responded (to this particular question) felt more confident using digital media after experiencing the exhibition. 78% of those that responded (to this particular question) felt that their experience of the exhibition influenced their understanding of reading and literature in the twenty-first century. Comments included: 'Made me realise the versatility of storytelling, something I'd never considered before.'; 'I am so happy to see a focus on this work. Exactly the sort of real/placed approach to research that is needed.'; 'It has completely opened my eyes to a whole new world of literature.'

38 people attended, 21 attendees completed a feedback questionnaire. 90% reported that their knowledge of digital fiction had increased as a consequence of attending the session - many indicating that their knowledge had increased from 'none' to 'a lot'. 86% reported that the talk had 'influenced their understanding of reading and literature in the 21st century'; 14% did not answer that question. Comments about the session included: 'I'll be looking out for the other events'; 'it was brilliant!'; 'what an absolute pleasure to have a writer of this calibre'; 'it was excellent and thought-provoking - very creative'. Several respondents reported that they would attend other events about digital fiction and one indicated that they would 'be very interested in participating in any future research - this is fascinating'.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>542294a04b9852.69364270</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.showroomworkstation.org.uk/digitalfiction</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Feature in The Sheffield Star newspaper</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7D29A78D-4BA7-4E24-A4AE-275038301564</gtr:id><gtr:impact>An article about the Reading Digital Fiction project and associated public engagement activities (exhibition and book club) was published in The Sheffield Star on 17 October 2014.

Some of the participants reported feeling more confident about using digital media after the session, and they all plan to seek out other forms of digital fiction. Two of the participants had already attended other events in our public engagement programme (the Curator-led Guided Tour of the Exhibition and the Kate Pullinger Lecture), so this session helped to reinforce their interest in digital fiction.

Through a launch event, gallery installation and exciting talk/workshop, readers were invited to explore an atmospheric 3D storyworld set in the remote North Yorkshire moors, uncovering a family history of unfulfilled hopes and hidden fears. 

More than 150 people experienced the installation and the associated events in the Wakefield region. Many of the audience members reflected positively on their encounter with digital fiction, especially in the context of the wider community: &amp;quot;It's interesting to see the lengths people are going to to get involved in different disciplines, so bringing together the writing, illustrating, drawing, filmmaking, storytelling, and promoting that to a wider audience can only be a positive thing&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;I didn't know how long it would take to put together a digital fiction story and how much of a wide community got involved with it&amp;quot;; and &amp;quot;I think it's interesting to have a conversation about [digital fiction], and [this event] has given me the opportunity to talk with people in the field&amp;quot;.

N.B. The original version of WALLPAPER (2015) was developed as a direct result of the AHRC-funded Reading Digital Fiction project and also forms part of the Reading Digital Fiction empirical research on immersion and multimodality in digital fiction.

The tour contextualised the works in the exhibition and allowed students to interact with the works.

9 students completed a feedback questionnaire. 78% reported an increase in knowledge about digital fiction and 12% reported no change. In the qualitative comments, 100% of attendees reported that they had learned something new from the exhibition. When asked whether they felt more confident about using digital media after experiencing the exhibition, 78% reported an increase in confidence and 12% reported no change. Asked whether the exhibition has 'influenced your understanding of reading and literature in the 21st century?' 78% answered positively and 12% did not respond to the question. Qualitative comments included 'It has made me think about the types of experimental literature you don't often hear about when looking at literature'; 'the exhibition has put literature in the 21st century in historical context'; 'it has opened my eyes to more kinds of digital fiction'; 'fun - like the gallery!'; 'literature can be more like a game'. 

44% of attendees were based in Sheffield; 56% of attendees were based outside Sheffield.

Building on the success of the immersive large-scale projection of WALLPAPER in Sheffield in 2015, this new version was a complete virtual reality experience using Oculus Rift and Gear VR. In addition to being able to enjoy the immersive digital experience, attendees were also able to meet the team behind the pioneering project - Andy Campbell and Judi Alston (Dreaming Methods and One to One Development Trust), and Principal Investigator Dr Alice Bell and Researcher Dr Isabelle van der Bom - and discuss the project research including empirical findings.

Many of the attendees provided feedback via audio interviews and paper questionnaires. Most of the attendees were new to digital fiction and virtual reality, and they all reported enjoying the installation: &amp;quot;using the headset was very impressive&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;first time using a VR headset -- the concept and execution is cool&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;from what I can see and the reactions I've heard it's so amazing&amp;quot;. One attendee was nine years old, and she learned &amp;quot;how to work a headset and how people reyact [sic]&amp;quot;.

Encouragingly, several people also praised the accessible and friendly nature of the event: &amp;quot;it widens your view, because you think 'this could well be mainstream' rather than just a gimmicky thing&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;it's great to see events open to the general public, also excellent that artists and creative practitioners are involved&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;anything that widens people's experience is a good thing&amp;quot;; and &amp;quot;it's really good to get out of the ivory tower of academia and connect with the general public, and I think these kinds of events really help towards that&amp;quot;.

Finally, the event increased understanding of digital fiction as well: &amp;quot;I think it's very enlightening, especially for somebody like me who knows nothing about it whatsoever&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;I'm more aware of it. I now know digital fiction is in more places than we know&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;I didn't know how long it would take to put together a digital fiction story and how much of a wide community got involved with it&amp;quot;; and &amp;quot;Yes, it's improved my knowledge of digital fiction.

Seventeen Community Liaison Librarians attended the event, during which they were introduced to digital fiction and asked about how it might be used with the library service users.

Several participants suggested that young people's reading groups associated with the library would find digital fiction useful for introducing younger people to literature. One librarian asked for support with using digital fiction with a child and parent reading group and a meeting was held in January 2015 to discuss that. An event with young children and families will take place in April 2015 to introduce them to digital fictions and offer them resources for using digital fiction in the library and at home.

As a result of working with the Reading Digital Fiction project, one of the community librarians was invited to attend a meeting for people who have an interest in technology / digital / creative activity within Sheffield, particularly in relation to children, young people and families. She is therefore developing her work in that area as a direct result of working on the RDF project. 

Another librarian suggested using the multi-lingual fictions with library patrons learning other languages.

It was also agreed that the Reading Digital Fiction project would produce material for the 'Reading Room', which is an online resource for individuals and reading groups so that librarians can direct service users and assist them with reading as required. (The URL is included below.)

The project team learned about the range of library service users and which of those might be interested in digital fiction. They were given access to lists of reading groups who might take part in the empirical research. The project team learned about what kind of information about digital fiction would be useful to library service users.

Before the session, the librarians were asked, 'How much do you know about digital fiction?'. Eighteen percent answered 'none', 73% answered 'a little', and 9% answered 'some'. After the session, 21% answered 'a lot', 29% answered 'some', and 21% answered 'a little'.

After the session, all of the librarians either agreed (57%) or strongly agreed (43%) with the statement 'I enjoyed today's session', and all but one agreed (57%) or strongly agreed (36%) with the statement 'I learned something new and valuable at today's session'. 

The librarians' comments reflected their new appreciation and understanding of digital fiction: 'Before today's session I thought it was just another ebook. [It is] far more atmospheric and visual than I imagined it would be'; 'I was totally amazed by [the story]. I have learned not to be afraid of digital fiction'; and 'I didn't realise there was so much digital fiction available and it was interesting to see how interactive the stories were'. The majority of librarians (64%) said they would seek out more digital fiction to read in the future, and 71% said they would promote it to specific user groups within the library.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54203ef9ab5343.95687257</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.sheffield.gov.uk/libraries/readingroom/a-good-read/digitalfiction.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Opening Up Digital Fiction writing competition</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0EF67E2C-BC46-4239-B07A-CA3F91B95382</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Principal Investigator Dr Alice Bell and Co-Investigator Dr Lyle Skains organised a competition for new pieces of digital fiction in Welsh and English. 

The the Opening Up Digital Fiction Writing Competition is designed to expand digital fiction readership to include a broader segment of the public. Therefore while the competition was open to all writers (rookies and veterans) and all types of digital fiction, we sought entries of works that are broadly accessible, both in terms of intended audience and device compatibility. This is the first ever digital fiction competition which aimed to produce &amp;quot;popular&amp;quot; works of digital fiction.

The prize categories were: 

Judges' Prize
People's Choice
Welsh Language Prize*
Student Prize
Children's Story Prize
*Welsh language entries are eligible for all prize categories.

Winners will receive a cash prize (&amp;pound;300 to the winner of each category), publication on the Reading Digital Fiction website, and a series of mentoring meetings with select judges on a future digital fiction project. 

The competition was widely publicised to writers and the general public through a variety of channels, including print media, radio, and the internet. 112 entries were received, one of which was in Welsh. The entries came from all over the world, including the USA, Canada, Nigeria, Switzerland, France, India, and the UK.
 
The judging has not yet taken place, and the awards ceremony will be held on 25 May 2017, so this year's entry is incomplete.

Attendees included members of the public, artists involved in creating the work, digital fiction writers, gallery staff, academic colleagues, and some press. The PI, Alice Bell, and the authors of WALLPAPER, Judi Alston and Andy Campbell, gave presentations, outlining the aims of the exhibition and the collaborative process. Average attendance figures for a launch event at Bank Street Arts are approximately 40 people, so this event represents a strong success comparably. Feedback was gathered via a 'visitors' book'.

The master class began with an introduction to digital fiction which was underpinned by research, followed by an exploration of how digital storytelling is different from writing for the traditional print medium. The participants were then introduced to digital writing software and given the opportunity to write some digital fiction themselves. The workshop concluded with a short exposition of what the participants had achieved.

The participants left feedback via paper questionnaires and as comments on the Reading Digital Fiction project website. All of the participants reported that their knowledge of digital fiction increased after attending the workshop. All of the participants also mentioned that being introduced to the specific software packages, including Twine and CopperCube, was the most significant thing they learned during the day.

Many of the participants felt more confident about using digital media in their own writing, and a few of them had specific plans: &amp;quot;I would like to use it for residential care home residents to create memory box stories&amp;quot;; and &amp;quot;I don't usually use images in my work, but this has prompted me to consider doing this more&amp;quot;. Experienced practitioners of digital media also benefited from the session: &amp;quot;I was already confident with digital media, but the workshop helped me understand how easy it would be to get started with a new method&amp;quot;.

With support from Alice Bell, Anne devised a session using child friendly computer hardware and resources from a variety digital fiction resources. PI, Alice Bell, delivered the session with Anne.
Nineteen families, with children under 5, attended the event and the majority reported knowing more about digital fiction after the session.
This session achieved a number of different aims, including providing a taster day to showcase alternative book sharing ideas available in libraries to parents and children; demonstrating how digital technology can support learning; promoting safe use of new technologies; and increasing awareness and access of sites available.
Most of the families were quite positive about their experience of the workshop: 67% said their child enjoyed the experience and 56% were surprised at the range of websites available. A few comments from parents included 'Both children loved looking at the books on the computer, they were extremely engaged throughout', 'I think it's a great idea', and 'useful to know about the story book websites'. 
Anne Frost, the Sheffield Central Libraries Early Years facilitator, appreciated the chance to work with the Reading Digital Fiction project team and liaise with the university. She also welcomed 'the chance to ask our users what they would like from us and what they expect from us. It demonstrated how we are keen to learn how we can develop the service in the future'. Furthermore, she has planned some pilot sessions using digital fiction to help children with the new computer sciences national curriculum.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d6eaa930ad55.41643571</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://readingdigitalfiction.com/2015/04/24/digital-fiction-and-toddler-readers-at-sheffield-childrens-library/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Site-specific exhibition pop-up book club (WALLPAPER)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C36A48CF-3B3D-4C9D-A85D-3803D0C3775A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Members of the public were invited to participate in a pop-up book club at Bank Street Arts, where the site-specific piece of digital fiction Wallpaper was being exhibited. While 6 people signed up for the event, only two participants attended on the night. (We suspect this was due to bad weather as well as the normal drop-out rate.) The session was led by PI Dr Alice Bell and Co-I Prof Astrid Ensslin and questions informed by their research on immersion, multimodality, and interactivity in digital fiction. The two discussion centred largely on the two participants' experience of the work, feelings of immersion, and the boundaries between digital fiction and literary games.
When asked 'What influence will this session have on your reading choices in future (if any)?', both participants responded with comments including 'wanting to explore more digital fiction' and 'considering what it means to 'be' in a digital fiction'.
When asked 'What are you taking away from this session?', participants had mixed reactions, with one wanting to 'look for more digital fiction but not game ones' while another expressed an interest in 'reading more 'game-like' narratives'. Both participants asked to be kept informed of the research outcomes, suggested a sustained interest beyond the discussion group setting.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d437501240b7.76162965</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://readingdigitalfiction.com/events/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Digital fiction sessions (x 3) with established reading groups (WALLPAPER)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6884FCFF-381F-4B62-A05C-E9A4E4B3F932</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Members of three local reading groups were invited to attend an exhibition of a site-specific installation of digital fiction entitled WALLPAPER. After everyone had read the piece on their own, they met in the gallery and participated in a researcher-led discussion of their experience of reading the work, which was based on research on multimodalty and immersion by the Reading Digital Fiction project. The discussion included their responses to the story and characters, their feelings of immersion, and the physical gallery setting.
In addition to discussing the digital fiction installation, participants were also asked to evaluate the experience. They reported that the sessions had a significant impact on future reading choices; ten of the twelve participants said they would read more digital fiction. Three participants wanted to come back and try WALLPAPER again. Overall, the comments show how the session expanded readers' knowledge of digital fiction, and how participants gained 'a more open approach to different mediums' in general.
When asked 'What influence will this session have on your reading choices in future (if any)?', participants responded with comments such as 'had not thought there may be different genre before I came', 'I'll keep an eye open for more digital fiction, especially of the non-horror/suspense variety', and 'I would sign up for a monthly 'here are some interesting new dig fics' newsletter'.
When asked 'What are you taking away from this session?', participants replied with 'reflections on the nature of reading and gender differences in approaches to fiction and video games', 'a willingness to try more interactive fiction (where I am in control and expected to react)', and 'a lovely memory of a fine conversation and a richer understanding of the work'.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d46af9cf6939.59755406</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://readingdigitalfiction.com/2016/02/05/reading-wallpaper-at-bank-street-arts/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Reading Digital Fiction Resources for Readers</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8F56225E-E211-462F-989E-42D6611FDF04</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Reading Digital Fiction project team has created a number of resources to engage different audiences with digital fiction.

Two highlights of the public impact generated by the Reading Digital Fiction project arose from exhibitions at Bank Street Arts, an independent gallery and studio complex in Sheffield, and sessions coordinated with the Sheffield Public Library Services. John Clark, director of Bank Street Arts, credits the sustained collaboration with the Reading Digital Fiction project with helping Bank Street &amp;quot;still exist, because I don't think it would have existed without it.

We invite readers from established reading groups who are comfortable with engaging in honest, critical discussions with each other to read a given piece of digital fiction in their own time. At the group session, the researcher leads a discussion of the salient aspects of the fiction to ensure that the research objectives are answered. Our method is more formal and less spontaneous than traditional (aka 'naturalistic') reading group sessions where the researcher is absent, but given the difficulty of addressing the navigational and interface issues that often appear in reader-response studies of digital fiction, our method provides us with clearer, more fruitful data. We have collected data from one pilot group, one pop-up group, and three further established reading groups, which we are analysing now.</gtr:description><gtr:id>97C3FAB9-4E8B-4EBB-AFB4-EC3E750FB3FA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As we only finished data collection in November 2015, it has not yet had any academic impact outside our project, but we expect that it will generate impact after the analysis is complete.

The research methodology has had impact on participants in the study and in particular their understanding of and confidence with digital fiction, their desire to read more digital fiction, and their enjoyment of discussion fiction with others.

For our study, we have firstly brought together and synthesised a variety of different theoretical typologies on hyperlinks and their functions in digital texts. Secondly, we designed a new methodology which synthesises those different typologies in one framework. With this methodology, we created a text that incorporated the different variety of hyperlinks. We then set up an empirical reader-response study in order to measure the way that readers interpret hyperlinks in digital fiction. From our designed text, we chose a limited number of hyperlinks to act as stimuli. Similarly to our reader-response methodology for analysing second person in digital fiction, participants were asked a series of questions for each stimulus. After the structured reading, the researcher conducted a structured interview to allow the participants to reflect on the experience of reading the story and following the hyperlinks throughout.</gtr:description><gtr:id>446358BA-7DEE-43F9-8347-90748F86212F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The data for this study has been gathered, and the researchers will use cognitive poetics and narratology to explain the results.

In this case, our primary material is an app-fiction that takes ten days for readers to experience the full story. Information they enter and choices they make each day influence the next day's section of story. 

We invite groups of friends to begin the app on the same day and to have a group discussion after they have all finished the app. There are no researchers present at the final discussion, but a 'group leader' is appointed who audio-records the session and sets out the general topics as provided by the researchers. Participants are invited to reflect on the story experience as a whole (i.e. the story itself and also the experience of experiencing the story on their mobile phones); the main character; their relationship to the main character; and anything else they'd like to talk about.

As of March 2017, we have collected data from one group with more to follow in April-July 2017.</gtr:description><gtr:id>EE4DE715-F9B8-4F2E-9739-47BF123DD267</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As we have collected data from only one group thus far, and we have not had a chance to analyse the data, there are no notable academic impacts to report yet.

The piece of digital fiction was a site-specific multimedia installation in a purpose-built space within in an art gallery. The participants were informed that the general aim of the study was to explore immersion, but they were not given any further direction to influence their interpretation. We aimed for a high degree of ecological validity in which reader responses were gathered in their original setting with minimal input from researchers, and we did not manipulate the textual stimulus in any way (which would be expected with the 'experimental' approach). 
All of the sessions were audio recorded, transcribed, and subsequently coded in nVivo.</gtr:description><gtr:id>739489D9-4985-46AF-8D7D-F221D5CB4319</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As the analysis of the data has not yet been completed, this methodology has not yet been provided to other research groups, nor has it had any notable impact.

In a hands-on orientation session, we present a brief introduction to the medium of digital fiction and give participants the chance to read several pieces of digital fiction on their own computers. For the study itself, we set up a series of screenshots from a piece of digital fiction in a way that closely mimics the experience they would have if they read it on the live web. This allows us to have a controlled stimulus set while preserving the experience of reading the digital fiction in its native format. In several of the screenshots, we ask participants to identify 'you' on a cline from &amp;quot;'you' = me the reader&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;'you' = a fictional character&amp;quot;. Depending on their answers, participants are asked a series of set questions for each stimulus. After the structured reading, the researcher conducts a structured interview to allow the participant to reflect on her experience of reading the story and being addressed in second person throughout. Once the data is gathered and analysed for trends and anomalies, the researchers will use Cognitive Discourse Analysis (Tenbrink, 2015), cognitive poetics, and narratological approaches to explain the results.
