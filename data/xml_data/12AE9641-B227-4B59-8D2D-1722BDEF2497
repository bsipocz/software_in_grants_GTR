These barriers are important for maintaining the normal function of the Central Nervous System (CNS) and the Peripheral Nervous System (PNS) and disruption of the barriers is associated with diseases as diverse as cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, neuropathies and stroke. In the CNS, which includes the brain and spinal cord, the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) is fairly well described and consists of three main cell types. Endothelial cells that form the blood vessels themselves and pericytes and astrocytes that wrap around the endothelial cells to completely cover their outer surface. The endothelial cells provide the main barrier function. They do this by having specialised tight junctions between them that stop molecules passing between them. They also have low levels of transcytosis, a mechanism by which molecules can be transported through a cell. These properties are induced by the environment of the CNS and it is known that signals from pericytes and astrocytes regulate distinct aspects of the BBB. Because of the barrier the endothelial cells express special transporters that enable the passage of molecules into and out of the CNS that are needed for brain function. One effect of some efflux transporters is that they can provide a block to the uptake of drugs into the CNS and this has been a major hindrance to the delivery of drugs to the brain.
In contrast the Blood Nerve Barrier (BNB) that protects the PNS is poorly characterised. It is known to be different from the BBB, in its permeability and it must be made of different cell types, as astrocytes for example do not exist in the PNS. However, as the BBB protects the brain, the BNB it is known to be important for the health of our nerves and disruption is associated with pathologies that cause nerve damage, pain and cancer. Differences to the BBB however, may explain why certain drugs such as taxol and other drugs known to treat cancer cause damage mainly to the PNS.
The aim of this proposed study is to characterise the structure of the BNB, determine the molecules responsible for its formation and identify how it can be regulated. Using a range of cutting-edge microscopy techniques, we will establish the anatomy of the BNB from the tissue to the molecular level. We will also define the characteristics of the distinct aspects of BNB permeability. We will then perform a molecular analysis to determine which genes are important in defining the barrier and which signals confer distinct properties of the barrier. Finally we will determine how it can be regulated and relate these findings to pathologies of the PNS. We have developed a mouse model in which signals from another cell type in the nerve, Schwann cells, can reversibly breakdown the BNB is a manner that is relevant to the normal injury response. This will give us an extremely powerful system in which to study the temporal reversible regulation of the barrier in the absence of injury or other complex pathologies. It should also enable us to identify how signals from Schwann cells regulate the BNB and whether these mechanisms are relevant to pathologies of the PNS. In the long-term, we hope that these studies will result in new treatments for disorders of the PNS and possibly also the CNS.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Technical summary
A specialised vasculature, the Blood Nerve Barrier (BNB) protects the Peripheral Nervous System (PNS) whereas its breakdown is associated with injury and pathologies such as cancer and diabetic and inflammatory neuropathies. Unlike the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB), it is poorly characterised with little known about its structure, properties and regulation. It is different to the BBB however, in its permeability and it must be different in its structure and how it is regulated, as some of the cell types that confer barrier function in the BBB do not exist in the PNS. Some of the differences in barrier function between the BBB and the BNB may explain why some drugs, such as taxol, preferentially affect the PNS. We have recently developed a mouse model in which signals from Schwann cells in the PNS cause the breakdown of the BNB in a manner related to the normal injury response. This provides a powerful model to study how the BNB can be regulated and to identify the signaling mechanisms responsible. 
In order to systematically define the BNB and determine how is can be regulated and examine the relevance of these process to disease we will do the following:
1. Using a number of advanced microscopic techniques, including 3D EM, super-resolution microscopy and light-sheet microscopy we will determine the structure, nature and development of the Blood Nerve Barrier (BNB).
2. Determine the BNB transcriptome and characterise molecules important for distinct aspects of BNB function
3. Using our mouse model, we will determine the cell and molecular changes associated with the breakdown and reformation of the barrier and identify the signals responsible for regulating these changes. These findings will be related to pathologies of the PNS including relevant cancers and neuropathies.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Impact Summary
The impact of our findings is potentially very high. 
- Firstly, as so little is known about the structure and regulation of the Blood Nerve Barrier (BNB) our studies will provide the groundwork for all future studies. The research described in this proposal will provide a detailed structural and molecular analysis of the cells that contribute to the barrier that should provide the first insights into how the barrier functions. Moreover, we have a unique model system to study how the barrier function can be regulated. This model system is arguably more powerful than anything available for studying either the BNB or the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) and there is likely to be parallels between the two barriers.
- Identification of the mechanisms involved could potentially lead to increased understanding of the barrier breakdown associated with many pathologies and potentially to the development of drugs capable of controlling barrier function. Disruption of the barrier has been associated with many disorders such as neuropathies commonly associated with diabetes and cancer. The barrier may also act as a barrier to drug delivery to peripheral nerves. 
- Distinct properties of the BNB may explain why drugs such as taxol preferentially cause neuropathies in the PNS. This is a major problem in cancer treatment. A greater understanding of the BNB may assist in overcoming these debilitating side-effects 
- We will use and develop a number of innovative microscopy technologies relevant for the study of complex mammalian tissues. These include the use and development of advanced microscopy techniques such as Light sheet microscopy to visualise deep into mammalian tissues and super-resolution and 3D EM to study tissues at greater levels of resolution. The development of these microscopy techniques for tissues will be of use to other groups at the MRC LMCB and the broader scientific community.
- We will develop tractable primary mammalian co-culture systems to mimic BNB function in vitro. This should reduce animal use in the future and provide a higher-throughput model for testing future therapeutics.
- This work is likely to open a whole new field of research, as there is so little known in this research area. Ilaria Napoli is a senior postdoctoral fellowship and the aim of this project is to lay the groundwork for this new field of study. Ilaria would then aim to commence her research group in this important new field of research and hence establish herself rapidly as the leader of this exciting field. 
- The research described here will facilitate collaborations with researchers interested in neuropathies, cancer, diabetes and tissue imaging and analysis.
- Impact on increasing public awareness and understanding of science will be achieved through a host of initiatives, that will include press release through the UCL press office, participation in workshops aimed at lay audience and to open days organized by the LMCB and UCL.
- The commercialization and exploitation of scientific discoveries generated by the research described in this application are a priority. Upon identification of molecules that can regulate the BNB, I will contact the UCL business office and MRCT to further explore potential sources of funding, industrial partners and to protect the commercialization of the discovery. 
- Impact on patients affected and the public at risk of developing relevant disorders. In the longer term, following identification of the mechanisms regulating barrier function, we will assess their relevance in disorders associated with both the PNS and the CNS. Any impact on this sector is beyond the immediate scope of this proposal, however it will still provide an important step towards techniques for understanding, preventing and treating these disorders.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>534546</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>702F54D1-727B-4A4D-93B9-F0C652A3B06C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Sox2 expression in Schwann cells inhibits myelinationand induces influx of macrophages to the nerve.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Development (Cambridge, England)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f71f985b10e712ef5bc14edc12dc01e2"><gtr:id>f71f985b10e712ef5bc14edc12dc01e2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Roberts SL</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0950-1991</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a95743b134ca8.37880602</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C825DF97-FE38-4F8B-A353-0B6505CDAADD</gtr:id><gtr:title>Editorial overview: Glial biology.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Current opinion in neurobiology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f074ebb32d2f5a4ce22dfd887331cd80"><gtr:id>f074ebb32d2f5a4ce22dfd887331cd80</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lloyd AC</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0959-4388</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a9574118c67c2.96316778</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6365CF64-1C9E-4F28-BBF6-8932BEE4F13F</gtr:id><gtr:title>The multicellular complexity of peripheral nerve regeneration.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Current opinion in neurobiology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b1fd023ab4e2cea84d3d9e39b09f5d8f"><gtr:id>b1fd023ab4e2cea84d3d9e39b09f5d8f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cattin AL</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0959-4388</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58ab0dc6e86bc2.58404274</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/N009169/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>041997EB-CFD8-493D-B0F8-DFA35451D0BE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Neurological</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>CF950C9A-DB16-4E23-8AEB-94548777BCA1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>1.1  Normal biological development and functioning</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
