Chapter 1, 'Traditional Music in Irish Modernity,' explores, with respect to the development of 'traditional music' over the previous three centuries, the themes of modernity and tradition. The chapter argues that traditional music is essentially modern, though it is a particularly conservative articulation of modernity, emphasizing continuity, age, stable senses of place and identity. Chapter 2, 'Musical Identity and Nation during the Irish Revival,' is based on my research of public discourse on music during the Irish revival in newspapers and journals from the 1880s to the Great War. I explore the relationship of music to the 'literary' revival of these decades, and the efforts to 'de-Anglicize' Irish music by identifying and removing foreign influences that distorted the pure tradition. The attempt to achieve an improbable harmony between the music favoured by the disappearing Anglo-Irish aristocracy and the Irish-speaking peasantry is critiqued. This is contrasted to the incredible dynamism of traditional music under the influence of recording technology and the growth of audiences on both sides of the Atlantic. Chapter 3, ''Thought-Tormented Music': Joyce on the Music of the Irish Revival,' expands an article I published in the James Joyce Quarterly, and explores Joyce's musical life and tastes and the place of music in key places in his fiction: the short stories 'A Mother' and 'The Dead,' and the 'Sirens' chapter of Ulysses. Chapter 4, 'Aesthetic Absorption, Aesthetic Value, Identity and Traditional Music,' explores the terms 'aesthetic', 'experience', and 'absorption', from the perspective of a number of disciplines and articulates the experience of absorption and identity in the field of music. This chapter draws on Ciar&amp;aacute;n Benson's reflections on philosophical pragmatism and psychology which explore the relationship of aesthetic experience and in particular to moments of 'positive absorption' in aesthetic experience, to the development of personal identity. I also reflect on recently translated works on the politics of the aesthetic by Jacques Ranciere, In Chapter 5, 'The Sociology of the Session,' I examine the paradigmatic setting for the performance of contemporary Irish traditional music, drawing on fieldwork, auto-ethnographic reflection, and the work of sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, particularly his analysis of the category of 'honour' in Kabyle society. Chapter 6, 'The Construction of the Musical Other in Northern Ireland,' combines and revises a number of recent publications on politics, culture, and music in Northern Ireland during the peace process. I reflect directly on my experience working with musicians and arts organizations as Traditional Arts Officer of the Arts Council of Northern Ireland from 1998 to 2004, incorporating field work with musicians and cultural activists and research into cultural policy since the 1970s. I use the concept of 'suture' articulated by psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan and developed by political scientists Ernesto Laclau, Chantal Mouffe, and Slavoj Zizek to explain both the function of Ulster Scots culture in Northern Ireland politics.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In addition to academic beneficiaries, there are two important non-academic communities of interest on which this research will have an impact. The first is policy makers and decision makers in the arts and culture sectors in Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland, and the UK more generally. This community of interest includes board members and employees of Arts Councils, staff of the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure in Northern Ireland, culturally active politicians, National Lottery fund distributors, and people involved in community relations and arts education projects. (For more detail on this audience, see the 'pathways to impact' section in the attachments to this proposal.) 'Stones in the Field' deals directly with issues of cultural identity and social cohesion that are very much alive in debates about cultural policy and state support for the arts in Ireland. The essays provide much needed historical context and critical analysis of recent political developments. The arguments I make have a direct relevance to policies and programmes which target the important civic goals of social cohesion and mutual understanding of cultural traditions which have been central to the peace process in Northern Ireland. This is especially the case for the final chapter of the book, which reflects directly on my experience working with musicians and arts organizations as Traditional Arts Officer of the Arts Council of Northern Ireland from 1998 to 2004, and incorporates field work with northern musicians and cultural activists and research into cultural policy since the 1970s. I also will analyze how arts development policies increasingly tied funding to the potential of arts organisations to effectively deliver an array of extra-artistic social outcomes. I explain why in Northern Ireland of the mid-1990s, many were caught off-guard by the comet-like arrival of a previously unarticulated Ulster Scots identity, replete with its own folk traditions. I use the concept of 'suture' articulated by Lacan and developed by Laclau, Mouffe, and Zizek to explain both the potential for Ulster Scots culture to enter political discourse out of a seeming vacuum and its subsequent difficulties, offering an original interpretation of the role of culture in the contemporary trajectory of Northern Ireland politics. I identify Ulster Scots as a suturing element-a cultural body harnessed to fill an inherent political 'lack'-that stabilizes Unionist identity in times of crisis, and articulates the inherent limitations of the suture, whose logic functions like a 'straightjacket on cultural life,' and proposes an alternative, more genuinely open approach to Irish culture. The chapter features a close reading and historical contextualisation of the Ulster-Scots musical revue On Eagle's Wing, which was developed during this period, and will conclude with an assessment of the current state of cultural negotiation in Northern Ireland in the second decade of the twenty-first century. \n\nThe second community of interest that will benefit from this research is the vast international community of practitioners and followers of Irish traditional music. As that practice has become global, stretching beyond even the Irish diaspora, the importance of understanding its historical context has increased along with the difficulty of accessing that context. Performers of traditional music will have, for the first time, a professional guide to the rich historical layers that lay buried in their repertoire and to the evolution of political and social contexts of performance and transmission. With this information and understanding, practicing musicians will be in a better position to disseminate that understanding from concert platforms and other commercial media to the wider public.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>33031</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Consultations with and citation by commissioned research by the Department of Culture, Arts, and Leisure in Northern Ireland</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>9CEF0B21-1390-4C90-8BEA-1EFFB14E1027</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54356047239f76.35534309</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The historical development of popular music in Ireland from the eighteenth to the early twentieth century has for the first time been narrated in monograph form.

The role of traditional music in the literary and cultural revival in Irish public life in the politically crucial period 1892-1916 has been for the first time thoroughly researched and interpreted.

Using a large database of interviews with musicians, and reflection on personal experience as a performer and employee in the public arts sector, the evolution of traditional music in during the Troubles and the Peace Process in Northern Ireland has been outlined. The complex role of traditional music as both vehicle for social cohesion and reconciliation and as material for the formation of antagonistic cultural identities and political constituencies has been researched and analyzed in detail.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>History: the narrative of the development of Irish popular music from the eighteenth century into what is today called traditional music is still incompletely researched in many periods, with a number of important manuscript sources from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries yet to be fully studied, and the important period from the 1920s leading into the international folk revival of the 1960s has yet to be properly researched and narrated. 

The cultural and political situation in Northern Ireland continues to evolve in the context of economic stagnation and austerity in both jurisdictions in Ireland, movements for devolution elsewhere in the United Kingdom, and the rise of a new generation of musicians. Fieldwork conducted by myself and others in the 1990s and 2000s needs to be updated and contextualized in light of contemporary developments.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>1B5C8168-5FB1-42BE-B47D-156FBE6A0324</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5447bf2369b1b4.33547863</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Consultation and citation in cultural policy document commisioned by Department of Culture Arts and Leisure, Northern Ireland</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>156227AE-421F-403A-B051-404434596572</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Contributed to greater awareness of scope and impact of cultural activity on community relations in Northern Ireland.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54355f0b9f1e54.85595495</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.dcalni.gov.uk/ulster-scots_music_traditions_-_final_report_-_2_4_14.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0C7F09D7-3558-4547-99DA-6E52B43ECC29</gtr:id><gtr:title>Music and Identity in Ireland and Beyond</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d13e328e8df614e0e9746e547814024d"><gtr:id>d13e328e8df614e0e9746e547814024d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dowling M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781472409669</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>54355ab14eade4.36310154</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BD62B08A-1D94-4E03-86B0-209ABE654DD1</gtr:id><gtr:title>Reflecting on Tradition: Four Ulster Musical Lives, Ulster Folklife, volume 53</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d13e328e8df614e0e9746e547814024d"><gtr:id>d13e328e8df614e0e9746e547814024d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dowling M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5435596d47a228.63432838</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6BB9427B-31E1-4CF6-B4AE-1902D8B7CA0C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Traditional Music and Irish Society: Historical Perspectives</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/3158db1f2465290a8f814da708021404"><gtr:id>3158db1f2465290a8f814da708021404</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dowling Martin</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781409435105</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>543546bd06a338.37458511</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>50C35095-9627-43AE-A2C1-50360C43F895</gtr:id><gtr:title>Are the Irish Different?</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d13e328e8df614e0e9746e547814024d"><gtr:id>d13e328e8df614e0e9746e547814024d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dowling M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780719095825</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>543559ee9a3cb0.79473996</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C329F4AC-D6C2-41DB-A679-8A2901C97AEA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Creating a Circus of Words, Music, and Sound: From Roaratorio to Owenvarragh</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Black Mountain College Studies Journal</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d13e328e8df614e0e9746e547814024d"><gtr:id>d13e328e8df614e0e9746e547814024d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dowling M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>54355bd5d85486.75146837</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I024526/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>0AEFDABE-67A4-48B1-9DB4-99393BDE6065</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Music</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3BFAE48F-77C7-453F-8049-A1455B8B0E96</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Music &amp; Society</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
