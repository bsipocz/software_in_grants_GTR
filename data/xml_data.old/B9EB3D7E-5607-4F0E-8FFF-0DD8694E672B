Asylum and migration issues are high on political and policy agendas and there is a growing interest in ensuring that policy approaches are evidence-based. At the same time there is increasing interest among migrant organisations and communities in engaging with research processes in ways that do not simply replicate existing assumptions about 'the migrant experience' but enable them to shape research agendas and engage with political and policy processes in a meaningful way. The Seminar Series was able to tap into this interest in a highly original and innovative way by bringing together academic and non-academic users of research with migrants, refugees and asylum seekers. We drew upon our existing relations with the Home Office, Welsh Assembly Government and voluntary sector organisations, as well as our partnerships with the Institute for Public Policy Research and Migrant Rights Network to secure the participation of research users. 

Although it is difficult to assess the impact of this approach for both academic and non-academic users of research, it is our experience that bringing together different groups in the (relatively) neutral setting of a research seminar is beneficial to all. It provides non-academic users of research with an opportunity to 'step back' from the day-to-day demands of service delivery, advocacy and policy formulation, and academic researchers will an opportunity to gain insights into the realities of life and practice 'on the ground' for practitioners, policy makers and migrants themselves. A number of activities have arisen directly as a result of the Research Seminar Series. These include:

- A Film Seminar Series held by CMPR during 2010 during which three films were screened at the Taliesin Arts Centre followed by a lively public discussion of the issues raised
- A series of events and seminars held as part of Refugee Week 2010
- A new MA in Global Migration was developed at Swansea University. The scheme started in October 2011 and included a module on 'Understanding the Migrant Experience' which drew directly on the discussion that took place during the Seminar Series. Some of the Seminar speakers were invited to contribute to this module.
- The PI subsequently became an external examiner for UEL's MA in Refugee Studies and there is now teaching collaboration between the two research institutes, particularly in relation to methodological issues associated with researching 'the migrant experience'
- A postgraduate research conference entitled 'Understanding the Migrant Experience' was held at Swansea University in 2012 to further explore the issues associated with undertaking research with migrants and to showcase the work of early career researchers
- The PI subsequently worked closely with the Wales Strategic Migration Partnership to produce a series of briefing papers on key issues associated with migration to Wales for dissemination to policy makers, practitioners and the general public</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2009</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>EEC37080-981F-4FBF-99F1-41BAB7C3D370</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>546df7c51c2ea1.14341151</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-451-26-0596</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">RES-451-26-0596</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>B57EEFB7-602E-4F5D-92E4-A0C265266249</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Demography &amp; human geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
