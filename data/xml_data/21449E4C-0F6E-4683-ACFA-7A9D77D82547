Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>NE/H023704/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>General Summary: Our work brings together data on developmental rate of fish larvae, population genetics, ocean circulation and the environment (specifically temperature) to generate predictions of recruitment that can be tested. This provides us with a powerful tool for tackling the uncertainty that characterizes the dynamics of wild populations in a rapidly changing world. Many fish populations, as all species living in nature, are exposed to a wide variety of changes in the environment that determine their abundance and distribution. Some changes are natural and include such things as alterations in food supply or number of mates, while others are largely driven by man-made activities, of which climate change and exploitation are two major types. Since fish form a major component of natural ecosystems in providing food for many other animals, and are predators of many groups, and since they also form a major source of human food globally, it is important that we estimate the role of various environmental changes on their dynamics, especially as many fish populations have recently collapsed, or are only in early stages of recovery. Here we examine, using several fish species from a well characterised region of the Antarctic, the potential effect that an increase in temperature might have on the numbers of fish entering the adult population ('recruitment'), and more specifically the rate at which their larvae develop. It is well established that at higher temperatures, larvae that rely on yolk resources for nutrition will exhaust these supplies more quickly at higher temperatures, meaning they may not reach appropriate feeding grounds in time to develop into adults. In such circumstances, fewer young will recruit to the next generation of individuals, and since dispersal among sites will be reduced, populations would be expected to lose connectivity, which has follow-on effects on population and ecosystem resilience. We will examine how likely such effects are by observing fish larvae of several species differing slightly in their life history larval characteristics, and compare their rates of development in relation to fluctuations in temperature. We test whether higher temperatures do indeed lead to faster development by two means: (1) with live larvae acclimated to different temperatures regimes within a season, and (2) with archived larval specimens sampled from the wild across multiple years in which developmental temperature regimes varied. We then take this information and add it to Individual Based Models incorporating ocean circulation and biological characteristics of each species, thus creating species-specific biophysical models. This allows us to test whether any changes in rate of development will influence the likelihood of larvae reaching appropriate feeding grounds and recruiting to the adult population. Model predictions of dispersal for the present-day will be validated by comparison with inferred dispersal from genetic analyses, and an assessment of dispersal variability due to interannual oceanographic variability will allow the effects of increased temperature to be placed in context. It will then be possible to make predictions about the likely effects of the predicted increases in temperature in the area on fish recruitment as a component of climate change. Such information is important since climate records from the Antarctic show that the waters of the Antarctic are warming more rapidly than the global ocean as a whole. Not only is this significant for much of the biodiversity that is unique to the Antarctic, but the Southern Ocean is known to influence climates globally. Ultimately, our integration of environmentally relevant data taken from nature, with genetically validated 'biophysical' models will enable a more realistic projection of the impact of ocean warming on marine species and ecosystems.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>253856</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Royal Society Partnership Grant between Bangor University and local Secondary School on Angelesey</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4CD48936-228A-44CD-B513-190C6BCB22A6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The overall aim of the Royal Society Partnership Grant was to increase the awareness of global warming to students in a local secondary school on Anglesey, North Wales (Ysgol Uwchradd Bodedern; YUB), by utilising an existing NERC-funded project exploring fish development in Antarctic waters. Specifically, students were introduced to basic principles of climate change, with emphasis on the specific vulnerability of Antarctic marine systems, followed by an in-depth consideration of alternative scientific methods for exploring the impact of elevated temperatures. Students were encouraged to discuss the evidence-base for climate change, with reference to the scientific method. The particular focus was the impact that elevated temperatures can have on the developmental rate of fish larvae, and consequences on dispersal and distribution of fish populations. Key methodologies that were employed included the use of microscopy to examine a range of Antarctic fish larvae, use of DNA-based genetic approaches to examine the genetic relationships among populations in relation to larval dispersal and recruitment, and the use of fish ear-bones, the otoliths, as chronometers of fish age. Emphasis was placed on the integration of the above complementary approaches, such that larval development and relationships among populations could be predicted across different elevated temperature scenarios. 

The project entailed several discrete stages: 1.School-based where the students were introduced to the project by both the school and science partners, as well as ongoing guidance on microscopy and DNA profiling techniques. See Presentation X delivered by University Partners, Carvalho &amp;amp; De Bruyn. 2. University-based, entailing a full day (and detailed in the attached brochure: Handbook Bodedern School Visit) where students were introduced in more detail to the wider research context of the research, as well as examining a range of fish larvae and otolith removal and ageing exercises. See assorted photographs - YUB-Bangor. Working in small groups, students were provided with hands-on experience in the full DNA profiling procedures including extraction of DNA, assessing DNA quality through electrophoresis gels, the process of PCR, and subsequent DNA genotyping using an automated ABI sequencer. Students also gave group presentations on various aspects of the Partnership Grant, including the nature and significance of climate change, and introduction to animals and adaptations to Antarctic life, how to prepare for field work in the Antarctic, and how to tackle some of the causes of climate change. They concluded with a set of exercises and specific questions based on activities undertaken during the day. The Partnership representative from the Royal Society, Marie Claude Dupois, joined us for the day. 3. School -based, where the techniques and knowledge acquired from the University was used to design a bridging exercise for local primary pupils. In addition, the wider community of pupils at school were introduced to the project at morning assembly. 4. Broadcasting from the Antarctic: an opportunity was provided to students by the visit of a postdoctoral researcher funded by the NERC (Dr Niklas Tysklind), to South Georgia to undertake field work and laboratory experiments on larval development. In addition to a telephone call between the students and researcher, students could follow the progress of the research through the project website and blog (http://isow.bangor.ac.uk/; http://niktysklind.wordpress.com/, with an opportunity for question-answer exchanges with the students. 5. The bridging exercise between YUB students and a local primary school, with presentations, posters and a question and answer session introduced the primary pupils to the activities and context of the project. See assorted photographs - YUB-Bangor.

In addition to the planned activities, an opportunity arose for the students to engage in the annual Bangor Science Festival, by contributing to the Hidden World exhibition (http://www.bangor.ac.uk/bangorsciencefestival2014/; see Assorted Photographs YUB-Bangor). During the event, over 500 members of the public visited the exhibition of the Partnership Project, providing an opportunity for pupils to demonstrate microscopic examination of fish larvae and otoliths, the use of DNA techniques to assess dispersal, interactive software introducing members of the public to Antarctic life (with software and displays provided by the British Antarctic Survey), and various competitions concerning life and climate change in the Antarctic. Based in small groups, students gave 3 oral presentations to the general public on their activities and the importance and impact of climate change, as well as providing seedlings free of charge as part of an ongoing wider School project, for visitors to plant in their own garden to contribute to atmospheric CO2 removal. The event concluded with awards (stuffed penguins) presented by the students to winners (children) of the competitions held in the morning.

Project evaluation 

We present a summary of the collective responses from students obtained by the School partner (Head of Biology, Ms. Lyndell Williams: see Final Report- Summary of Student Feedback). Although the responses were limited due to the end of the school session, Ms Williams had received constructive and enthusiastic responses from the students throughout the duration of the Partnership Grant. The tone of the responses presented were representative of those throughput. The students had indicated that they would have preferred access to plankton samples at an earlier stage in the project, but logistics constrained their on-site collection. A time-series has now been made available for student observations in the new school session in autumn 2014.

Conclusion

The project addressed all original aims, and in addition, used the opportunity of the Bangor Science Festival to widen the experience of students in presenting their work, and in broadening the impact to include members of the public. 
Benefits to the students: In addition to the acquisition of experience in applying the scientific method and use of evidence to test hypotheses concerning climate change, students gained through stimulating their interest in science and its communication to non-specialists, as well as developing self-confidence and presentation skills through delivery to scientists, fellow pupils, primary school pupils and the general public. Curiosity and enthusiasm was stimulated, especially from the opportunity for direct exchange with scientists working in the Antarctic. Additional generic skills were enhanced through statistical and data analysis exercises, microscopy and general laboratory procedures.
Benefits to the teacher/school: In addition to the enhancement of resources through direct funds to purchase microscopes, digital camera and laptop for dedicated and ongoing use, new exchanges with the University and participation in the Bangor Science Festival provided opportunities to enhance scientific and transferable skills. The School included details of the Partnership grant in a recent competition sponsored by a regional newspaper (Daily Post: See Award to YUB- including details of the original Press Release announcing the Partnership Grant) ), to identify the Best Secondary School in North Wales. YUB won first prize, and acknowledged the activities, training and wider impact of the Royal Society Partnership grant, in contributing to their success. 
Scientist: Wider participation in the Public Understanding of Science and engagement with the Bangor Science Festival, as well as the opportunity to tailor resources and activities to enhance the impact of scientific endeavours. Exchanges between the School and University provided a valuable stimulus to widen the participation of schools and regional community of students to participate in additional activities such as open days and student exchange visits. 
Long-term benefits and sustaining the Partnership: The partnership grant contributed both directly to student training as global warming is part of the science curriculum, and indirectly by stimulating awareness and interest in a major societal challenge. Moreover, it placed other school activities such as the programme to plant seedlings to enhance CO2 capture, as one participatory way of individuals tackling climate change. Moreover, students were encouraged to enact and communicate additional salient practices, such as reducing energy consumption and waste production. A time-series of plankton samples obtained from South Georgia waters have been returned to the University partner, and will be forwarded for ongoing identification by YUB students in the new session. The material was collected by Dr Tysklind, and is intended to provide students with new additional information on the structure and diversity of Antarctic plankton communities over time. The school additionally intends to participate in future activities associated with the Bangor Science Festival. Additional opportunities to foster exchanges between YUB and the University will be explored through voluntary student visits, delivery of presentations by University scientists at the School, and consideration of additional local and national funding schemes to promote interactions.

Although several different approaches to evaluating connectivity have been used, they are rarely integrated quantitatively to elucidate the drivers of population genetic structuring. Here, we used a 'seascape genetics' approach, combining complementary approaches of numerical modelling and microsatellite analyses, to understand the dominant influences on the population genetic structure of Champsocephalus gunnari and Notothenia rossii. The close accord between the model projections and empirical genetic structure demonstrates that connectivity during the planktonic early life stages is the dominant influence on patterns and extent of genetic structuring in both species. The shorter planktonic phase of C. gunnari restricts direct transport of larvae between distant populations, leading to stronger regional differentiation; genetic structuring is dictated by the underlying oceanographic flows, which influence the direction and magnitude of stepping-stone transport routes. Inter-annual variability in oceanographic flows strongly impacted the projected genetic structure, suggesting that shifts in circulation patterns due to climate change are likely to impact future genetic connectivity and opportunities for local adaptation, resilience and recovery from perturbations. Further development of realistic climate models is required to fully assess such potential impacts.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Management of the fishery as well as impacts of climate change on population structure and exploitation.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>BAE435CD-BB03-44F7-A7DB-37E5EF67AF24</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54576cfe19f948.26555570</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>998B9480-5334-4161-AB87-5A7E7FC90912</gtr:id><gtr:title>Physical and behavioural influences on larval fish retention: contrasting patterns in two Antarctic fishes</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Marine Ecology Progress Series</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ea69fb061899abcc30605490b7017212"><gtr:id>ea69fb061899abcc30605490b7017212</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Young E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d08e08e6ef162d</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>82F2EAD4-1ADD-417A-B7DA-306624F30D20</gtr:id><gtr:title>Stepping stones to isolation: impacts of a changing climate on the connectivity of fragmented fish populations</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Evolutionary Applications</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ea69fb061899abcc30605490b7017212"><gtr:id>ea69fb061899abcc30605490b7017212</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Young E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a901abd767e73.38615127</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>32184CE5-8014-4238-AD1B-6BA88F9C9080</gtr:id><gtr:title>Oceanography and life history predict contrasting genetic population structure in two Antarctic fish species.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Evolutionary applications</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/eef670664acbcb60f9aab27fdce0b1f3"><gtr:id>eef670664acbcb60f9aab27fdce0b1f3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Young EF</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1752-4571</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5675e586b2ca0</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/H023704/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Climate &amp; Climate Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C23BE70F-1EF6-4CC7-88B0-841CB18DD875</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Genetics &amp; development</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E05CFC1B-8264-49AB-8A54-E3A86F404707</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Marine environments</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>13975896-2E87-4DAA-99BC-E8D86B00B146</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Plant &amp; crop science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Climate &amp; Climate Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6CA01F47-BDE6-46F1-8679-A31D5317A885</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environmental Physiology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>723BA0F8-3ECD-4E2A-A39E-44936EAC1517</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ocean Circulation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A4209D5A-2E41-4290-9D1A-3172C1F48962</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Population Genetics/Evolution</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
