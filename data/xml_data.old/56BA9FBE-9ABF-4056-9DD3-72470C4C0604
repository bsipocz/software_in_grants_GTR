Charities, voluntary groups, community associations, and informal networks of like-minded individuals, are praised for being more responsive and in-touch than political parties and governmental organisations and able to articulate the needs of local communities, particularly those who lack influence and cannot speak for themselves. CSOs are driven by values to produce social change within their community. Therefore, they can be innovative in designing and delivering services that people actually need and, through active participation, CSOs can foster 'social capital': developing the networks, norms and trust, necessary for cooperation and social engagement. This not only increases community cohesion but harnesses local community resources, grassroots energy, enthusiasm and ideas to build a vibrant civil society. Together, these features mean that CSOs have the potential to facilitate civic democratic renewal and support citizens' services that are actively run by and for local communities, rather than being dictated to by central government or private enterprises driven by profit and market forces.
Over the past three decades successive governments have tried to capitalise on the responsive and democratic elements of CSOs to provide services previously delivered by the state. For instance, a written aim of the current government is to &amp;quot;support the creation and expansion of mutuals, co-operatives, charities and social enterprises, and enable these groups to have much greater involvement in the running of public services&amp;quot; (Cabinet Office, 2014). Consequently, in increasing numbers, schools, libraries, health and social care services, and many previously delivered public services are being run by CSOs or private organisations. To date, over 100 public services have been &amp;quot;spun out&amp;quot; in &amp;quot;Public service mutuals&amp;quot; and the government's stated aim is for 1 in 5 public sector workers to run their own mutuals (Mutuals Taskforce Report, 2015). 
As CSOs are called upon to deliver public services, concerns have been raised over the impact this might have on the less measureable, democratic functions of a healthy civil society. As service providers, competing with private businesses, they are subject to regulation by both state and market forces, limiting members abilities to promote and respond to community and membership needs. The influential Baring's Foundation Report has recently argued CSOs are losing their democratic heritage (2015), highlighting the 2014 Lobbying Act which places new restrictions on CSOs campaigning and commissioning that does not support independence and diversity of the sector. CSO, they argue, have in effect become victims of a 'gagging clause' and can now be viewed as the contractual arm of the state, providing services rather than advocacy. There are also growing concerns this is accentuating the undemocratic of CSOs, centralising power and potentially corrupting them and their original independence and intentions.
This seminar series explores these issues and asks: what are the features that promote and undermine the role CSOs play within democratic civic renewal? With speakers from leading CSOs such as Greenpeace, UNESCO and Co-operatives UK, inter-disciplinary academics including from geography, business, economics, sociology, peace studies, philosophy and political theory and policymakers the seminar series investigates these issues from multiple perspectives. It will also build upon existing examples from the experiments that are occurring throughout the UK and Europe where new forms of CSOs are currently being developed.
The six seminars will examine the meaning, conditions, possibilities and promises of democracy within civil society. By bringing together an inter-disciplinary network of academics, policymakers and practitioners it will develop a long-term shared interest in civil society and democracy.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The influential Baring's Foundation Report chaired by Sir Roger Singleton CBE has recently argued that the independence of civil society organisations (CSOs) is under threat. The report argued that independence lies at the heart of civil society but suggest that &amp;quot;unless we act now, the future of an independent voluntary sector [and by implication wider civil society] is at serious risk&amp;quot; (2015, p. 3). The report suggests that whilst CSOs offer the hope of greater participation and engagement they are becoming merely a shadow state that lacks transparency and voice.
This seminar series takes up this topic and broadens it to look not only at the conditions of democracy within civil society (the focus of the Barings Report) but also the meaning, practices and possibilities of democracy within civil society. The seminar series will contribute to this debate by bringing together academics from a diverse fields including geography, business, economics, sociology, peace studies, philosophy and political theory, practitioners, policymakers and activists all interested in the democracy within civil society. By engaging this diverse audience that often sit in silos the series will provide an opportunity to deepen and extend the debate.
Having multi-disciplined academics and internationally recognised speakers included in the proposal including Kumi Naidoo, International Executive Director of Greenpeace and former Secretary General of Civicuc, Janet Dalziell Director of Global Development Greenpeace, Rajesh Tandon co-director of UNESCO Chair on Community-based Research and Social Responsibility and Ed Mayo, Secretary General of Co-operatives UK, the series will provide opportunities to explore up-to-date theory and practice on democracy in civil society. The facilitated discussions will enable a range of practitioner experiences to be explored.
The seminar series will develop the links between policymakers, think tanks, funding commissioners, 2nd and particularly 3rd tier Third Sector organisations (such as NCVO) and government ministers with an interest in civil society and democracy. Government minister for Civil Society, members of the opposition and relevant policymakers, think-tanks and research groups including Compass, Co-ops Network, Institute of Volunteering Research, and consultancy and advocacy group MUTUO will be invited. 
The seminar series will be located in Nottingham, Leicester, Leeds and London. Each seminar will attract approximately 20 local CSOs, invited through local infrastructure organisations (such as Council for Voluntary Services), grassroots community groups and through the host academics networks. Reports will be included in local and regional newsletters. This will give each seminar a distinct local feel and provide the opportunity to extend the connection between the university and their local community, providing opportunities for research, consultancy and impact. 
The practitioners, policymakers and commissions benefit through the discussions of the latest research and debates around democracy within civil society. It will also provide the opportunity to meet fellow practitioners and forge relationships with researchers. Furthermore the policy and practice implications of the sessions will be distilled with the key implications for practice will be written in short, practical briefing documents.
Contact has been made with Third Sector, Charity Times, and The Guardian Voluntary Sector Network to build relations with journalists. The Press department of Nottingham Trent University will develop press releases based on research raised by the seminars. 
The seminar series will also engage the industry body the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) to develop policy document for the HR implications for democratic accountability within CSOs. This will enable CSOs interested in more democratic forms of organising to have a long-term resource to develop their practice.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-11-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-11-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>21655</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seminar 1 - The meaning of democracy</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4326214F-91F6-4D68-A2B2-8F5241896015</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Approximately 55 people attended the seminar held at Cass Business School.
