Involvement in peer bullying has been found to be associated with a range of adverse outcomes in childhood including academic problems, physical and mental health problems, and suicidal ideations and attempts. An understanding of which factors increase the risk of children becoming involved in bullying behaviour at school is necessary in order to develop prevention or intervention programs that go beyond the school context. Moreover, it is still unclear whether bullying throws a long shadow over affected children?s lives into adulthood.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project will use a number of prospective data sets (ALSPAC, Understanding Society (USoc), Great Smokey Mountain Study (GSMS)) to investigate:&lt;/p>

&lt;ol>
 

 &lt;li>the relationship between pregnancy (family adversity, maternal anxiety and depression), preschool family factors (problematic partner relationships, parenting) and individual characteristics (behavioural dysregulation, ethnicity) on involvement in peer bullying at school age&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>the impact of bullying in childhood on late adolescence and early adult psychiatric morbidity, suicide ideation and attempts, susceptibility to health problems and wealth creation.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ol></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Understanding the precursors of peer victimisation and their effects on social relationships, work life and income generation, involvement in crime and health in early adulthood is important to improve the nations wealth, health and culture.

The beneficiaries from this research are:

1. Academia (e.g. psychologists, psychiatrists, social scientists, economists, criminologists, public health professionals, genetic epidemiologists) nationally and internationally. The impact will be on theory development and development of an interdisciplinary research programme (understanding mechanisms, prevention research) 
2. Public Sector. This includes the sectors involved in health delivery in pregnancy and postnatal (i.e. NHS, GPs), preschool services (e.g. sure start, nursery education, parent education), schools (teachers) and services for promoting skills for young people in their transition to employment (e.g. Departments of Work and Pensions; Education)
3. Third Sector. The findings will have high relevance for the Anti-Bullying Alliance (e.g. NSPCC, Childline, Beatbullying, Kidscape, National Bullying Helpline, Childrens Society etc.).
4. General Public. Bullying is high on the list of parent and school children's concern. It would highlight potential pathways to help. 
5. Business/Industry. There are no direct commercial implications. However, should victimised children show poorer adaptation to employment, dealing with these past experiences could increase productivity and development of employee potential. Resulting intervention tools that could be IT based (serious games) would require industrial developers. 

How might they benefit from this research?

1. The research makes a contribution to understanding health and wellbeing of children and adults. It has direct implications for educating health professionals. Awareness about the long term sequelae of bullying helps to integrate this into practice: e.g. the GP asking about bullying in children and young people as precursor of presenting symptoms. The development of potential interventions that are NHS linked (e.g. NIHR). 
2. If employment, income generation or dependence on social benefits is related to peer victimisation in childhood, then strengthening individuals to resist victimisation and promote positive peer relationships (prevention, intervention) may be a highly cost effective investment for social welfare and public services.
3. Third sector. The results on adult outcome would strengthen their fund raising abilities. Findings will inform their information campaigns, training and development of prevention and intervention strategies. The findings may have implications for third sector funders of research into pregnancy (e.g. Tommy's), health (Wellcome Trust), child development and education (e.g. Nuffield Foundation, Jacobs Foundation). 

Pathways to Impact

1. The findings are new and would allow for high impact publications in academic journals.
2. The findings will be disseminated at an international and national conference for professionals. It is likely to generate further interest for presentation at special interest group conferences.
3. The applications includes a special dissemination workshop that will present the main findings targeted at multiple stakeholders: Third sector delegates (charities involved with children and bullying), Public sector (invitees from Education and Work and Pension Department), Teacher delegates (via teacher unions, organisations), health service delgates, public figures involved in bullying prevention (e.g. Esther Rantzen, Fiona Bruce); academics.
4. Communication activities with the media will be facilitated and coordinated by the Press Office at the University of Warwick. Press releases are likely to be generated by release of the findings in academic journals, conferences and the final dissemination event. Furthermore, a podcast and summary fact sheet will be produced by the research team.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-11-25</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-11-26</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>156351</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The Longterm Consequences of Bullying Involvement</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F2F15AFF-B3D2-403A-8027-C0F9D94F411F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Gave an invite lecture to about 200 participants.

All our publications received extensive media coverage in newspapers (e.g. The Guardian, Reuters, and Daily Mail), online journals (e.g. BBC News Webpage), international news networks (e.g. ABC, Reuter) and on radio and TV (e.g. BBC1 Breakfast, News24, BBC radio 5 live). Moreover, Professor Wolke recorded an interview about the effect of bullying into adulthood for a new series of BBC 1 called &amp;quot;the Gift&amp;quot; (a reality TV programme) which was aired 17.2.2015 in prime time (9 pm). Overall our research has been reported as far afield as Chile and Indonesia as well as extensively in Europe and the US. To increase international awareness to our research, we have also attended two conferences: Pediatric Academic Societies Annual Meeting, 2014 (PAS) and Society for Research in Child Development, 2013 (SRCD). Our presentation at the PAS conference was selected for press release and we had several media interviews after the presentation. 

In the UK, while amendments to the Children and Families' Bill were going through the parliament, the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Bullying invited Professor Wolke to give a talk at their meeting about the consequences of bullying and potential policy implications. Our research contributed greatly to the debate regarding the potential amendments to the Bill.

At the end of our project, we disseminated our policy relevant findings through a round table discussion at the House of Parliament. We were able to reach policy makers, charity representatives and academics; and overall, 43 people attended. During the event, Professor Wolke presented our major findings which followed by a panel discussion moderated by Baroness Brinton. The panel consisted of Carrie Herbert (the chair of Red Balloon charity), Holly Smale (Internationally best-selling author of the anti-bullying series &amp;quot;Geek Girl&amp;quot;) and Professor Wolke. Our event received very positive feedback from the attendees and we established good relationships with charities (such as Red Balloon and Kidscape) and policy makers. 

We believe that our research reached millions of people highlighting the long shadow bullying thrown over the lives of children by bullying. We have received thousands of emails and tweets from people all around the world sharing their stories and feelings. Our research has even been tweeted by three White House members. Moreover, we have helped the Child and Family Public Engagement Board (CAFPEB) of the Royal College of Psychiatrists to create a fact sheet on bullying. We have also been asked to speak in 2015 at the Times Cheltenham Science Festival in the Main Programme on Bullying and its effects to reach a wide audience of lay people. We are currently working with charities such as Red Balloon and Kidscape in developing grant applications to identify protective factors that help children in the face of bullying. This understanding will assist parents, teachers, primary care practitioners and policy makers to provide adequate support for children who are potential targets or are being bullied to develop their potential and build on their strengths to deal with future challenges. This will help us to develop and evaluate new innovative intervention approaches.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>C390044E-E83F-478E-B9CA-87FDEF3E4D03</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5519cb36616406.98584362</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Bullying refers to repeated and prolonged aggressive behaviours that are intentionally targeted towards one or more weaker individuals. Involvement in peer bullying has been associated with a range of adverse outcomes in childhood including physical and mental health problems. Little was still known about long term effects into adulthood. Furthermore, a range of correlates of bullying involvement have been reported but few have investigated precursors. Hence, delineating the pathways to bullying and identifying negative consequences of bullying is paramount. 

The ESRC grant enabled us to investigate and show that children who were exposed to negative parenting including abuse, neglect, maladaptive and overprotective parenting were more likely to be bullied at school. Furthermore, children born to mothers with prenatal stress, or exposed to domestic violence were at increased risk for being bullied at school. Good communication of parents with the child, warm relationship, parental involvement and support, and parental supervision were identified as protective factors against peer victimisation. Those who were bullied at school were at increased risk for self-harm and psychotic experiences in adolescence. They were also more likely to have nightmares, night terrors, or sleepwalk. Moreover, victims of childhood bullying, including those that bullied others (bully-victims), were at increased risk of poor health, wealth, and social-relationship outcomes in adulthood even after controlling for family hardship and childhood psychiatric disorders. On the other hand, pure bullies were not at increased risk of poor outcomes in adulthood. Indeed, bullies were found to show the lowest levels of chronic inflammation, a marker of tear and wear after chronic stress exposure. Bullying between siblings also was found to have adverse consequences for children. Those who were bullied by a sibling several times a week were twice as likely to develop depression, self-harm and anxiety by early adulthood. 

Our publications generated extensive global media coverage including appearances by Professor Wolke on BBC1 Breakfast, News24 and BBC radio 5 live. The All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Bullying invited Professor Wolke to give a talk on our research and their implications. By establishing good relationships with the APPG members and with the assistance of Chris White, MP (also an APPG member); we have disseminated our findings through a round table discussion at the House of Parliament. We have generated an interest to our event from policy makers, charities and academics and overall 43 people attended the event. During the event, Professor Wolke presented our major findings which followed by a panel discussion moderated by Baroness Brinton. The panel consisted of Carrie Herbert (the chair of Red Balloon charity), Holly Smale (Internationally best-selling author of the anti-bullying series &amp;quot;Geek Girl&amp;quot;) and Professor Wolke. We have also produced an evidence briefing (http://www.esrc.ac.uk/_images/The%20long-term%20cost%20of%20bullying_tcm8-30744.pdf) and podcast describing precursors and consequences of bullying and policy implications.

During the funding period, our findings and communication with charities indicated a group of children who seem to beat the odds despite being bullied. To develop effective intervention it will be important to identify protective factors that help children in the face of bullying.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings shed light into the precursors and consequences of bullying. The findings suggest the importance of intervention programs against bullying extending their focus beyond schools to include families. Moreover, the programs may start before children enter school especially if the parents are having a stressful pregnancy. Pregnancy and postnatal services (i.e. NHS, GPs), preschool services (e.g. sure start, nursery education, parent education), schools (teachers) and services for promoting skills for young people in their transition to employment (e.g. Departments of Work and Pensions; Education) can benefit from our findings for identifying children at risk for being bullied and work toward coordinating their responses. For example, a primary care practitioner can identify the potential signs of bullying and this early detection and intervention has the potential to improve health during childhood as well as preventing the long-term damaging effects of childhood bullying. Additionally, our findings can help in shaping policy regarding bullying laws in the schools.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>20B5CC82-3F16-480F-89C7-2A4FAD443D91</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54612d9fef3349.02431093</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/psych/research/lifespan/dw</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>CFD8E34E-286C-4AF7-96D6-0FAF50BEAA8A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Ethnicity and bullying involvement in a national UK youth sample.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of adolescence</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/0066d6008eab01876bc04becfabd341f"><gtr:id>0066d6008eab01876bc04becfabd341f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Tippett N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0140-1971</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cfe2fe225be712</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9063A8F8-339C-4A72-9162-2534D393BD22</gtr:id><gtr:title>Parenting behavior and the risk of becoming a victim and a bully/victim: a meta-analysis study.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Child abuse &amp; neglect</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8b46ae12c0f30621391ef7ab5d9defbb"><gtr:id>8b46ae12c0f30621391ef7ab5d9defbb</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lereya ST</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0145-2134</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cfe9fe93691710</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>ED73773D-B95B-4A2D-A487-3DA610066961</gtr:id><gtr:title>Impact of bullying in childhood on adult health, wealth, crime, and social outcomes.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Psychological science</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5772171aabad30da1e722c4e20415712"><gtr:id>5772171aabad30da1e722c4e20415712</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wolke D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0956-7976</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d079079e36b869</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A9106A67-5FBA-4C04-9397-CC7E25F66C2D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Adult Functional Outcomes of Common Childhood Psychiatric Problems: A Prospective, Longitudinal Study.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>JAMA psychiatry</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/07d60657f371f893badc15db0168f655"><gtr:id>07d60657f371f893badc15db0168f655</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Copeland WE</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2168-622X</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58aef74011e916.26087111</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>CD25198A-BF23-4A6D-884C-FCE78B93910B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Does childhood bullying predict eating disorder symptoms?
