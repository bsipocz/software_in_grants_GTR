Markovian random walks (with short memory) in d-dimensional space have been studied since the early years of the twentieth century as simple models of various phenomena (like diffusion of particles suspended in fluids in thermal equilibrium). By now all aspects of these random processes are fully understood. However, true physical (and other natural) phenomena are much more complicated than these na&amp;iuml;ve models and the methods of classical probability simply do not suffice for their study. In particular, due to interactions of the observed moving particle with its environment long-time correlations build up and therefore the na&amp;iuml;ve Markovian approximations become unsuitable. Since the early 1980s very intense research has been concentrated on understanding more realistic mathematical models of diffusion-like phenomena. Among the most investigated classes of models are the following: 

-- Random walks and diffusions in random environment, where the local rules of the random walker are spatially inhomogeneous and randomly sampled themselves.

-- Random walks with self-interactions, where the random walker's local rules are influenced by its own past trajectory via some local functional of its own occupation time measure.

-- Diffusion under deterministic (typically Hamiltonian) dynamics, where the randomness comes only with the initial conditions of the system, e.g. due to thermal equilibrium.

Our research ambition is to understand the long-time asymptotic scaling behaviour of these processes. We will study the long-time asymptotics (so-called scaling limits) of these processes, proving normal or anomalous diffusion in relevant models. 

Stochastic representations for quantum spin systems:
More than eighty years since its formulation the quantum Heisenberg model of interacting spins is still a fundamental model of quantum statistical physics. It is sufficiently rich to encode complex physical phenomena and pose deep mathematical challges. The main problem is the existence of so-called off-diagonal long range order - a kind of magnetic ordering - in particular instances. The relevance of the problem is emphasized by noting that off-diagonal long range order is equivalent to Bose-Einstein condensation, thus being of paramount importance in understanding of superfluidity. In a ground breaking work published in 1978 Dyson, Lieb and Simon (DLS) proved the occurrence of off-diagonal long-range order at low positive temperatures in 3 dimensions, for models with antiferromagnetic interactions. Since then a similar result for ferromagnetic couplings escapes all attempts of rigorous mathematical proof. The main problem here is establishing a particular correlation inequality called infrared bound. The method of DLS substantially relies on a particular feature of the antiferromagnetic models, called reflection positivity, which simply doesn't hold in ferromagnetic cases. Nevertheless, the infrared bound is expected to hold. A major challenge for the specialists working in this field is to find some way around the reflection positivity argument and arrive at the truly relevant correlation inequalities (infrared bounds) by other means.

Stochastic representations of the quantum spin systems arise via a beautiful link with probability, the Feynman-Kac formula, and recently became rather popular, since they lead to probabilistic reformulations of the relevant quantum statistical physics problems, typically in terms of interacting stochastic particle systems or stochastic geometric objects, like random loops on graphs.

My main ambition in this context is to apply a well suited probabilistic reformulation of the spin-1/2 isotropic quantum Heisenberg model with ferromagnetic couplings, reformulate the infrared bound as a probabilistic correlation inequality for a particular stochastic interacting particle system (the so-called symmetric simple exclusion model) and prove it this way.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Impact within our scientific community: 
The problems proposed for investigation are in the main stream of current research in probability theory and its applications. There are regular, very prestigious research programmes and conferences dedicated to these and closely related subjects. Recent examples include The Mittag Leffler Institute Stockholm (Spring 2009), The Fields Institute Toronto (Spring 2011), MSRI Berkeley (Spring 2012), the Mathematics Institute of Warwick University (Spring, 2014), the Isaac Newton Institute Cambridge (Spring 2015), where I had been invited. In Spring 2017 I will participate in a similar program at Institut Henri Poincar&amp;eacute;, Paris. I expect similar invitations for the future years, too. The PDRA will also take part and present his research in contributed sessions at similar events. This is clear evidence that any progress made will have a significant impact on both national and international top research. We expect to obtain mathematical results of high scientific value and appreciated by the mathematical community and these will have influence within the mathematics community working on various aspects of probability theory and stochastic processes, with particular emphasis on walks and diffusions in inhomogeneous and random environment. Our results will also have impact on theoretical and mathematical physicists working in statistical and condensed matter physics, on biologists of mathematical orientation working on population dynamics and on network scientists.

Dissemination of our results will be achieved primarily via the traditional venues of mathematical sciences: publications in top rank journals, talks and presentations at prestigious international conferences, active participation in relevant workshops, survey papers and colloquia for wider audiences. As demonstrated by my track record, I publish my research results in leading probability, and mathematical physics journals. All my papers are freely accessible at the acadeic preprint repository arXiv. These are the main channels of dissemination in our profession.

I also plan to give further postgraduate courses at summer schools - as I have done regularly in the past. These will attract prospective young researchers to these topics. 

I am involved in organisation of a number of conferences and workshops on these themes in the coming years. During the first half of this fellowship I will organise three international conferences (Oberwolfach DE, 2016 Nov; Luminy-Marseille FR, 2017 May; Bristol UK, 2018 Mar; all sponsored from other sources than EPSRC) and two workshops (both in Bristol, sponsored by the Leverhulme Trust) in the topics of this proposal. These events will also provide excellent opportunities for dissemination of our research achievements. 

Impact outside our scientific community: 
I have a wide teaching record across all levels of university teaching, and this has hugely benefited from active mathematical research. Continued support of our research activities thus benefits a large group of prospective and current students in higher education.

As public engagement: 
The University of Bristol is in the process of launching a bimonthly Big Science public talk series which is coordinated by the Public Engagement Team and champions the outstanding research stories in the Faculty of Science. I will also give a public talk about his research in this flagship series of public talks. Beside this, I undertook to present a talk in the very popular and prestigious series Bristol Public Talks in Mathematics.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>662565</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P003656/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>62309876-5C71-411C-B1A7-1B2907AFB5A8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Statistics &amp; Appl.
