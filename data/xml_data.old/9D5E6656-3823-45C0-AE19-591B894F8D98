Albeit a centuries old phenomenon, exile has come to represent one of the defining features of culture in the contemporary period, resulting in numerous comparative and postcolonial studies that attempt to account for its nature and influence (Steiner, Arendt, Said etc). \n\nThe case of Spanish Republican Exile (SRE) is still under-represented within comparative and cross-cultural approaches, and it is for this reason that the Centre for the Study of Hispanic Exile at Birmingham has chosen to focus primarily on SRE in order to properly situate the phenomenon within global narratives of exile in the contemporary world. Informed by the conviction that the case of Spain - where the Civil War of 1936-39 acted as a watershed in its social and political development - will offer new modes of understanding the relationships created by exile locally, transnationally and globally, the Centre has set out to create a series of resources on SRE, beginning with a searchable web resource funded by the British Academy (awarded 2007), that will benefit the whole academic community world-wide - those with a specific interest in the Spanish case and those with an interest in exile more generally.\n\nDr Buffery's project on 'Staging Exile, Migration and Diaspora in Hispanic Theatre and Performance Cultures' falls within one of the main areas defined by the Centre's broad research aims, that is the representational strategies used to (re)construct exilic memory in relation to a particular locale, the Spain that led to the dispersal, expulsion and alienation of many thousands of refugees and political exiles and the shadow it has left on contemporary Spanish society. In particular, it aims to recover and preserve the full range of reprsentation of the experience of exile in theatrical and performance texts and paratexts (histories, memoirs, reviews, criticism, photographs and audiovisual recordings), by contributing to the creation, updating and maintenance of the Centre's bibliographical database and stand-alone web resource on SRE, and by bringing together key researchers on Spanish Exile Theatre and Performance in a series of panels within the conference on 'Geographies of Exile' to be held at the University of Birmingham in 2008, with a view to publishing an edited volume on 'Stages of Exile' in 2009.\n\nAlongside this work of synthesis and dissemination of the state of contemporary research into SRE, the project will explore through a series of case studies the changing status of exile representation and production in Spanish theatre and performance cultures, as well as the effects of the continuing waves of exile, diaspora and migration on the current configuration of the Spanish stage, and the ways in which identity is performed in the spaces of Hispanic culture. The project will employ a research assistant to work on a series of discrete case studies identified in the run-up to the 2008 conference, which will be incorporated into the web resource on SRE Remains. Doctor Buffery will focus primarily on theatre and performance groups in the Catalan-speaking areas, excavating their relationship with the texts and figures associated with SRE but also addressing the ways in which current population flows have contributed to shape the space of contemporary Spanish theatre. In addition, she will organise a series of 4-6 seminars at the University of Birmingham in 2009-2010 to facilitate presentation, discussion and dissemination of work in progress on exile theatre and performance in the Department of Hispanic Studies at Birmingham, including S&amp;aacute;nchez's recovery of the figure of Jos&amp;eacute; Garc&amp;iacute;a Lora,garcia Vidal's work Galician exile theatre and marcer's on Josep Palau I Fabre's theatre.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>165901</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:id>7DBC80B2-3F79-48A7-87B0-013E954D2FD2</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>m-6568035647.802089a71349d2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Performing the Captive Land'</gtr:title><gtr:type>Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)</gtr:type></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>20-minute showing of devised performance piece based on Jos?

Most studies to date have focused primarily on theatre as a dramatic textual tradition, focusing on recovering the play-texts of dramatists in exile. There has been relatively little attention paid to the other elements and relations involved theatrical and performance cultures, and even within textual studies the emphasis has tended to be limited to the thematic. By applying a theatre and performance studies framework to the analysis of the Hispanic theatre and performance cultures produced in and by exile, migration and diaspora, it has been possible to recover and explore traces of the impact of theatrical encounters on the construction and reevaluation of identity and community, the experience and perception of the different spaces of exile, and the political and cultural embodiment of memory of the homeland, focusing on their performativity, on the way in which they open a space for memory, or contain traces or windows on environments of memory. The questions asked and case studies explored in the project often pertained to the margins of mainstream understandings of Hispanic culture. However, their very marginality contributed to throw into relief the arbitrariness of the limits of national identity and the limitations of focusing on national literary and cultural traditions, as reproduced in the predominantly monological approaches to Spanish Republican exile production. The insights afforded by translational, intercultural and theatre and performance studies approaches to the field have helped us to question and revise the models used to recover exile texts and memories, seeing theatre as a test case which pulls against the considerable &amp;quot;monologic&amp;quot; focus in Spanish Republican exile historiography on testimonial discourse about Spain, that demands greater attention to the way in which these limits are challenged and redrawn by exile experience and performance. Many of the case studies we have looked at reveal a series of shifting encounters between different languages and cultures, revealing translation zones, where concepts of culture and identity are in-translation, that is, negotiated in performance. The interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary nature of the project, combining insights and approaches from cultural history, translation and performance studies, cultural theory, memory studies, gender studies, music, dance and film helped to provide the grounds for innovative future research, as well as inspiring us to provide spaces for other researchers to participate in this crossing of boundaries, such as the performance work and Stages of Exile panel in the Spanish Republican Exile Geographies conference and the Identity in Performance symposium. These encounters produced wide-ranging reactions and engaging discussions, which often led to unexpected collaborations and have contributed to underpin future projects.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The entries made into the Centre for the Study of Hispanic Exile database on Spanish Republican exile theatre provide a wide-ranging and accessible resource for a wide specialist and non-specialist audience, and there are plans to add more text and visual objects in order to make them more attractive. At a local level, the performance work we did at the Highbury Little Theatre in Sutton Coldfield involved engagement with the immediate local community involved in maintaining the theatre, including the stage manager for Birmingham-based exile dramatist Jos? Garc?a Lora's first staged play in the 1950s, &amp;quot;Whirlwind&amp;quot;. The Javier Daulte plays directed by Anna Wilson in March 2009 reached a wide audience of local schoolchildren, teachers, academics and non-academics, and the performance elements incorporated into the March 2010 symposium on Identity in Performance were open to a wider audience of students and non-academic staff, giving them a window on to the power and creativity of Spanish Republican exile works. Since completing the project I have continued to collaborate with dramatists, performers and performance groups in interdisciplinary work of this nature, leading to fruitful public engagement in my new location at University College Cork, Ireland. Similarly, Dr Samuel Llano was able to collaborate in a new venture (the inaugural BE Group festival) to bring European performance groups to Birmingham, and has participated in BBC radio programmes on Robert Gerhard.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>6A1681D2-731F-47F8-A33E-45C3AC344C35</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-5973620364.4179775b781a</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.hispanicexile.bham.ac.uk</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Entries on 80+ dramatists, musicians, including biographies, timelines, plays, performances and bibliography.
