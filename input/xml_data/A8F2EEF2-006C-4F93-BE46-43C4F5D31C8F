The age-associated changes in bone are the major reason for number of skeletal conditions experienced by aged population in the world. Currently, more than 95% of aged population has bone problems. Aged population has difficulty in fracture healing which is an important reason for high mortality. 
Age-related changes in bone such as loss of bone-mass and blood-forming stem cells are associated with changes in the bone blood vessels (vasculature). It is still largely unknown how blood vessel growth is regulated and why they show age related changes. We found that a specific blood vessel subtype possesses the ability to support bone forming cells. We specifically lose these blood vessels with age.
We investigate the mechanisms that cause growth of these blood vessels and their age-related decline. We also understand the endothelial- derived factors involved in modifying the bone marrow microenvironment. 
We combine a wide variety of novel technologies such as high-resolution 3D imaging, intra-vital imaging and cell-specific inducible mouse genetics in an unprecedented manner to push the limits of our understanding. The study will contribute towards identifying novel therapeutic strategies for age-related bone and blood diseases.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Blood vessels form an integral part of the skeletal system exhibiting close interactions with different cell types present in the bone marrow microenvironment. Blood vessel growth in bone is coupled to osteogenesis during the development of the skeletal system. Blood vessels also provide different niches for the maintenance and proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells. 
Skeletal ageing characterised by the defective osteogenesis and haematopoiesis is associated with the changes in the bone marrow vasculature. Molecular mechanisms underlying these age-related changes in the bone vasculature and consequent changes in the BM microenvironment are not known. Recently, we identified a novel blood vessel subtype regulating osteogenesis in bone. It releases angiocrine factors to generate a specific microenvironment for bone forming osteoblasts. We also observed specific localisation of mesenchymal subsets in the stroma. Therefore, with this program, we take a completely novel approach to gain mechanistic insights into the functions of blood vessels on bone morphogenesis to understand age-related changes in the bone microenvironment, using mouse model system. First, we will investigate molecular mechanisms regulating age-related changes in the bone vasculature. We will decipher the molecular mechanisms regulating bone angiogenesis by manipulating genes in endothelial specific manner. Second, we will investigate endothelial factors regulating the status of mesenchymal cells in the bone marrow microenvironment. We are specifically interested in the angiocrine function of blood vessels that regulate age-associated changes in the bone marrow microenvironment. In this program, we will combine a wide variety of novel technologies such as high-resolution 3D imaging, intra-vital imaging and cell-specific inducible mouse genetics in an unprecedented manner to push the limits of our understanding. The study will contribute towards identifying novel therapeutic strategies for age-related bone and blood diseases.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>177527</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>723FACF9-BF7C-4D32-931E-8209075D3130</gtr:id><gtr:title>Structure and Functions of Blood Vessels and Vascular Niches in Bone.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Stem cells international</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f4c72bde34f8e45b00b12f7bc7b5833e"><gtr:id>f4c72bde34f8e45b00b12f7bc7b5833e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ramasamy SK</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a60776dbccb08.93295816</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MC_UP_1605/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
