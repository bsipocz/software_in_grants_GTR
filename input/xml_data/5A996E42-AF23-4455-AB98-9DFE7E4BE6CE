Fundamental to their activities in this period, and thus formative in their development, was a commitment to social and political engagement. The lively culture of activism and dissent on the streets of Amsterdam prompted an array of vigorous responses, including collaborations with countercultural and protest groups, campaigns and direct action against established musical institutions, disturbances of concerts, polemicising within musical works, and the advocacy of new approaches to both performance and composition.\n\nMy monograph seeks to reconstruct key phases in this history, which has tended to be mythologised in Dutch literature and is unjustly ignored in English-language musicology. But it also uses the Amsterdam scene as a case-study in the broader question of the relation of avant-garde musical practice to social change. During the sixties experimental artists often equated aesthetic and political radicalism, but in fact many tensions and dilemmas confronted those seeking to reconcile progressive social convictions with sometimes recondite artistic pursuits. To focus attention on these tensions, each chapter in my book addresses a prominent motif of radical thought in 1960s Amsterdam which laid down a particular challenge for avant-garde musicians:\n\n1. 'Creativiteit: Peter Schat's 'Labyrint' and the Situationists.' (The situationist idea of mass creativity as a tool for the legitimisation of avant-garde musicians' disavowal of authorial meanings.)\n2. 'Vernieuwing: Institutions, Money and the Idea of Democratisation.' (Avant-garde musicians' campaigns for increased institutional support evaluated against 'new left' arguments for the democratision of arts subsidy.)\n3. 'Anarchie: Provo and Polystylism.' (Avant-garde musicians' ambivalent reception of the Provo group's guiding philosophy of anarchism.)\n4. 'Politiek: Vietnam, Cuba and the Challenge to Musical Autonomy.' (How did the urge to make political statements in their works inflect avant-garde musicians' sceptical attitude to musical representation? )\n5. 'Participatie: Hippies, Students and Audiences.' (How did composers of highly organised and technically demanding concert music respond to the decade's ethos of spontaneous participation?)\n6. 'Zelfbeheer: Composers, Performers and the 'Renewal of Musical Practice'.' (The consequences of contemporary debates on labour relations for the idea of the 'composer'.)\n7. 'Volksmuziek: Louis Andriessen's 'Volkslied' and the Internationale.' (Avant-garde attempts to embrace the 'popular'.)\n\nThe audiences for my work will therefore extend beyond readers with a specific concern for Dutch music and the 1960s to anyone interested in the complex relation of aesthetics and politics. \n\nWork undertaken during this fellowship builds upon a project that is already well defined and developed. The proposed monograph represents the culmination of research undertaken over the last six years, which has already resulted in journal articles and book chapters. Chapters 4, 5 and 6 will draw from published work, but with material in some cases substantially rearranged and in every case significantly expanded. Chapter 1 is entirely new and has been almost fully drafted. Chapters 2, 3 and 7, also new, are yet to be written. The fellowship, taken together with a preceding period of institutional research leave, will allow me to undertake remaining primary research, write the new chapters, revise existing material for inclusion in the book, undertake an array of public activities intended to maximise the impact of my work, and thus bring the entire project to completion.\n\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>1. Beneficiaries: who and how\n\nMy research has demonstrable interest for a range of non-academic audiences: \na) The subjects of my work have been eager to contribute and to read drafts. My research offers increased exposure for their accomplishments, which in some cases have been little recognised outside the Netherlands. \nb) Many creative musicians (including composers and performers) remain concerned with the question of social engagement and its relation to their aesthetic preoccupations, and in this regard I hope that my research may have an impact upon new music being produced today. The interest of this creative community in my work is indicated by the fact that my last two books, which address related issues, received substantial, positive reviews in the leading modern music magazine 'The Wire', many of whose contributors and readers are practitioners. \nc) I have given public lectures on this research to concert audiences in the UK and the Netherlands, and have also contributed programme notes to concert series in the UK and the US. Louis Andriessen, one of the subjects of this research project, is recognised internationally as a leading composer, and his music is frequently programmed in many countries. My expertise is recognised as benefitting audiences for his and his contemporaries' music. \nd) Interest in my research from a wider general audience is indicated by a recent invitation to contribute to a public event on the arts and communism at Nottingham Contemporary. The intersection of artistic practices and politics is a subject of abiding fascination across the arts, and my work, by examining a lively scene little-known in this country, promises to broaden public understanding of this subject. \ne) The publishers of the composers concerned stand to benefit from renewed interest in their early activities. Boosey and Hawkes promoted my earlier book on Louis Andriessen in their quarterly newsletter, and I have enjoyed unstinting cooperation from them and from the Dutch publishers Muziek Centrum Nederland on the current project. Copies of my work are deposited in their information centres, to benefit performers and promoters researching future repertoire.\n\n2. Increasing the likelihood of impacts\n\nDuring the academic year 2010/11 I intend to optimise these benefits in the following ways: \n- I am organiser of a conference at the British Academy on 'Music and Communism outside the Communist Bloc after 1945', an event that will draw significantly upon important elements of my research. This event will be advertised to a wide non-academic audience through the Academy's publicity machinery, and the accompanying concert by the ensemble Apartment House will be publicised in new music listings and the ensemble's own website.\n- As further publicity for this event I have proposed a feature on the topic to Jeremy Evans, producer of BBC Radio 3's 'Music Matters'. I have contributed to this programme in the past, and the publication of my previous book on Louis Andriessen prompted an extended feature on the composer.\n- Music publishers and information centres provide communication opportunities through their lively websites and promotional materials. In particular, I will submit an article about my research to the 'Speakers Corner' forum on the Muziek Centrum Nederland website. This forum houses articles and debate on new Dutch music; existing contributions suggest that the forum is widely read by leading figures in Dutch musical life.\n- I will continue to accept invitations to deliver pre-concert lectures relevant to my research, as and when they arise.\n- I will explore further engagement with a general audience in Nottingham by appearing as guest speaker at the lively discussion fora The Reading Room and Cafe Scientifique.\n- My former research assistant Jochem Valkenburg is new music correspondent of the Dutch dail</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>50471</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Exhibition organisers and musicians have made use of my findings outside of HE.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>A9D07252-2C63-4F52-8262-FD2577746C50</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5440f965483b33.86104806</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The key findings are described in my book Composing Dissent.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>My research should be of interest to other musicologists, to scholars of the Netherlands and the 1960s, to composers and musicians.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>1F23D74D-9FA3-401E-BEE4-FE9B0BFFFC57</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5440f8a88f4d46.17929854</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>33A11128-9222-4F1A-BF52-E8B5E15A1150</gtr:id><gtr:title>Composing Dissent: Avant-Garde Music in 1960s Amsterdam</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9e72bd5b7d6ed824527e53b32cc3d5af"><gtr:id>9e72bd5b7d6ed824527e53b32cc3d5af</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Adlington Robert</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780199981014</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>i_30142515943bf2172e</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E55A4C13-6604-4563-B70C-00716998B07B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Music and Protest in 1968</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c8801d21a2bcc41dbd8c92c4a1a53ce9"><gtr:id>c8801d21a2bcc41dbd8c92c4a1a53ce9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Adlington R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781107007321</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>r_224299166291d39bb4</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3F3FF233-8520-485D-99DF-250B6FE931CE</gtr:id><gtr:title>Whose Voices?
