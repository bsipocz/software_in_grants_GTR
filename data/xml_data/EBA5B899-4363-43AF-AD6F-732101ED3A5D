There is a second HIV strain called HIV-2, which is mostly found in West Africa. This virus behaves quite differently from HIV-1: some HIV-2-infeceted people develop AIDS just as if they had HIV-1 but others, as many as 80%, have a normal lifespan and die of old age instead. We want to see if the immune response to the virus is different in these two groups of HIV-2-infected people, which may give useful clues about how to develop an HIV vaccine. We will be looking predominantly at cells in the blood called cytotoxic (or killer) lymphocytes because these cells have the ability to recognise and destroy HIV-infected cells.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>HIV-2 infection represents a unique model of an attenuated human retroviral infection and most (&amp;gt;80%) HIV-2 infected people will become long-term non-progressors (LTNP). However, a minority of HIV-2 infected people will develop AIDS in an identical manner to people with HIV-1: these people are distinguished by significantly higher plasma viral loads than the LTNPs. Virus-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) are considered to play an important role in the control of viral infections. There is evidence for vigorous HIV-2-specific cytotoxic T cell responses in HIV-2 infected subjects; however further studies are needed to confirm this observation and to determine whether improved viral control in the LTNPs is related to more effective CTL activity. This information will help in defining the correlates of immunity in HIV infection, which is essential for the design of vaccine and immunotherapeutic strategies.||The aim of this project is to carry out detailed characterization studies of virus specific CD8 T-lymphocyte function and phenotype in HIV-2 infection (including what viral epitopes they target, what cytokines they release, their mechanisms of cytotoxicity, and their degree of differentiation) and to relate CTL activity and phenotype to the efficiency of viral control in HIV-2 infection, by comparing LTNPs with progressors, identified by different levels of viral load in donors with normal CD4 counts. The community cohort in Caio, Guinea Bissau, where the prevalence of HIV-2 is approximately 8%, represents a unique patient population for elucidation of the difference in the immune responses between the two clinical outcome groups. A better understanding of the role of CTLs in viral control in HIV-2 infection will also shed light on the requirements for protective immunity in HIV-1 infection, which continues to spread throughout sub-Saharan Africa and the rest of the world.||The specific project aims are to:|Determine if the improved outcome in LTNPs with HIV-2 infection is due to enhanced HIV-specific CD8 T-lymphocyte immune control of viral replication, by comparing LTNPs and progressors with intact immune systems (identified by preserved CD4 counts in the normal range) and low (&amp;lt;100 copies/ml) or elevated (&amp;gt;1000) plasma viral loads (Phases I-IX)|Establish relationship between virus specific responses and viral load and CD4 count in both HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections (Phases I-IX)|Establish a relationship between HIV-2 long-term non-progressors and progressing patients by examining the breadth and magnitude of virus-specific T-cell responses using pan-genome overlapping peptide pools in ELISpot assays (Phase II) |Characterize new HIV-1 A/G and HIV-2 CTL immunodominant epitopes using an ELISpot matrix format and characterize the restriction of immunodominant equivalent epitopes in both HIV-1 and HIV-2 infected patients (Phase III-V)|Create HIV-1 and HIV-2 MHC class I tetramers for selected HLA types common in West Africa and use Peptide/Tetramer complexes to dissect the function and differentiation phenotypes of CD8 T Cell responses (Phase VI)|Compare the qualitative functional responses in HIV-1 and HIV-2 patients and evaluate the ex-vivo HIV-2-specific CD8 T-lymphocytes in LTNP and progressing patients (Phase VIII)||Establish HIV-specific CD8 T-lymphocyte clones and use them to examine HIV-2 specific CD8 T-lymphocyte receptor repertoires as well as to determine suppression of viral replication and ability to recognize HIV CTL epitope escape mutants in an in-vitro system (Phase IX)</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-02-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2005-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>128389</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MC_U190081983</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>03BA7BC9-C251-48FC-8EA9-5F7414A63FEE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Infection</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
