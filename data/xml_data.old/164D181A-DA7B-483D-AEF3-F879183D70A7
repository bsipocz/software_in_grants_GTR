fat in milk and dairy products</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>MR/K020218/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Within the UK, Europe and North America heart disease is the major cause of ill health and death. Diet has an important impact on heart disease risk and studies have shown that good dietary habits at a young age and throughout the lifespan can reduce the excessive economic and social burden associated with heart disease, by helping to prevent or delay its development. The Department of Health has dietary recommendations to reduce disease risk, principally a reduction in total saturated fat (hard fats found in processed and animal derived foods) intake. However currently, the UK population considerably exceeds this saturated fat target. Milk and milk products are one of the largest sources of dietary saturated fat, contributing about 30% of the total with cheese and butter contributing most. A common strategy to reduce saturated fat intake is to advise reduction or removal of milk and dairy products from the diet. However milk is an important food providing essential nutrients such as calcium, B vitamins and iodine, particularly important for children, young women and older adults and their reduction may lead to detrimental effects on nutritional status and health. In addition, evidence suggests that there are likely to be benefits of increased dairy food consumption such as milk in terms of lower blood pressure, reduced incidence of heart disease and some cancers, although there is limited evidence for cheese and butter. Thus simply reducing milk intake to reduce saturated fat consumption is likely to be counterproductive. Studies with humans where blood cholesterol has been measured suggest that replacing a proportion of the saturated fat in the diet with mono or polyunsaturated fats (typically found in vegetable oils) does improve their cardiovascular health value. There is now good evidence that changing the diet of the dairy cows can provide a sustainable means of producing milk with reduced saturates and increased monounsaturates, although because of the complex nature of dairy foods it cannot be simply assumed that such modified foods will reduce the risk of heart disease. Such changes to the diet of the dairy cow may also have environmental benefits as they are likely to reduce the amount of methane (a potent greenhouse gas) produced by the cow thus reducing the carbon footprint associated with milk production. This project will examine the health benefits of such modified milk and dairy products in controlled human and laboratory studies using traditional and new methods of assessing heart disease risk. In the first part of the project, dairy products with reduced saturated fats and increased monounsaturated fats will be produced by changing the cow's diet. A detailed human study will then be undertaken to assess the long and short-term effects of including these dairy products in the diet and individual meals. New, more valuable methods of assessing changes in the risk of heart disease will be included as these are thought to be more predictive than the traditional approaches relying on blood cholesterol. In the third part of this project we will complement the human studies by determining in the laboratory how the modified milk and commercial dairy products influence the health of human blood vessels, such as those found in the heart. Any benefits arising from this work will inform public health policy on optimum dietary strategies to prevent or delay the onset of heart disease.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>UK exceeds dietary targets for SFA recommended for CVD risk reduction. Milk/milk products are one of the largest sources (30% of total SFA). Recent data show likely benefits of increased milk consumption in reduced CVD risk thus consuming less milk/products to lower SFA intake may be counterproductive. Recent studies by our group (funded by BBSRC DRINC) show the potential of dairy cow nutrition to produce reduced SFA and increased cis-MUFA milk in a sustainable fashion. The hypothesis that consumption of such low-SFA dairy foods will reduce CVD risk in those at increased risk, compared with normal dairy foods, via mechanisms to increase secretion of endothelial-derived vasodilators will be tested. Initially, reduced SFA/enhanced cis-MUFA milk, cheese and butter will be produced by cow dietary changes. These modified foods will be used in double-blind, randomised, controlled, crossover chronic and acute studies with adults at increased CVD risk (n=54) to assess their effects in the background diet (12-weeks) and in test meals on biomarkers of CVD. These will include traditional (lipids and blood pressure) and novel markers (vascular function, determined by flow mediated dilatation and stiffness, pulse wave velocity), postprandial lipids, biomarkers of inflammation and vascular function (cellular adhesion molecules, endothelial progenitor cells). Furthermore, this project will use a co-culture system (human aortic smooth muscle cells overlayered with endothelial cells) which more closely mimics physiological systems, to examine the responses to plasma isolated during the acute postprandial studies on gene expression and protein levels of biomarkers of vascular function and endothelial vasodilators (including nitric oxide), providing a novel insight into mechanisms of action of low-SFA dairy products. These studies will provide unique evidence to inform public health policy on sustainable food-based dietary recommendation for CVD risk reduction.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Given the widespread consumption of milk and dairy products and the fact that they are major contributors of saturated fatty acids (SFA) in the diet, this work will have a significant impact on a wide range of beneficiaries as diverse as the general public, food production and retailing industries, the NHS and UK agriculture. Modification of milk fat composition as proposed would remove some 70,000 tonnes/year of SFA from the UK food chain. This would be a true removal rather than a movement of the SFA into other food chain entry points. Key beneficiaries include:
The public: This research will impact on the development of novel dietary and food-based strategies to reduce the risk of CVD. CVD remains the main cause of mortality and morbidity in the UK/EU and the US and is rapidly becoming a major issue in countries such as China. It has major effects on quality of life. The public would thus benefit directly from the reduced CVD risk, but also financially since less public finance would be needed for health care. CVD is estimated to cost the EU economy directly and indirectly some 200 billion EUR per year and thus even small reductions in CVD risk would have major implications on health care costs.
The consumer: Availability of SFA reduced dairy products would give consumers of all ages greater healthy food choices, without the need for dairy food exclusion.
The NHS: Diet, a major moderator of CVD risk will play an increasingly important role and lipid quality is a crucial aspect of diet. This work would make the achievement of dietary SFA reduction targets more likely leading to reduced CVD risk. This would relieve considerable pressure on the NHS both financially and resource-wise. Crucially the effect would start in childhood and would thus be preventative throughout adulthood reducing the need for pharmaceutical (e.g. statins) intervention later in life. It would provide health professionals, including dieticians, with new tools for designing healthy diets.
Food production and retailing industries: Milk and dairy companies will benefit from increased uptake of their products and retail companies will benefit from increased sales. Both will benefit from a healthy food image. This proposal includes a commercial partner Milk Link which is the UK's largest producer of cheese and supplies all major food retailers, food processors and food service organisations. It also manufactures a wide range of dairy products including long life milk and cream, extended shelf life products, flavoured milks and milk powders. Milk Link has recently announced a merger with Arla Foods and this will mean that Milk Link will become part of one of Europe's leading dairy co-operatives and dairy food producers. These companies will benefit directly from new knowledge gained from being involved in the research and in the longer term as outlined above. Moreover, as this project complements a current BBSRC/DRINC grant, feedback of findings etc will occur through DRINC members which includes major companies involved with dairy products including Danone, Kraft Foods, Nestl&amp;eacute;, Marks and Spencer and Unilever.
UK Agriculture: Whilst an increase in food production is necessary as population size increases, this must be done in ways which are sustainable and recognise the need for foods to be healthy. This work will provide opportunities for UK agriculture to achieve these aims. It will increase the need to produce home grown rapeseed, a sustainable product which will provide UK dairy farmers with feed inputs which produce healthier dairy products at a reduced carbon cost.
Government and related policy making bodies: These bodies are responsible for UK diet and health policy. They will benefit from information which can feed into future dietary policy aimed at reducing CVD risk. It will allow them to promote good health and well being through staple food intervention and provide better understanding of the link between food production and consumer health.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>783827</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Medical Research Council (MRC)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>MRC Human Nutrition Research Unit</gtr:department><gtr:description>Collaboration with MRC Human Nutrition Research Unit, Cambridge</gtr:description><gtr:id>22E221C3-D039-4556-9C74-7CAE4A94788A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>An abstract has been submitted to present some of the results at The International Society for the Study of Fatty Acids and Lipids (ISSFAL) Congress, Sept 2016.

Project Overview The FAO defines a sustainable diet as one that has a low environmental impact yet contributes to food and nutrition security and to a healthy life for present and future generations. Sustainable diets should be respectful of biodiversity and ecosystems and be culturally acceptable, accessible, economically fair and affordable, nutritionally adequate, safe and healthy - whilst optimising natural and human resources. Identifying trade-offs in production of nutritious, affordable food and the impact of this on the environment is a key challenge for the dairy industry. In the UK, there are excellent existing methodologies for measuring the impact of dairy farming on the environment, for measuring the financial cost and the nutrition quality of the UK diet. DairyCo, Dairy UK and The Dairy Council commissioned a project with the University of Reading - collaborating with ADAS &amp;amp; RAND Europe to, in Phase 1, critically evaluate existing methodologies for the measure of environmental impact, financial cost and nutrient quality of diets in the UK, and, in Phase 2, to harness these into a model that can simultaneously evaluate all elements of the FAO's definition of sustainable diet. Phase 1 is now complete. Phase 2 will be completed in March 2015. Conference Overview Academics, industry representatives and NGOs gathered in London to hear from a panel of experts who explored the progress and the challenges associated with the production of nutritious and sustainable products. Dr Judith Bryans, Chief Executive of Dairy UK, set the scene by reminding the audience that with current changes in world demographics the need to produce an increasing amount of food sustainably for a growing world population is greater than ever. Ray Keatinge, Head of Research and Development at DairyCo, overviewed the trade-offs in food production and environmental sustainability, presenting the challenges in a realistic and pragmatic manner. A key message of the conference was that a sustainable diet is not just one that has a low environmental impact, but also one that contributes to optimal nutrition and to a healthy lifestyle. Professor Ian Givens and Professor Julie Lovegrove, Professors of Food Chain Nutrition and Human Nutrition respectively at the University of Reading, presented evidence around consumption of dairy and human health. Professor Lovegrove pointed out that, although dairy products make a contribution to the nation's intake of saturated fat, research currently indicates that dairy products appear to decrease the risk of heart disease. Professor Givens commented that dairy products also contain a number of nutrients which have been shown to benefit other areas of health (e.g. bone health and foetal cognitive development).This highlights the importance of developing nutritional recommendations based on entire foods rather than on single nutrients. Dr Ditte Hobbs, Post-Doctoral Research Fellow in the Department of Food and Nutritional Sciences at the University of Reading, presented the project she is currently working on with ADAS and RAND Europe. This project involves modelling the impact of different levels of dairy consumption on affordability, nutritional adequacy and environmental impact of the entire diet. Preliminary results have found that people who consume dairy tend to have generally healthier diets (see News In Brief). The environmental indicators used in the project were explored by John Elliott, Senior Agricultural Economist at ADAS, and include greenhouse gas emissions, water utilisation and biodiversity impacts. Data will follow impacts from cradle to point of purchase and will also account for waste. Ray Keatinge commented that complex interactions are involved and that it is important to bear in mind that different agricultural methods may affect different sustainability factors (e.g. greenhouse gas emissions, energy use, biodiversity and water use). Going forward, DairyCo, Dairy UK and The Dairy Council will continue to invest in research and the implementation of industry-wide strategies to support sustainable dairy production in the UK. Brian Lindsay, Development Director for the Dairy Sustainability Framework, explained the remit of the Framework which sets environmental targets for companies worldwide and develops commitment plans to achieve the preservation of natural resources. Examples of UK farming initiatives were presented by Ray Keatinge, Head of Research and Development at DairyCo, and include the DairyCo carbon foot printing project which uses strategies such as improved energy efficiency, uptake of renewable energy and innovative feeding systems. Mr Keatinge also gave an overview of the Dairy Roadmap, which sets producer and processor targets for several items including sustainable energy and water use. Richard Laxton, Global Sustainability Manager at Arla Foods, described current dairy processing initiatives. These involve reducing the amount of carbon emissions and using water and energy in a sustainable way. He offered examples of ground-breaking innovations, such as DairyCrest Davidstow's biomass steam plant and Muller Wiseman's heat pumps which divert heat previously dispersed through cooling towers towards pasteurisation. Concluding this session, Joanna Stewart, Dairy UK's Environment Manager, gave an overview of Dairy UK initiatives, such as the Environmental Benchmarking Tool which helps member companies monitor and improve their environmental performance as well as the Global Benchmarking Project to compare the UK's performance to that of other countries.

These talks helped to raise awareness about our study and we have a few new volunteers as a result of our engagement activities.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>544a285b2298a6.22488021</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Regional conferences on Saturated Fat, Cardiff, 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C3425487-486D-4F34-B453-1AACAE46096A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Impact of dairy fat on cardiometabolic risk.

As a result of this article, we have had increased interest from the local people and a number of people have contacted us to express interest in taking part in our human study.



Dairy product consumption is often negatively portrayed in the media. Our article highlighted some of the beneficial aspects of dairy consumption, which are often forgotten. We have had a lot of interest from local individuals who are interested in taking part in the study.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>544a2e811f0f27.39217936</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs><gtr:productOutput><gtr:description>The hypothesis that consumption of such low-SFA dairy foods will reduce CVD risk in those at increased risk, compared
with normal dairy foods, via mechanisms to increase secretion of endothelial-derived vasodilators will be tested. Initially,
reduced SFA/enhanced cis-MUFA milk, cheese and butter will be produced by cow dietary changes. These modified foods
will be used in double-blind, randomised, controlled, crossover chronic and acute studies with adults at increased CVD risk
(n=54) to assess their effects in the background diet (12-weeks) and in test meals on biomarkers of CVD. These will
include traditional (lipids and blood pressure) and novel markers (vascular function, determined by flow mediated dilatation
and stiffness, pulse wave velocity), postprandial lipids, biomarkers of inflammation and vascular function (cellular adhesion
molecules, endothelial progenitor cells). The human intervention study has been underway since March 2014 and we are actively recruiting volunteers.</gtr:description><gtr:id>A4BF9945-E187-496F-83C2-23743922F717</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Any benefits arising from this work will inform public health policy on optimum dietary strategies to prevent or delay the onset of heart disease.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>544a3e21666262.54446274</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:stage>Early clinical assessment</gtr:stage><gtr:status>Actively seeking support</gtr:status><gtr:title>Reducing cardiovascular disease risk through replacement of saturated fat in milk and dairy products: the RESET study</gtr:title><gtr:type>Preventative Intervention - Nutrition and Chemoprevention</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02089035?term=lovegrove&amp;rank=3</gtr:url><gtr:yearDevCompleted>2013</gtr:yearDevCompleted></gtr:productOutput></gtr:productOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>572A48F4-04FF-4A7F-A6C9-CD4464C31747</gtr:id><gtr:title>A comparison of chronic consumption of dairy products varying in fatty acid composition on postprandial biomarkers of endothelial function: Results from the RESET study</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Proceedings of the Nutrition Society</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a9fa771c1dc1cc52641e110992d05765"><gtr:id>a9fa771c1dc1cc52641e110992d05765</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Vasilopoulou D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a9d753de08d60.71879726</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A41F4951-F642-4C23-A9E7-9DADC6C31863</gtr:id><gtr:title>Plasma phospholipid fatty acid profile confirms compliance to a novel saturated fat-reduced, monounsaturated fat-enriched dairy product intervention in adults at moderate cardiovascular risk: a randomized controlled trial.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nutrition journal</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/de98a6115339873b7df9cb01076d6492"><gtr:id>de98a6115339873b7df9cb01076d6492</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Markey O</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1475-2891</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fd2494e65d8.92475364</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>53FD8B5C-72B5-4894-A061-6BDB34480ADA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Manipulation of lipids in animal-derived foods: Can it contribute to public health nutrition?</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>European Journal of Lipid Science and Technology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/1a738ea0971a1b95428139a82dcf10ac"><gtr:id>1a738ea0971a1b95428139a82dcf10ac</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Givens D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56d016e9ac0ea5.61491258</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>64943362-4EE0-40A7-BC5F-A620401FEF88</gtr:id><gtr:title>Impact of a high-oleic sunflower oil bovine feeding regimen on the fatty acid profile of milk and dairy products</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/de98a6115339873b7df9cb01076d6492"><gtr:id>de98a6115339873b7df9cb01076d6492</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Markey O</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56b073b91039d0.45173589</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>DA1977AF-5EC8-4431-88B8-49309FB1BA0B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Impact of chronic consumption of dairy products varying in fatty acid composition on postprandial lipid responses: preliminary insights from the RESET study</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Proceedings of the Nutrition Society</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/de98a6115339873b7df9cb01076d6492"><gtr:id>de98a6115339873b7df9cb01076d6492</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Markey O</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0029-6651</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a3602bb32c1e3.38278331</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>EC64DBC7-1994-4D3B-9320-338F650412C9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Milk and dairy products: good or bad for human health?
