Current treatments for asthma attacks are not very effective and new and better treatments are urgently needed. Viral respiratory infections often cause asthma attacks and bacterial respiratory pathogens (disease producing micro-organisms) have also been associated with asthma attacks. However, current guidelines recommend antibiotic therapy should NOT routinely be given as the role for bacteria is uncertain. We have shown previously that adults experiencing an asthma attack showed a significantly greater reduction in symptoms , improvement in lung function (both 50-100% greater) and faster recovery (5 days vs 8) when given a particular antibiotic (Telithromycin) compared to placebo ('dummy' treatment). This treatment had a clear benefit, however safety concerns have limited the use of Telithromycin to life-threatening infections. We would therefore like to investigate whether or not Azithromycin, which is a safe and well tolerated alternative antibiotic, similar to Telithromycin and that has been used for many years in the treatment of respiratory disease, might be of benefit in asthma exacerbations. This data will provide a clear evidence base for future guidelines. In addition we would like to study 1) how frequently bacteria are detected in asthma exacerbations and 2) the mechanisms by which antibiotics improve recovery from an asthma exacerbation in order to have a clearer understanding of how exacerbations are triggered and therefore how to treat them. We hope this work will also help identify who may benefit most from such treatment. This study will investigate the effectiveness of Azithromycin used in addition to standard treatment for patients with acute attacks of asthma. We will enrol a total of 380 patients requesting acute medical care for an asthma attack, across 10 UK hospitals. They will be randomised to receive either Azithromycin or a placebo (double-blind). The effectiveness of Azithromycin will be assessed by differences in symptom diary cards, lung function tests and quality of life questionnaires completed by the patient. Differences will be compared at 10 days after randomisation in the treatment and placebo group and statistics used to determine if these changes are significant. The research team we have put together for this application has very extensive experience of research into the causes of asthma attacks and the Chief Investigator has previous experience of studying an antibiotic in a randomised trial investigating asthma attacks. We therefore believe we have the appropriate experience and knowledge to meet the objectives of this trial. Funding is needed for essential personnel to coordinate and manage the trial, for statistical analysis and laboratory analysis, as well as for staff to recruit the patients into the trial at each hospital.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Design: Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Population: Adults with a history of asthma presenting within 24 hrs (of initial presentation requesting acute medical care) with an acute exacerbation of asthma (increased wheeze, dyspnoea and/or cough with reduced Peak Expiratory Flow - PEF). Full inclusion/exclusion criteria are provided in the protocol. Intervention: Azithromycin 500mg or placebo once daily (OD) for 3 days. Outcomes: Primary: diary card asthma symptom score assessed at 10 days. Secondary: asthma symptoms, lung function and quality of life assessed at 5 &amp;amp; 10 days, time to 50% reduction in symptoms, time trends in primary and secondary outcomes over the exacerbation time course up to 10 days. Assessments and follow up: The assessments that will be carried out on patients are diary card summary symptom score, pulmonary function tests, quality of life questionnaires, nasal mucus/sputum standard bacterial culture, respiratory virus, atypical bacterial PCR panel, serological status for atypical bacterial infection. The assessments will take place at follow up visits for the patients at 5 and 10 days after randomisation with a final convalescent follow up appointment at 42 days following randomisation. Sample size: 380 patients. The sample size calculation is based on the primary outcome in TELICAST: our previous study found mean decreases in symptom score of 1.3 in treatment group, and 1 in the control group, resulting in the clinically significant difference of -0.3 (SD 0.783) between the groups at 10 days (end of treatment). Using a two-sided t-test at 1% significance level with 80% power we would need 161 patients in each group to be able to detect the same difference in asthma scores between the groups. The significance level of 1% in the above calculation was chosen to provide additional certainty in the primary outcome, and to give extra power to the planned exploratory subgroup analyses. Taking into account the drop-out rate of 15% in the study, we propose to recruit 190 patients in each arm of the study. To be able to run the trial within the project timelines, we have recruited 10 centres. Statistical analysis: Primary efficacy endpoints will be analysed using a 2-level hierarchical model (centre and patient as the two levels). The model will include treatment, study centre and any predefined covariates. Analysis will be by intention to treat. Project timetables including recruitment rate: The study will start June 1st 2011 for finalising ethics applications and R&amp;amp;D approvals, recruitment of Trial Committee personnel, development of Case Report Forms, and training of trial personnel. Recruitment will start on 1st Sept 2011 and will recruit for 1 year. Laboratory analyses, data cleaning, analysis and reporting will take a further 9 months. All centres have audited adult asthma A &amp;amp; E attendances and have &amp;gt;300 per year. Some will be ineligible, but we believe 38 per centre is achievable (rate required is 3.2 per centre per month).</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1418224</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>ATS San Francisco - Poster Discussion</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>30FBDDFB-0918-4020-983E-F3BCD2809A99</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A Randomised, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study to Evaluate the Efficacy of Oral Azithromycin (500 Mg OD) as a Supplement to Standard Care for Adult Patients with Acute Exacerbations of Asthma (the AZALEA Trial)</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6a7865309c1.68169625</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>MRC Centenary Celebration (Science Festival &amp; Open Week, June 2013)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B561FF72-3FD1-4D3E-A0E5-80C8C20B4B77</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Centre took part in the MRC Centenary Celebrations on 15th-16th June 2013 (Science Festival at the Science Museum) and on 20th June 2013, when we organised a day-time event as part of the Centenary Open Week.


Some outcomes of our Open Day event on 20th June 2013 by the Observation Point in London's South Bank:

? 12ft inflatable lungs from The Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation were probably our most significant model for the Open Week event. Centre scientists worked in shifts, presenting the anatomy and function of normal lungs and also spoke of lung diseases
? Asthma themed sand sculptures on the banks of Thames were of great interest. MRC Centenary hash tag #100mrc was also drawn in sand
? The desk size balloon model of lungs demonstrated how lungs work in a healthy individual and what happens in the lungs of asthmatics
? Members of the public were introduced to most common allergens at home ('Allergen House' poster game with magnetic allergens). Allergens such as dustmites and mold were placed in rooms where one would most likely encounter them. Afterwards scientists corrected the answers and explained the reasons why
? We ran an interactive game of Respiratory Olympics where peoples' lung capacities were measured using a spirometer. Men and women competed in different categories and the biggest lung capacity in each category won a prize, which was a pair of tickets to the Open East Festival (the first official opening of the Olympic Park since the 2012 Olympics)
? Overall we felt that our event was very well received, judging by the footfall and the fact that we did not experience many quiet moments. We felt that people were interested in our work and found our research of great significance

Other information:

? Collaboration and interaction with our partners (MRC, Asthma UK, Imperial and King's Colleges) as well as the other London based MRC Centres
? The Biomedical Research Centre (BRC) and the British Society for Immunology (BSI)
? Great learning exposure and enthusiasm for the Centre trainees (students and Post Docs)
? Our Open Day event was attended by Dr. Alfred William Frankland, one of the early pioneers of allergen immunotherapy 
? Asthma UK Visit on12th Nov 2013 to the Centre Headquarters. Asthma UK have since requested further events for patients and donors. There are likely to be some as yet unknown impacts.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>BeDoFMmswfB</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:presentationType>Workshop Facilitator</gtr:presentationType><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.centenary.mrc.ac.uk/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3BCF06B0-CBAA-45F5-9A40-F26BF380D9C1</gtr:id><gtr:title>Azithromycin for Acute Exacerbations of Asthma : The AZALEA Randomized Clinical Trial.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>JAMA internal medicine</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5638cdb8eec944bcf9fe079c92dd7fe8"><gtr:id>5638cdb8eec944bcf9fe079c92dd7fe8</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Johnston SL</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2168-6106</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58c28ac8147d98.42602994</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>99E540D1-5BDF-45A2-8585-86649DE77F89</gtr:id><gtr:title>Host DNA released by NETosis promotes rhinovirus-induced type-2 allergic asthma exacerbation.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nature medicine</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d4eeed7b7d1f03fb9de82b125ee80de2"><gtr:id>d4eeed7b7d1f03fb9de82b125ee80de2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Toussaint M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1078-8956</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a578d2dc6a585.45019188</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>324E1D86-EC80-46B7-822A-475089070110</gtr:id><gtr:title>Article</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Efficacy and Mechanism Evaluation</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/3370af1dc9c7c39bc22162828b2f26b5"><gtr:id>3370af1dc9c7c39bc22162828b2f26b5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Johnston, SL</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>56dee2b1ccbc43.11367745</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MC_PC_11005</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>03BA7BC9-C251-48FC-8EA9-5F7414A63FEE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Infection</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>E3CED108-9B11-45C4-A81B-3730D641CA68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Respiratory</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>74DC189C-F240-42D1-84DD-85475A95ABE8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>6.7  Physical</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
