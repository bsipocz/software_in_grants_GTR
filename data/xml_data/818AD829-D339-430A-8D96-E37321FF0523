This six-month project will conduct an initial analysis of the contributions and value of engineering and physical sciences research and EPSRC investments towards achieving a Resilient Nation and through that analysis explore options for continuing to promote and enhance their value to the nation.

A strong knowledge exchange team has been brought together to delivery this proposal. The proposed Resilient Nation Champion, researcher and administrator have worked with EPSRC (and other research councils) in delivering the Adaptation and Resilience in the Context of Change (ARCC) network and related activities that over the past 9 years has engaged with research, policy and practitioner communities across the UK to understand and enhance the impacts of research, and the quality and relevance of that research. 

The knowledge and skills developed leading that network will be used to identify relevant research projects and programmes and to engage with EPSRC portfolio managers and researchers to explore their understanding of their contributions to building a resilient nation. This understanding will be used to pilot communication and engagement mechanisms with the aim of increasing awareness of current engineering and physical sciences research and pathways for investments, and thereby helping to demonstrate their benefits. It is also intended that the resulting engagement and understanding will lead to increased understanding by researchers of the benefits of applying their skills and knowledge to meet the challenges facing the UK now and in the future. 

The results of this initial analysis will then be used to identify options and recommendations for taking this work forward to support the EPSRC in realising its aspirations recognising the contributions from engineering and physical sciences to building a resilient nation</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Impact Summary

A Resilient Nation helps provide all citizens with sustainably-managed resources, reliable infrastructure and the ability to combat both natural and man-made threats.
This work to enhance the understanding and recognition of recent and current research on resilience across the EPSRC portfolio (methods, tools, data) will help identify contributions to achieving this through excellent engineering and physical sciences which support the products, processes and technology required to effect economic and social change.

Immediate beneficiaries include: 
- EPSRC portfolio managers: who will gain additional information to add to their knowledge of where and how current research from across the portfolio contributes to becoming a Resilient Nation, and options and recommendations for a way forward to help inform future investment strategies and decisions.
- Other relevant funding agencies (including RCUK, UKRI and the RIDE Forum): that will benefit from knowledge of relevant links and synergies at the interface with the EPSRC portfolio of research, and information to support possible cross-agency programme development in the future. 
- Academic community: that will benefit from the sharing of knowledge and understanding of the value of their research with respect to resilience, and input into 

Longer-term beneficiaries include:
- Policy and practice communities: that will benefit from this initial work to develop engagement and communication strategies to better reflect the (potential) contribution of evidence from the engineering and physical sciences to support action and decision-making.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>46302</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R02412X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
