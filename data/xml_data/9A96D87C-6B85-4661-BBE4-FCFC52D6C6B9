One of the primary causes of the decline in the high street is the emergence of online shopping. This project aims to use mobile technology to bring the data-rich environment shoppers are used to online, to the convenience and service offered by the high street. Through augmented reality, shoppers will get a more engaging experience which is underpinned by real-time, location specific offers from any retailer on the high street. The use of augmented reality, provision of offers and tracking their redemption will provide real-time data for retailers and authorities to understand shopping habits and to better refine and promote the high street offering. This feedback loop will have a positive effect on shopper, retailer and authority behaviour.

Imagine... 
? Walking down a high street where every shop front was (when viewed through a smart phone) a ?virtual billboard? displaying offers and what is new in store. 
? Now imagine that the offers selected for display varied for each shopper, matched to their profile and purchasing habits. Real-time, personalised, location specific direct marketing that could include video and other augmented reality experiences as well as communicating offers.
? When the shopper walks into a store, their mobile also brings alive items on the shelves, or highlights other items they might be interested in, through detailed information, images, videos and commentary. They can even share their likes on social media and leave feedback for the store or high street.
? Link this with a mobile vouchering platform that enables the shopper?s offers to be redeemed in store, and for the platform to record those transactions and learn the purchasing habits of the different shoppers to further refine targeting in the future.
? Behind the scenes, the store has a dashboard which shows them in real-time what shoppers have been looking at and when, what offers they have used and their feedback and ratings. Even local authorities can see what is happening with a dashboard that shows them the health of the high street.

The shopper simply needs to download the mobile application, register (they do not even need to provide name and address, simply post code, age, sex and number of children); it is an opt-in service. They benefit from communications and offers tailored to them as a single source for any high street. The retailer benefits from building personal relationships with their customers and high streets potential reverse their decline.
