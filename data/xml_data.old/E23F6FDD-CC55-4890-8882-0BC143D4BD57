Against this milieu of gay interracial compatibility, evidence abounded of racism within LGBT communities. Gay 'visibility,' in the form of increased media coverage, exposed the inequities within queer cultures and the dominance of urban gay white male norms. The mythical pink pound and almighty gay dollar, available to just a few, in fact obscured the great disadvantages facing most LGBT people in the workplace and in domestic life. New institutions emerged, however, to promote intercultural cooperation among LGBT persons. They not only fostered interpersonal relationships across boundaries of race, ethnicity, and nationality, but also combated racism, sexism, and classism more broadly. At the beginning of the new millennium, what forces lay behind this heightened awareness of race and its consequences for queer communities?\n\nIntertwining the realms of representation and lived experience, this project examines the historical contexts for these phenomena, as well as their contemporary iterations. In nine chapters, the monograph first probes recent controversies surrounding photographic representations, as with the summer 2005 exhibition 'Icons of the Gay Community'; grass roots campaigns, including the 2004 OutRage! protests against Jamaican 'murder music' and the MOBO (Music of Black Origins) awards; and popular stage performances, radio shows, and internet animations, including the 2002 boycott of blackface drag artist Shirley Q. Liquor. As historical backdrop, racist stereotypes and cultural practices are pinpointed in the most influential of gay sex manuals, The Joy of Gay Sex, published in multiple editions since 1976.\n\nPart two of the book juxtaposes the cultural invention of gay racial hierarchies against social histories of interracial relationship building. A close reading of the popular independent film Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss (1998) exposes emerging norms of beauty and standards of desirability privileging young gay white men over older men of color. By contrast, additional chapters interrogate East-West scholarship funds which, from the 1950s, brought young Asian men to U.S. universities and into the homes of their older white male companions, as well as queer marriages of convenience, the creative coupling and collective householding designed to circumvent immigration controls and bring together various white/non-white, citizen/'alien' partners and trios into new relations of kinship.\n\nThe book's final part charts the rise of gay organizations and networks enabling intercultural interaction, coalition, and struggle. Departing from dominant psychoanalytic frames of racial fetishization, oral histories allow the articulation of life stories by men of color engaged in interracial liaisons. And visual/textual analysis is brought to bear on explicitly multiracial HIV/AIDS awareness campaigns. The book closes with a comparative history of the Long Yang Club International (LYC) and Black and White Men Together (BWMT). Founded in London in 1983, now with thirty-five chapters in nine countries, the former envisions social bridge-building in terms both continental and hemispheric, with frequent references to 'East-West' relations. Formed in 1980, with the majority of its thirty-plus chapters in the United States, the latter views its mission as both social and political, emphasizing, as they attempt to overcome, categories of race and ethnicity.\n\nIn sum, through an analysis of cultural production and social history, the project argues a historical transformation in queer engagements with racial difference, from cataloguing and occasionally condemning various white/non-white dyads, viewed hierarchically through the fetish and discourses of colonialism, to a queer cosmoplitanism, embracing multiple types and multiple intimacies.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>35000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>An extensive summary was provided in my &amp;quot;final&amp;quot; report, six years ago, which was approved by the AHRC and which was my last remaining *contractual* obligation to the AHRC. I encourage you to dig that up.

In short: I promised to complete a monograph manuscript, and I did. Ten chapters plus intro and epilogue, 80,000 words, excluding notes and such. Chicago sent it out to readers, who responded favorably, and the press offered me a contract. I declined it.

Why? Because I lost all connection to the project, through constant administrative nightmares such as this one. More specifically, in the interim, my institution forced me to take up a departmental headship and forced me to decline an AHRC Knowledge Transfer Fellowship opportunity (Remember quaint &amp;quot;KT&amp;quot;? Now it's &amp;quot;impact&amp;quot;), during a time of &amp;quot;restructuring.&amp;quot; (Read: management failure.)

Over the summer (when many imagine we somehow relax or do research), I served on a School-wide working group on &amp;quot;academic and financial sustainability.&amp;quot; That is: Who gets cut? We recommended no one, with compelling evidence (wheedled from recalcitrant bureaucrats) to show that ordinary attrition and retirements--combined with a strict hiring freeze--would meet the (likely invented) budgetary shortfall within three years. Our extensive recommendations, well-researched and painstakingly exact, were voided. Instead, hiring continued during this purported period of austerity, including an utterly corrupt spousal hire by the very Head of School implementing redundancies. 

Meanwhile, our Principal (who had built himself a lovely penthouse atop the former PRO) helped privatize UK higher education, shifting the burdens for his luxuries from ordinary taxpayers to 18-year-olds. He was duly gonged and sent out to pasture (e.g., the wine cellars) in Oxford.

Needless to say, it was a time of unusual difficulties, even by our antiquated inefficient corrupt standards. One colleague in an allied department signed his redundancy package, after much hesitation and duress, then went home that very night and died. RIP David Nokes.

My department of 7 academic staff (majority female, near majority non-white) was reduced to 4 (all white, half male)--giving the lie to our &amp;quot;widening participation.&amp;quot; After carefully closing a successful department and degree programmes--reassuring countless parents and students through emergency SSLC meetings and so on--my colleagues and I were subjected to a program review, much like this review, long after the fact, unnecessary, duplicating and triplicating work previously undertaken at great pains and great sacrifice to our research and teaching agendas.

This is why researchers find it nigh impossible to publish. Our system is badly badly broken, and as our Vice Principal conceded, in a rare moment of honesty, we are rearranging deck chairs (as with the AHRC and other funding councils forever shifting their work onto us).

(For the record, I've published three peer-reviewed articles from this project--one already on this system with Annals of Scholarship--two forthcoming 2015 in edited collections from NYU and Florida Press. I made a half-dozen conference presentations, plus mainstream media pieces, etc.)</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2009</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>4F0C3EB8-7A82-4BC3-8A9E-9ABA22441BDA</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545b1722085bf7.65931354</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>624576F7-3173-4F6C-B8B8-C399005D93BE</gtr:id><gtr:title>Shirley Q.
