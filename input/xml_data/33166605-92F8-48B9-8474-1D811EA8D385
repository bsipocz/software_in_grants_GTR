We are seeking AHRC funding for initiatives that will inspire new research and make existing research accessible to communities of practice as well as to the general public, and bring scholars and performers together to develop innovative collaborative research, including practice-based and practice-led research. Our proposal is for the following interrelated projects: 
1) A series of four international interdisciplinary workshops. The first will be a 'scoping' exercise (laying the project's groundwork); the other three led by acknowledged experts from outside fiddle and dance studies will focus on cognitive psychology (how music and dance are related to memory), performance studies (how we remember music and dance through our bodies and how music and dance inspire memories), and digital humanities (how we can use digital technologies to document and later recall music and dance traditions). 
2) A public lecture series building on Workshops II and III, with featured speakers from academic, performance, and heritage contexts.
3) A website platform hosting a variety of relevant content and interactive features, including:
a. The publication of all previous and future North Atlantic Fiddle Convention (NAFCo, see below) conference proceedings online as open source publications, enabling a cumulative bibliography with hyperlinks where available;
b. An interactive moderated online forum to enable informal discussion among scholars, performers and other individuals, as well as research questions and observations seeded by keynote presenters;
c. An annotated list of relevant URLs/websites;
d. Video content featuring keynote presentations, workshops, and short, accessible 'snappers' describing and illustrating North Atlantic fiddle and dance research. 
4) A project coordinator who will work with the two co-applicants to organise the various project elements, and who will engage stakeholders through social media and the interactive online forum (above), and will work with broadcast media in both Scotland and Canada to maximize the project's audience.
The North Atlantic Fiddle Convention is a uniquely structured event involving scholarly presentations, practical workshops, and live performance events, which brings together scholars and practitioners of fiddling, dance and related musical forms. NAFCo has been held every few years since 2001, in Aberdeen (2001, 2006, 2010), in Derry/Londonderry and Donegal (2012), and in St John's, Newfoundland (2008). The 2015 convention in Cape Breton will provide the springboard for our project. The project will culminate in 2017 when NAFCo returns to Aberdeen. Although new scholars and performers attend each NAFCo event, many delegates have participated in several, or even all, of the previous conventions. Consequently, an informal network of North Atlantic fiddle and dance scholars has emerged. With our proposal, we aim to be more deliberate in developing the network, creating opportunities for the network to interact, collaborate, and extend research in North Atlantic fiddle and dancing in innovative ways.
The project will benefit scholars, musicians, dancers, related stakeholders (e.g. archives, museum, and festival personnel), and the general public. The workshops and lecture series will involve both experts and participants from these various sectors, enriching collaborative research possibilities, inspiring new research projects, and motivating new research applications. The virtual resources will ensure that the network will continue to develop outside the face-to-face events while enabling those who could not attend them to participate as well.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our proposed project will benefit not only academic researchers, but musicians, dancers, industry stakeholders, amateur scholars, and the general public. People from each of these sectors will be invited to participate in the proposed workshops and lecture series, and these events will be constructed to enable their differing perspectives and concerns to be heard. The proposed virtual resources will be open to all and will facilitate discussions among a broad and diverse community interested in fiddle and dance traditions, and create the conditions that will allow existing research to be applied in practical contexts as well as inspiring new research. By spotlighting three disciplinary approaches to memory from outside of fiddle and dance studies (cognitive psychology, performance studies, and digital humanities), we will create a coherent focus around which a diverse fiddle and dance studies network can coalesce.
 Practitioners will benefit from research presentations that may inform their performance practices. Artists involved in music-making in the community will gain a deeper understanding of how the brain works in respect of memory and how it might affect their performance and practice, e.g. when working with people suffering from dementia. Similarly music teachers working with young people, e.g. through F&amp;egrave;is Rois, would be better placed to appreciate the value of memorisation from oral tradition and how web-based input might create new modes of learning. Interaction with and exposure to performers from other fiddle and dance traditions will deepen their understanding of the distinctive qualities of their own traditions and create the conditions through which future artistic collaborations could develop. They will have the opportunity to articulate performance-related issues that could inform future research projects. 
 Because of the nature of the networking project bringing together theory and practice, Arts/Heritage officers employed by the local and natioal bodies as well as those from third sector organisations involved in community education will be able to appreciate better how fiddle music and dance can contribute to the well-being of communities and groups. In this respect, policy in the arts and heritage sector as well as in social welfare will be influenced. For example, tutors of Scottish Culture and Traditions which runs over 20 classes a week for adults in traditional music-making and dance in Aberdeen will benefit in their approach to social inclusion, particularly their work with adults who have learning difficulties and are socially marginalised. 
 Industry stakeholders will benefit from current research which may inform their work in diverse ways. Those in the music and tourism industries will be exposed to new performers while research will assist them to contextualize the artists with whom they work (e.g. in liner notes and concert programmes). Representatives of the music industry, such as CD producers and festival directors, will be better placed to appreciate the value of the innovative initiatives and collaborations that will emerge to their own commercial and artistic development.
 The general public has long demonstrated an interest in traditional music and dance, evident in significant attendance numbers at a plethora of folk music and dance festivals, fiddle camps and schools, folk/trad music industry awards events, fiddle and dance competitions, and concerts. 
 The networking project will provide, through the workshops, lecture series, and virtual resources, clear foci and pathways to inquiry regarding fiddle and dance traditions, their development, the creative synergies that will emerge, and how these can be resourced and energised. Participants in the project will be empowered by the interdisciplinarity of the approaches and the relevance to communities of practice, industry personnel, and an interested public.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-01-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-01-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>35375</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop on the Contribution of Cognitive Psychology to Research in the Field of Fiddle and Dance Studies</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0B47BE8A-803C-464E-BDBE-81F9ED85EF47</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Hoping that our AHRC Networking grant application would be successful, we conducted a scoping exercise during the North Atlantic Fiddle Convention hosted by Cape Breton University in October 2015 in order to identify areas the networking project might explore. As a result, when we were advised of our application's success, we were ready to start planning workshops immediately.
1. The first AHRC workshop was held in Aberdeen on 9-10 June 2016. It was addressed by Professor David Rubin, Duke University, who looked at the role Cognitive Psychology might play in studies of fiddle music and dance. Other main presenters included Dr Byron Dueck of the Open University, Dr Colin Quigley of Limerick University, and Jo Miller of the University of Sheffield (a practitioner). The attendance was 24 including academics and non-academic practitioners. The event was live-streamed and 44 people participated on line. Subsequently the filming has been accessed by over 100 viewers. It remains available to download and view.
2. The second AHRC workshop will be held in Aberdeen on 27-28 April 2017. It will be addressed by Prof. Timothy Tangherlini of UCLA to explore the contribution that Digital Humanities can bring to fiddle and dance studies. Other main presenters are Dr Gaila Kirdiene of the Lithuanian Academy of Music, Dr David McGuinness of the University of Glasgow, and Dr Pat Ballantyne of the University of Aberdeen. All three are academics and practitioners. To date there are 18 delegates who have accepted the invitation to participate.
3. The third AHRC workshop will take place in Sydney, Cape Breton, on 5-6 October 2017, and will explore the contribution of Performance Studies to the field of research. The keynote presenter is Prof. Anna Birch of the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c7e08c4f3952.22170698</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.abdn.ac.uk/nafco/workshop-1/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2007,2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Networking through Social Media to Raise Awareness among Practitioners and Academics of Activities, Developments, and Research in the Field of Fiddle and Dance Studies through the Blog</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0021AA9C-D541-4AD7-A064-75603F01C058</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We have established a NAFCo blog with monthly posts by a mix of international scholars and practitioners.

1. Although social media had been used to promote individual iterations of the North Atlantic Fiddle Convention in previous years, we now have a permanent and regularly updated Facebook page associated with NAFCo. This has created a dynamic channel through which to connect with and build our network of scholars and practitioners. We are gradually building our following, with new 'likes' every week. We post new, original content on a regular basis, in addition to recycling posts and information of interest to our network. Posts regularly reach many times the number of Facebook page followers we have, clearly indicating interest in our content. We have been posting two types of original content: 1) links to NAFCo blog posts (Heather Sparling's blog post reached over 4,000 people and was shared 16 times); and 2) short 'snapper' videos of NAFCo delegates at the 2015 convention, featuring research or performance techniques (Sherry Johnson and April Verch's video reached over 11,000 people and was shared 70 times). Our Facebook page offers an easy-to-find and accessible means of discovering NAFCo with links to our blog and website. We are also using it to promote our workshops to encourage attendance and to share results.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c7e251587c87.99769840</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.facebook.com/North-Atlantic-Fiddle-Convention-1614544258828969/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016,2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/N003160/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7B8CDA14-FE2F-4F7C-BCD4-87F84927DAC0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Dance</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>38E9B207-EFC4-4B48-AF70-C67AC5978934</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Drama &amp; theatre studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>0AEFDABE-67A4-48B1-9DB4-99393BDE6065</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Music</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E457FFDE-A4C1-4907-AE12-A394D95A3AE5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cognitive Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FC2FB132-EBA5-4745-B339-CA9BD46FFD5C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Dance Performance</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>55773495-BB0B-43EB-B99D-D5C15272A52F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Musical Performance</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9BB7B92A-CA2F-416A-8A6C-ED65BF575E45</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Performance &amp; Live Art</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D417837F-1924-4F1E-875B-A160B88B4C98</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Traditional Music</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
