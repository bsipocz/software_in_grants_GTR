Gabapentinoid-sensitive Auxiliary Alpha2-Delta Subunits</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>G0700381</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>All functions that maintain life, such as breathing, movement, and thinking, depend upon communication between the cells and tissues that comprise organisms. Such communication depends upon electrical signals that regulate the amount of calcium that enters cells using cell surface components called calcium channels. Malfunction in calcium channels causes many diseases including heart failure and epilepsy. Recently, a very powerful and safe group of drugs called gabapentinoids have been developed that correct many calcium channel malfunctions, but it is unclear how they work. Very recent studies show these drugs modulate a calcium channel component called the alpha2-delta subunit. Unfortunately, what this subunit does is also unclear. Based on evidence showing that alpha2-delta delivers calcium channels to the cell surface and keeps them there, we think that it gathers calcium channels at sites where cells contact each other and that gabapentinoids somehow affect this process. Using sophisticated microscopes, techniques to measure calcium channel activity and tools we have developed, we now plan to test this notion by looking at how alpha2-delta interacts with other regions of calcium channels and with cell surface components involved in cell contact. By also seeing how gabapentinoids affect these events, we think we will be able to supply the information needed to develop new and better calcium channel drugs capable of treating the large number of, often very serious, diseases they are associated with.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Calcium entry through voltage-gated calcium channels (Cavs) has a pivotal role in diverse cellular processes including muscle contraction, neuronal excitability, gene expression. Aberrant Cav function is implicated in numerous conditions including cardiac arrhythmias, epilepsy, migraine, neuropathic pain. Thus, a definition of the mechanisms that regulate calcium entry through Cavs is crucial to cell biology and medicine alike. Cavs are multi-subunit complexes comprised of a pore-forming alpha1 and two modulatory subunits: alpha2-delta and beta. The alpha2-delta subunit is now known to play a major role in epilepsy, neuropathic pain and possibly oncogenesis and is the primary target of the safe and clinically effective anti-epileptic and anti-nociceptive gabapentinoid drugs. Unfortunately, the mechanisms of action of gabapentinoids and their alpha2-delta subunit targets are unknown. Based on recent evidence showing a role for alpha2-delta in Cav trafficking and its structural homology with integrins that mediate cell-cell signalling, we hypothesize that alpha2-delta assembles and stabilizes Cavs at the cell surface through interactions with the extra-cellular matrix. This project aims to a) Define the sites of interaction between alpha2-delta and alpha1 subunits, b) Identify interactions of alpha2-delta with components of the extra-cellular matrix and c) Obtain a complete description of the synthesis and assembly of Cavs and the role of alpha2-delta, the ECM and gabapentinoid binding in such events. By defining the function of alpha2-delta as a molecular target for gabapentinoids, we aim to provide the missing knowledge required for developing a rational pharmacology of gabapentinoids and Cav modulatory drugs in an internationally competitive and timely manner.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-04-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-01-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>583652</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>MedImmune</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Astrazeneca/Medimmune</gtr:description><gtr:id>B336AF9F-CB50-4514-9DD1-0C5E0547792E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>No scientific outputs as yet from direct AZ funding.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>CR9s5NFFipi-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>AZ/Medimmune have committed &amp;pound;15600 to fund a technician for 6 months to address key questions relevant to development of the R domain as a drug target. As part of this collaboration, we will be using AZ/Medimmune facilities and expertise to develop our work. Currently, we have a verbal commitment to a minimum contribution of &amp;pound;50K towards a forthcoming joint MICA application (Jan/Apr 2013). Both parties are keen to establish a long-term partnership to develop alpha2delta as a major drug target.

In 2013 we collaborated briefly with our colleagues in Assay Development (AZ, Alderley Park) in efforts to produce high yields of calcium channel proteins, including alpha2delta, to be used for binding assays to characterise the archetypal alpha2delta-calcium channel interaction. The aim was to use the results to gain further insights into the biology of alpha2delta and to develop an assay to screen candidate compounds for their ability to disrupt the alpha2delta- calcium channel interaction. Initial attempts to obtain sufficient yields of protein using our UoM constructs and new constructs generated by AZ were largely unsuccessful. With the announcement that the Alderley Park site would close, momentum for this work was lost. Internal application for an AZ-funded posdoctoral position for 2 years was also unsuccessful and for the moment the collaboration is on hold.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Our discovery of the region of the calcium channel alpha2delta subunit that controls its effects on calcium channels (the R domain) constitutes an entirely new modus operandi for calcium channel function and provides a major new locus for therapeutic intervention. Our goals for the partnership are to develop the R domain as a drug target and to continue research into the greater biology of alpha2delta in order to define further therapeutic targets.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Bristol</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Bristol Collaboration: Cardiac calcium channel alpha2delta project</gtr:description><gtr:id>886649E0-004A-4892-BB9E-CBA76292EA0C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Other than hosting a Bristol-based PhD student for a short period in 2010, this work has not led to any hard outputs.

Physiology &amp;amp; Pharmacology, Faculty of Medical &amp;amp; Veterinary Sciences, University of Bristol. The Bristol team have given us access to cardiac myocytes to study the localisation/targeting of endogenous cardiac calcium channel alpha2delta subunit. We have no expertise in cardiac physiology/tissue culture whilst the Bristol team have little/no experience in molecular biology. Together, we have shared expertise and information to begin to investigate the role of native calcium channel alpha2delta subunits in targeting cardiac calcium channels to t-tubules. Thus, the collaboration has opened up a new avenue for applying our cellular and molecular biology techniques in a clinically relevant native system. Our aim is to write a joint project grant to develop this work further. In this respect, the Bristol team have generously allowed us to take the lead as PIs, in recognition of our cell/molecular biology expertise.

These will be used initially in affinity precipitation assays to be carried out at UoM. Our AZ colleagues are also developing a novel strategy to make modified versions of our constructs to be used in surface plasmon resonance assays. These latter assays will provide more detailed information on binding affinities and kinetics of specific Rd-Cav interactions. We aim to use these data to refine our cell-based assays so that we can measure the functional effects of Rd-Cav binding in a cellular context. Ultimately, we aim to develop high through-put assays to screen for candidate compounds that target the Rd-Cav interaction. At present, AZ (Discovery Sciences) is funding all the work carried out at Alderley Park. In an effort to consolidate the collaboration and speed up progress, have submitted a joint application for an AZ-funded postdoctoral position (2 years) dedicated to this project (application deadline 14/11/13).</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Based on our original identification of the alpha2delta R domain (Rd) as the region that binds to calcium channels (Cav) we are now in the process of characterising the interaction to gain information critical to enable exploitation of the therapeutic potential of our discovery. We have developed an extensive library of alpha2delta expression constructs for use in a variety of cell-based assays that are either routinely used, or, are being optimised in our lab. However, there is a need to develop in vitro protein assays to characterise the Rd-Cav interaction before conducting cell-based assays. We currently lack the expertise and infrastructure to to produce the large quantities of protein necessary and so are collaborating with our industrial partners at AZ/Medi. 
We are subcloning our constructs into AZ vectors for protein expression and will go to AZ to assist in large-scale protein purfication.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Manchester</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Faculty of Medical and Human Sciences</gtr:department><gtr:description>Calcium channelopathies and cardiac sudden death</gtr:description><gtr:id>A009632A-0085-40E4-ABFC-2464287E7512</gtr:id><gtr:impact>See comments above. We have preliminary data showing the effects on calcium channel function of known mutations in the alpah2delta subunits. This has highlighted a novel functional role for this region of alpha2delta. These data are being incorporated into a publication in preparation and will form the basis for a forthcoming grant application to the BHF (early 2015). This information is not only relevant to understanding of cardiac dysfunction but also highlights a novel modus operandi for the alpah2delta protein which in time is likely to have signicant implications for its exploitation as a therapeutic target. The alpha2delta is a key regulator of cellular excitablity and as such has wide therapeutic potential, including treatment for cardiac arrhythmias, neuropathic pain, epilepsy.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5463775119e602.22008174-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>My colleague in FMHS is a clinical research fellow and consultant cardiologist. In addition to his clinical expertise his research background is in cardiac physiology, with a focus on using isolated isolated heart cells in culture to study calcium signalling in cardiac function. As a clinician, he has direct links with the Manchester hospitals and has access to patients presenting with calcium channel mutations. He has links with geneticists involved in the genetic screening of patients and as a result of our collaboration, patients are now being screened for mutations in calcium channel accessory proteins, including alpha2delta, rather than just the pore-forming subunits.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We are working with colleagues in FMHS (University of Manchester) to characterise the effects of calcium channel mutations associated with cardiac arrythmias &amp;amp; sudden death. Out expertise is in the use of recombinant channel proteins which can be genetically engineered and expressed in mammalian cell systems to characterise the effects on channel function (gating, cellular localisation etc) using electrophysiology, biochemistry and imaging techniques. Initial work has focused on mutations in the alpha2delta subunit of Ca channels. This preliminary work has shed light on the functional consequences of mutations in this channel subunit in terms of cardiac function but also has had a direct impact on my lab's work on alpha2delta structure-function. The mutations in cardiac alpha2delta which are associated with cardiac dysfunction are in regions of the protein for which there has previously been no known function. This information, combined with our previous findings and recent work reported in another lab has provided evidence for a novel modus operandi for alpha2delta. Our aim is to apply for BHF funding in the new year, in order to continue this work.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Manchester</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Faculty of Life Sciences</gtr:department><gtr:description>Role of caclium channel alpha2delta-3 subunit in Drosophilia</gtr:description><gtr:id>1DC16905-B6D3-4AFC-8572-1C0102FA275E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Previously our work has been restricted to studying the role of alpha2delta subunits within a cellular context. The use of Drosophila enables us to study the role of alpha2delta at the whole organism level. 

Preliminary data indicate that knockout of alpha2delta-3 (Straightjacket), suggested to be important for synaptogenesis, causes significant disruption of diurnal rhythm in flies. This provides the first evidence for regulation of behavioural effects via alpha2delta subunits. 

Having thus established Drosophila as an appropriate model system, we now propose to examine how alpha2delta mediates these effects by using a multidisciplinary approach:

1. Molecular Biology - generation of mutant alpha2delta subunits
2. Genetically engineer flies to express mutant alpha2delta subunits
2. Behavioural studies to determine effects of mutations on diurnal rhythm
3. Imaging - morphological changes in neuromuscular synapses
4. Electrophysiology - at fly NMJ and in heterologous expression systems, e.g. COS-7 cells.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>eAw98yN9Sip-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>To date all our work has been at the cellular level.
