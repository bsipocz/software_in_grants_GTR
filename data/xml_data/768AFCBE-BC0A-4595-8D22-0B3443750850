It identifies existing governance constraints to such integration and explores how they can be overcome. The study is undertaken in two countries that contain among the most extensive remaining tropical forests in the world, Brazil and Indonesia.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The proposed research addresses the following questions:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>What is the evidence about the main synergies and trade-offs between forest mitigation and adaptation in Brazil and Indonesia?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>How can multi-level policy processes better exploit existing synergies between forest mitigation and adaptation (while recognising existing trade-offs)?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>How can existing political constraints to such integration be overcome and existing opportunities for integration be realised?&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This research contributes to the knowledge on multi-level forest governance as well as on climate change mitigation and adaptation. In examining the governance constraints and opportunities for integration, it aims to inform ongoing global and national policy processes about how to improve effectiveness of policy formulation and implementation.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research aims to impact policy debates, policy processes and the implementation of REDD+ activities. 
A number of different stakeholder groups at different scales will directly benefit from this research:
1. Researchers and practitioners working on REDD+ and ecosystem-based adaptation.
This study will produce new knowledge about the policy constraints to and opportunities for exploiting existing synergies between forest-based climate change mitigation and adaptation at different scales. It will contribute to reframe academic debates on forest governance by including local adaptation concerns in the REDD+ governance literature. In doing so, it will also contribute a new multi-level analytical approach to forest governance. In addition, the empirical evidence from the four local cases will inform practitioners working on REDD+ and adaptation projects at the local level about how to better integrate the objectives of forest-based mitigation and forest-based adaptation in Indonesia and Brazil. This will be achieved through participation in conferences and the publications of the findings of the research in high-impact academic journals and two more extensive working papers that explore the application of the results.
2. International negotiators involved in UNFCCC policy processes and government funding agencies (e.g. DFID, NORAD etc.)
The research will inform advisory bodies to the UNFCCC (such as the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice), international negotiators and funding agencies on how to better support the integration of REDD+ and forest-based adaptation in national settings that are engaging in the development and implementation of REDD+ strategies. This will facilitate a more supportive global policy environmental for the integration of mitigation and adaptation and improve the effectiveness of aid used in climate compatible development projects. UNFCCC side-events and international conferences that bring together researchers, international negotiators and development agencies will provide the venues to present, discuss and disseminate the findings of the research. 
3. National policy actors, in particular government agencies and civil society organisations in Brazil and Indonesia
At the national level the research will inform national policy actors about the constraints and opportunities to better integrate policy processes across sectors and scales. A policy workshop in each country will provide the venue to present findings and to discuss ways to improve such integration with a variety of national and sub-national level agencies working on REDD+ and forest-based adaptation, environmental and development NGOs and producer organizations that are engaging in REDD+ schemes. The workshop will provide a forum where policy actors working on REDD+ and adaptation can explore these synergies and apply research findings to improve the effectiveness of national REDD+ strategies and future REDD+ activities and schemes.
4. Local authorities, local NGOs in the 4 municipalities/districts where the local fieldwork. 
At the local level the study will benefits the work of local authorities and NGOs involved in supporting REDD+ and forest-based adaptation projects. These actors will be addressed through interviews and an interactive workshop. Local workshops will provide the venue for these actors to reflect on the research findings from the study, on existing synergies and obstacles they have observed and how to better integrate REDD+ and local adaptation projects. In particular the workshop will provide an important opportunity for civil society organisations to access state actors and contribute to shaping more effective, inclusive and equitable policies. In the final instance, the research will indirectly benefit local communities living in the forest margins, as it will inform future REDD+ schemes on how to account for and enhance local forest-based adaptation outcomes.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-12-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>249100</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Federal University of Rio de Janeiro</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Brazil, Federative Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Research Collaboration in relation the ESRC Grant</gtr:description><gtr:id>2D16C730-DB7C-4477-8CBB-1374F045C274</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Di Gregorio, M., Fatorelli, L., Pramova, E., May, P., Locatelli, B. &amp;amp; Brockhaus, M., 2016.

The project has created new opportunities to debate, learn and exchange innovative ideas that support the design and implementation of more effective climate and development policies in the land use sector. Awareness was raised about the importance of reconciling climate mitigation, adaptation and development objectives, including highlighting the importance of addressing existing and potential trade-offs between them. One example refers to the realization of policymakers working in one of three areas - climate mitigation or climate adaptation or development - of how a specific policy decision might impact the other two objectives, and the subsequent need to consider such interactions when decisions among policy alternative are made. Another example refers to policy makers becoming advocates of joint policy approaches to mitigation and adaptation in the land use sector and referring to research produced by partners collaborating in the project to support their statements. Engagement has occurred in particular with ongoing policy developments related to climate change policies in the land use sector through international face to face meetings, presentations, research publications and policy workshops.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>F0A57DAA-4835-43D2-A57C-DD74862F6732</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56e04aa6118df1.97162132</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The key findings of this research project relate to three main domains. First, they refer to whether mitigation or adaptation is considered a key policy priority in the land use sector. Second, they pertain to the extent to which policies effectively integrate distinct climate change and development objectives. And third, they refer to the main challenges linked to multi-level governance processes. 

Mitigation and adaptation focus and priority:
In both Brazil and Indonesia there is a much stronger policy focus on climate change mitigation compared to adaptation in the land use sector. Much more resources, policy initiatives, expertise and skills are found in the mitigation domain, and there is a clear - at times recognised - need to increase capacity on climate change adaptation at all governance levels. Such discrepancy also hampers the realisation of joint approaches to mitigation, adaptation and development. In terms of differences between agricultural and forestry sectors, in the former climate change impacts and the importance of adaptation are somewhat recognised, but are completed neglected in the latter.

Climate Policy Integration:
Climate Policy Integration in the land use sector requires not just mainstreaming climate change into development policies, but also reconciling climate change mitigation and adaptation goals. Yet, little attention is given to such integration in national policy processes.
In particular, the findings indicate that more attention needs to be given to address possible trade-offs between climate change mitigation and development objectives. And finally, more knowledge and capacity on climate change adaptation is required in order to support more effective climate policy integration.

Multi-level Governance Challenges: 
In both Indonesia and Brazil the project found that there are major obstacles to collaboration and communication across governance levels. In fact, working at different governance levels (national, sub-national) results in distinct understanding (discourses) and priority setting with regards to climate change mitigation, adaptation and development objectives. In addition, dominant policy coalitions at the national level, led by state actors, treat climate change mitigation and adaptation as separate domains. As a consequence, limited attention is given to opportunities for integrated policy action. It is local policy actors and national level domestic NGOs that make most efforts to reach across levels of governance. They also tend to have a more integrated view of climate and development problems compared to central state actors, but again capacity at local level on climate change issues remains limited overall.

Further research questions: 
This study has focused primarily on understanding multi-level policy processes around the design and integration of climate change mitigation and adaptation policies in the land use sector. Thanks to this research, today we have better knowledge about what facilitates or hampers integrated policy design. There is, however, a need to investigate further policy implementation processes and the particular challenges that are linked to translating climate policies into effective integrated practices in the land use sector. This study has focused primarily on multi-level processes between national and sub-national levels of governance, and there is scope to further explore linkages and mutual influences between national and supra-national processes.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>It is envisioned that scholars working on climate policy integration, climate and development and forestry and agriculture in the Global South will build on the conceptual framework of the research project. This will lead to more attention and research on obstacles and opportunities to internal climate policy integration as well as on investigating further how to overcome multi-level challenges to policy design and implementation around climate compatible development.
International climate change policy processes can also draw on the findings of this study to support the operationalization of joint mitigation and adaptation actions, which are recognised in the Climate Paris Agreement and under the Green Climate Fund as a priority area for implementation of climate policy. 
National and sub-national policies actors in Indonesia and Brazil, many of which participated in the research and have debated the project findings with academics and practioners, are envisioned to better recognise opportunities for future policy integration and facilitation of cross-level linkages between governance levels. The findings about the lack of knowledge, skills and resources available for climate change adaptation should provide a wake-up call to national governments and the international community about what it needed to better prepare the Global South for climate change impacts.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C1937EE6-EECD-4DA3-BA23-56ACD3F5E0BF</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e060714990b5.45806623</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.see.leeds.ac.uk/research/sri/research/environment-and-development-research-group/research-projects/multi-level-governance-redd-and-synergies-between-climate-change-mitigation-and-adaptation/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>This database contains survey data related to interviewed organizations involved in climate change and land use policy network processes from Indonesia and Brazil at different levels of governance, about the understanding, perceptions and priorities regarding climate change mitigation and adaptation in the land use sector, and networking data about communication and collaboration among policy actors.</gtr:description><gtr:id>3103A454-BF30-40E4-BD72-68D9AC2F9349</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The data will be posted at the end of reporting period in the ESRC Depository and will be publicly available thereafter</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c8216fe2b234.27599064</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Synergies survey outputs</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3129DB0E-E425-4B5E-A45D-78AB36B89CAD</gtr:id><gtr:title>Integrating climate change mitigation and adaptation in agriculture and forestry: opportunities and trade-offs</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Climate Change</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/1606a6172bddd4ce726cbe4716a78be7"><gtr:id>1606a6172bddd4ce726cbe4716a78be7</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Locatelli B</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56e030c3e02959.33551903</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3BF348BF-317B-4D67-918A-7C6AC99F6ECF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Climate policy integration in the land use sector: Mitigation, adaptation and sustainable development linkages</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Environmental Science &amp;
