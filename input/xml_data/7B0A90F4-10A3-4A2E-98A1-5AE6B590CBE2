One reason for this is that the reliability of electrical insulation systems, also found on our rail infrastructure, has proved extremely high. However much of the existing infrastructure is now very old, well beyond its design life. In addition, radical changes are now being implemented in power systems. These are largely driven by the desire to facilitate renewable (low carbon) energy supplies. Moreover as electricity replaces gas for heating homes, and electric vehicles replace petrol and diesel powered cars, more electricity will be consumed requiring greater densities of power transmission, particularly into our cities. These requirements necessitate higher electrical stresses on insulation and higher temperature ratings, whilst maintaining reliability. For these reasons improving our understanding of the failure mechanisms of insulation and designing improved insulation are both critical to the further development of our power systems. Reliability of insulation systems is also critical in power generation, rail networks and manufacturing industries.

This project will improve our understanding of insulation reliability and develop structured materials with improved performance. In particular a fundamental ageing mechanism in polymeric insulation known as electrical treeing will be studied in detail. Electrical tree growth is a mechanism of long-term failure in polymer insulation systems under high electrical stress and is a process leading to the development of an artefact which resembles a botanical tree. It consists of tubular hollow branches of up to tens of microns in diameter. The presence of a tree eventually leads to insulation failure. 
The project will consider how the use of layered dielectrics can enhance insulation life, particularly in the presence of electrical trees. Recent feasibility work between Prof Rowland (University of Manchester) and Prof Choy (UCL) has shown that thin layers of polymers can change tree propagation times by an order of magnitude. Also novel techniques in Manchester have now enabled three-dimensional imaging of the treeing process to be generated. This has used unique experimental facilities and skills for sample preparation at UCL and the imaging capability at the University of Manchester including the Diamond Light Source X-ray facility. 

Although this work is based on fundamental science, a key component of the project will be take the findings and develop a framework for improved layered dielectric structures. A route for future development of processes and products for the power networks, mass transit and power electronics industries will be developed. The commitment of external partners to generating this framework has been obtained to ensure technology transfer during the project life. Ultimately this work will contribute to better performing, lower cost and more robust electricity supplies.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>468385</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>CAV Aerospace</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Nanocomposite coatings for aviation applications.</gtr:description><gtr:id>A4B2BF07-36E6-46FC-84E1-52E8B935E3A5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Multidisciplinary collaboration which has led to a joint grant application to develop a prototype demonstrator.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c9d9c9beee06.38116288-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Exploitation of nanocomposite coatings by CAV Aerospace for aviation applications.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Materials discovery and innovative and cost-effective manufacturing of high performance nanocomposite coatings by UCL.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Materials Hub Launch Event</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E077022B-1998-46D7-81A2-0C898F3C42CE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The event has led to wider engagements with academic and industry sectors, resulted in new successful joint grant applications to Innovate UK and European Commission.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c9d56d822ff6.75655647</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>2nd International Conference and Expo on Ceramics and Composite Materials Berlin, Germany July 25-26, 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>12296031-7903-4861-947F-E696EB8F247D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The keynote paper was well received which has led to wider collaborations and join grant applications.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c9d7c3e3e465.59210845</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>1000000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>European Union (EU)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>EUR</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>Austria</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>de_AT</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>H2020 Sedna</gtr:description><gtr:end>2020-04-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>European Commission</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>A9A35628-E558-4461-8D66-2163F46BBA6E</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c9c587d65ca2.75063758</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-05-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>49365</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>ENDURANCE</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-02-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Innovate UK</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>1BF78DB0-3205-4218-800B-11F0FD471EE2</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c9dcd77e4396.64455922</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-03-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput><gtr:description>Negotiations and discussion are in progress on new licences and options on our AAID technology with:

The objective of this project is to develop quantified descriptions of how a dielectric's micro-structure impacts tree growth. For the first time it is expected that the interaction between micro-filler/nano-filler and an electrical tree can be established.
Optimum chemical precursor system and processing conditions have successfully been formulated and developed for the deposition of nano-BN filled layered epoxy systems using a controlled fabrication technology based on the novel, cost-effective and non-vacuum Aerosol Assisted Ion Deposition (AAID) method at UCL. The reproducibility of such deposition has been demonstrated.
 These BN/epoxy nanocomposite films were well characterised using a combination of SEM, FTIR and Raman spectroscopy to study the dispersion of nano-sized fillers within the epoxy matrix, surface morphology, structure and filler-polymer matrix interface. Further in-depth characterisation is in progress.
Nanocomposite films with different wt% (e.g. 5 and 10 wt%) of BN nano-filler have also been fabricated using AAID method and supplied to the Manchester's team (led by Prof Rowland in order to establish the mechanism of long-term failure in polymer high voltage insulation systems.
 From the characterisation of tree growth study at Manchester, structures with ~50 &amp;micro;m think layers of nano-composites exhibited tree-retardant properties and significant improvements in performance of preventing high voltage breakdown, where electrical tree branches moving along the surfaces rather than through the structures.
 Further samples with composite films with varying in the size, concentration of nano- and micro fillers and their dispersion, thickness of the layers will be fabricated and characterised at UCL so that these materials properties and filler-matrix interface, dielectric structure, tree morphology and life expectance could be systematically studied and correlated in collaboration with Manchester in order to establish the mechanism of tree growth. This will provide vital information towards the design and development of a framework for improved dielectric material design, by modification of electrode/polymer interface and by development of layered dielectric structures. In addition, in-situ formation of nanocomposites would also be explored. We will develop with the power industry a route for future development of process and products for the power networks, mass transit and power electronics industries to exploit the findings of our project.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We will work closely with our industrial collaborators and technology experts from the power industry to develop a road map for potential exploitation of structured dielectrics as well as the future development of process and products for the power networks, mass transit and power electronics industries to exploit the findings of our project.
