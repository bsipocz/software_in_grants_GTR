Although genetic systems regulate the early part of post natal craniofacial growth, later development is strongly regulated by mechanical loading. The craniofacial skeleton responds to its immediate mechanical environment by passively growing where bones meet (the sutures) in response to the expansion of the soft tissues (e.g. brain, tongue, muscles). It is also resculpted by modelling and remodelling mechanisms that add and remove bone from surfaces, being modulated by the mechanical milieu. It is important we understand these mechanically regulated processes because they are essential not only in normal growth but also when things go wrong. Further we need to know how the features of craniofacial form that characterise and vary between related species come about. Commonly our teeth do not fit well to our mouths, yet in the historical past this was not the case; what has happened? The answer likely lies in the change to softer diets that alter the mechanical loading of the growing face and subsequent growth. More rarely sutures may fuse too early or skull cartilages may not grow adequately because of inherited conditions. The subsequent growth of the skull has to adapt to the altered starting conditions and optimise function. The mechanical signals are key in this. Understanding mechanical regulation should lead to better prediction of normal and altered growth and understanding of which features of the facial skeleton are inherited and which adapted to local mechanics. This is important in resolving arguments about the relationships among fossil and living species. One approach to understanding the mechanical regulation of the growth of the face is to carry out experiments in which animals are operated on to cut muscles, move teeth, excise structures etc and observe the outcomes. This has been a very profitable line of research especially in primates, our nearest relatives but now it is ethically and economically difficult to carry on this work in the UK. Our current best sources of information in these areas come from continuing animal studies outside Europe, especially in the USA. Animal experiments are very useful but they are difficult to properly control and lengthy and time consuming to carry out and interpret. They could be replaced if we had a good computer model of facial, and eventually, skull growth. While such a full model is long way off we plan in this project to emulate the mechanical regulation of facial bone adaptation that will allow prediction of the consequences of altered loading. The work will build on computer models that we have developed over the past three years employing engineering techniques for predicting how loads are distributed (finite elements analysis / FEA). We will apply them to two related old world monkey groups, macaques and mangabeys, with similar faces at birth that develop very different features of adult form. Thus macaques develop air sinuses in the maxilla but mangabeys do not, instead they develop deep excavations of the external aspect of the face, the maxillary fossae. We will extend our models by simulating what we know of how bone adapts so that initial loading is used to drive simulated bone deposition or resorption. We will then carry out a series of experiments with our computer models to test ideas about the development of features of facial form and in so doing work to improve our models and our understanding. In this way we will advance knowledge of how the face grows and develop technologies that will underpin future, more complete models of craniofacial development that will eventually underpin predictions of growth with applicability in biology, medicine and studies of human and primate origins.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>We propose to extend our work on primate craniofacial mechanics to the prediction and simulation of aspects of growth. We will model mechanical regulation of bony development first by attempting to explain the development of characteristic remodelling fields and then of anatomical features of adult form, not present at birth such as bony thickenings (e.g. pillars) and structures (e.g. the sinuses, fossae processes and prominences). We will capitalise on our novel software tool developments, extending and validating these to address these issues. Multibody dynamics analysis (MDA) will be used to estimate the external forces applied by biorealistic muscle models during normal skull loading. Finite elements analysis (FEA) and a unique adaptive FEA approach from earlier work will be validated against experimental data and incorporated into our present software (Vox-FE). This will be used to model the skulls, predicting their response to changing patterns of stress/strain that result from enlargement of the brain and/or sense organs, variations in sutures and jaw muscles, and the developing dentition. These predicted outcomes will be compared with observed features and discrepancies will guide reformulation of our models and the underlying algorithms for adaptive responses. We will extend our knowledge of craniofacial ontogeny in primates and progress towards the eventual goal of a detailed in silico model that will incorporate the passive expansion of sutures, active growth of cartilages, patterning of bony responsiveness to mechanical conditions and systemic and intrinsic biochemical regulation. To support this work we have access to cadaveric and dried skulls, 3D microCT data and to a supercomputer for highly detailed static and adaptive skull remodelling studies. The work will be carried out by a multidisciplinary team working in state of the art engineering, anatomical and computational facilities and building on years of prior experience and development.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>253927</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>A new exhibition opened this year at the Natural History Museum - The human evolution gallery.

We developed sophisticated multibody dynamic models of adult and juvenile macaque and mangabey crania, and used these to simulate biting. Our findings replicated data from published in vivo data in respect of bite forces and muscle activations on working and balancing sides. The results, loading scenarios for bites on each tooth along the dental row, were then applied to FE models. Directly measured surface strains and predicted bite forces were used to validate our modelling. Subsequently the effects of simplifications of modelling (e.g omitting sutures, periodontal ligaments, internal cavities and sinuses) on resulting strains and bite forces were thoroughly investigated using strain maps and the combined FEA/GMM approach. 



This work provided several important new insights into how to build reliable functional models of the skull and how to assess the impact of modelling decisions on functioning. Additionally we have published simulation evidence that supports a novel hypothesis: that the action of masseter on the zygomatic arch is balanced by tension that develops in the temporal fascia during temporalis contraction; bending is largely eliminated. This is potentially a significant advance in craniofacial mechanics that both explains the slenderness of the arch and eliminates the need to postulate differential remodelling thresholds to explain how the zygomatic region tolerates what until now was thought to be very high strains. 



We are confident that these outputs will impact widely, particularly informing model building from CT data and subsequent comparison of deformations. Finally, we have successfully extended our software (VOX-FE) such that adaptive remodelling can be simulated and muscles wrapped. The second component explored linkages between facial loading and morphology. Thus, our investigations have indicated that omission of facial sutures in models has only a local effect on bone strains; it does not serve to reduce strains elsewhere in the face during biting. Additionally, we carried out FEA in subadult and adult macaques comparing cumulative strain maps with SEM derived maps of facial remodelling. There is an approximate match, providing evidence for mechanical modulation of these fields but even more complex models will be needed to tie this down. We were able to complete work on browridge mechanical function during the course of this grant with the finding that the supraorbital



The work of this project has led to several innovative processes and tools: Key is the advance in software for functional simulation which was Objective 3 of the proposal. We significantly developed of our Finite Element Analysis (FEA) software tool VOX-FE. Thus, we developed unique algorithms to automatically wrap muscles, such as temporalis, in Finite Element Models (FEMs) and so greatly improve physiological simulation of cranial loading. This algorithm and proof of method is published. A further advance is the development of a skeletal adaptation algorithm within VOX-FE that simulates bony adaptation to loading. The programmer was employed on this project for 18 months and in retrospect this was not enough. Ideally we would have liked to have thoroughly de-bugged the code and given VOX-FE sufficient polish to release a PC based version to the wider community. We have already sought further funding to achieve this, unsuccessfully, but will continue to apply to complete the development and release VOX-FE. 



A second major advance in process concerns a breakthrough in the rapid production of FEMs and quantitative comparison between loadcases and specimens of the deformations resulting from FEA. This has major implications in that it allows us to carry out FEAs of samples and so address functional variability in a novel and powerful way. Thus, O'Higgins with Phillips, through Marie Curie RTN funding, were responsible for the development of a software toolbox for the analysis and visualisation of variations in form of skeletal systems using the statistical approaches of geometric

morphometrics (The EVAN toolbox; http://www.evan-society.org/). This toolbox allows variability among specimens to be quantified, compared and related to factors of interest such as age (which is directly related to this proposal). Outputs include warped surface models of representative specimens. These models can in turn be rapidly converted to FEA models in VOX-FE, thus reducing model building from days to hours. Potentially, series of such models open up the possibility of assessing how function co-varies with form within (e.g. during growth) and between species. However, this only partially achieves this goal, since warping of models involves altering both external and internal anatomy. The internal anatomy (trabeculae, sinuses, other cavities) arises in the skeleton as a function of loading (adaptation, see below experimental simulation of sinus formation) and optimisation of bone form such that stiffness is maintained in relation to physiological loadings using minimum material. Clearly warped internal features are unlikely to correspond morphologically to what might be expected to arise via adaptation and so loaded warped specimens will not behave correctly under load. 

Our recent experiments have shown that solid models, with no internal cavities largely circumvent this. Under physiological loads, the cranium behaves very similarly to the full model with cavities. Thus by warping solid models good approximations of true patterns of deformation are achieved. One further step is required to complete this novel approach; we need to be able to quantitatively compare deformations between models and load cases. Again the EVAN toolbox combines with VOX-FE to offer a solution. Geometric morphometrics is concerned with quantification and comparison of variations in form using landmark data. O'Higgins developed with Oxnard, theoretical underpinnings of landmarking as applied to FEA (publications). We then applied landmarking and GMM to FEA models before and after loading and manipulation. The result is an approach that opens up the possibility of novel and highly informative comparative functional analyses. We have published the first papers applying GMM/FEA in the last year. We believe this is a methodological paradigm shift that will lead to completely new understandings of form and function.



A significant outcome of this work is that replacement of animals in studies of masticatory system (and so, other musculoskeletal systems) is now much closer to reality. Once the model is validated, animals are not required in . Indeed the sophisticated modelling approaches we have advanced offer the prospect of carrying out experiments that are far better controlled and which address a broader range of issues than could be achieved using animals. As we gain experience in building and validating models we will develop greater knowledge of how to build them and so increase confidence. Eventually, this will inevitably reduce even further the need for animals.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>A long term target is to bring these methods to humans and apply them in relation to craniofacial anomalies and their treatment.
