However, linguists have long observed that, beneath this surface diversity, all human languages share a number of fundamental structural similarities. Most obviously, all languages use sounds, all languages have words, and all languages have a grammar. More subtly and more surprisingly, similarities can also be observed in more fine-grained linguistic features: for instance, George Zipf famously observed that, across multiple languages, short words tend also to be more frequent, and in my own recent work I have shown that languages prefer to use words that sound alike (e.g., cat, mat, rat, bat, fat, ...). Why do all languages exhibit these shared features? 

This project aims to tackle exactly this key question by studying how languages are shaped by the human mind. In particular, I will explore how the way we learn language and use it to communicate drives the emergence of important features of lexicons, the set of all words in a language. To simulate the process of language change and evolution in the lab, I will use an experimental paradigm where an artificial language is passed between learners (language learning), and used by individuals to communicate with each other (language use). This paradigm has been successfully applied in previous research showing that key structural features of language can be explained as a consequence of repeated learning and use; my contribution will be to apply the same methods to study the evolution of the lexicon. I will then use two complementary techniques to evaluate the ecological validity of these results. First, do the artificial lexicons obtained after repeated learning and communication match the structure of lexicons found in real human languages? We will assess this by analyzing real natural language corpora using computational methods. Second, are these lexicons easily learnable by young children, the primary conduit of natural language transmission in the wild? This will be assessed using methods from developmental psychology to study word learning in toddlers.

The present project requires an unprecedented integration of techniques and concepts from language evolution, computational linguistics and developmental psychology, three fields that have so far worked independently to understand the structure of language. The outcomes of the project will be of vital interest for all these communities, and will provide insights into the foundational properties found in all human languages, as well as the nature of the constraints underlying language processing and language acquisition. This project will provide a springboard for my future work at the intersection of computational and experimental approaches to language and cognitive development.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research?
Language is an integral part of our daily life, it is present everywhere in the world and children seem to acquire it without any effort. In the present context of globalization, questions about language are given a special importance: People's awareness of language diversity is increasing and there is a growing concern regarding language learning, in children as well as in adults. This booming interest in languages is also shared by IT companies, who invest considerably in natural language processing techniques to select, translate and make information globally available. Research on language is thus, in the current context, a natural entry point for public engagement in science and may have broader engineering applications. Accordingly, the principal beneficiaries of this project (outside academia) will be the general public, the media, parents, childcare practitioners and IT companies.

1) Impact on the broader public and the media
The proposed research deals with the relationship between language structure and the human mind. It speaks to questions that captivate the general public and the media such as: What is the origin of language? Why do languages change? Does language define us as humans? This provides an opportunity to raise public engagement with language research by communicating the current state-of-the-art results about language and its interaction with the human mind. It also provides the opportunity to educate the public on the scientific approach and the methods used to establish such results.

2) Impact on parents and childcare practitioners
The outcomes of the present project will shed light on what makes certain words easier to learn than others (because of properties such as their length, their frequency or their sound similarity to other words). These results and the methods used to study these questions should be of interest for parents and childcare practitioners who daily witness the progress and the difficulties of young children learning language.

3) Impact on IT companies
One of the objectives of the proposed project is to study how wordform similarity evolves to allow lexicons to become more robust to environmental noise. This result could have broader engineering applications. For instance, whenever one types a non-word on Google, Google's &amp;quot;did you mean&amp;quot; feature will typically propose an orthographically related word instead. Their algorithm presumably uses a complex noise model, which may be improved by formalizing how new words form and what we should expect their phonetic characteristics to be in relation to existing words in the lexicon. In general, aspects of human cognition (such as functional constraints associated with language learning and language use) are rarely taken into account when designing machine learning applications and could offer promising improvement of these applications.

How will they benefit from this research?
1) Through interactive outreach events to be held in science festivals
2) Through active participation in the present project: participating children's families will discover how researchers can measure word learning even though their 20-month-old children have only a few words in their productive vocabulary.
3) Through public lectures and media coverage. 
4) Through the internet, by making short and accessible study reports and instructional videos on language learning and language evolution.
5) Through conferences that bring together IT companies and researchers.

Impact outcome
To evaluate the impact outcomes, I will count the number of attendance during public lectures and events, count the number of visits on the lab's website as well as the number of downloads of the reports, monitor the number of views of the instructional videos and evaluate the increase of participation in the project after each media coverage.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>162197</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7969DEC7-1C71-4020-B7A7-21F5E02BC596</gtr:id><gtr:title>Phrasal prosody constrains syntactic analysis in toddlers.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Cognition</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5959dc911c7ad83e6e7f2a3ba7da1ae4"><gtr:id>5959dc911c7ad83e6e7f2a3ba7da1ae4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>de Carvalho A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0010-0277</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a86b8ab936ed9.95503043</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B1581C5C-A2A2-441B-946D-0316E68C1308</gtr:id><gtr:title>Words cluster phonetically beyond phonotactic regularities.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Cognition</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ef3cc24f9068291ee8d189f6c1ad4c05"><gtr:id>ef3cc24f9068291ee8d189f6c1ad4c05</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dautriche I</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0010-0277</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a86b8abc6b358.82972701</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>89CDE126-12AC-4978-B7F1-0649D3B43401</gtr:id><gtr:title>Wordform Similarity Increases With Semantic Similarity: An Analysis of 100 Languages.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Cognitive science</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ef3cc24f9068291ee8d189f6c1ad4c05"><gtr:id>ef3cc24f9068291ee8d189f6c1ad4c05</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dautriche I</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0364-0213</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a86b8ab5f3329.95934343</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N017404/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>B94A2498-60DA-4055-A957-686B6CB42654</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Linguistics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E3D10FCE-1658-4591-88D0-80A32BF192D0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Computational Linguistics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9A6079E0-357B-44DA-80F9-C5953586BD0C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Developmental psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4685997F-6C82-4108-9425-1593E206E9F2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Language Acquisition</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>670B21EC-383C-4A51-856D-14A82FAE3EC0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Language Variation &amp; Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>28710E94-8B47-404A-BD40-7BCB8C709774</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Linguistics (General)</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
