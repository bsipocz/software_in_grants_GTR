The disease has no easily recognisable symptom and often starts to develop in early
childhood. Without receiving timely treatment, it leads to a life-time visual impairment.
Hence, there is a significant demand in constant monitoring the vision of children for early
detection and timely treatment.
Under the support from a previously TSB-funded project, we have conducted a feasibility
study for treating amblyopia with stereoscopic technologies and developed a technical
framework for building an Amblyopia Patient Care Suite, which is designed to contain a
series of games to allow for the detection and treatment of the disease on mobile devices. This
offers an interesting approach to detect and treat amblyopia for children, as the use of 3D
stereoscopic mobile games can significantly increase their level of concentration and
cooperation during the treatment. It also allows training of the coordination between both
eyes, significantly reducing the risk of over-penalising the good eye that lies in the traditional
treatment method.
While encouraging outcomes have been achieved in the initial trials, in-depth investigations
are still needed for a solid plan that bridges the research to the market. To this end, this
proposed proof of market study is a timely effort in identifying targeted user groups and their
requirement, in performing market and competitor analysis, allowing estimation on further
development cost and prediction of business growth.
The study will be conducted using both primary and secondary research methods. The
primary research will involve potential customers by organising interviews, online survey and
focus groups. The secondary research will explore published information such as market
reports.
The work is expected to further strengthen the business partnership with the UK?s leading eye
care centre ? the Moorfields Eye Hospital</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>24960</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">700230</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
