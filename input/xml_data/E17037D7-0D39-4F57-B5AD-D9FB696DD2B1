These have been used in different modern communication standards, thus indicating that information theory provides the most appropriate approach to design communication systems. However, it still faces many challenges, notably its possible application to different fields, such as biology, machine learning or complexity theory.

Arguably one of the recent great developments in the field is network coding, a revolutionary technique to transmit data through a network. Unlike routing, network coding lets the intermediate nodes combine the messages they receive, thus achieving a higher throughput. While routing treats information like an ordinary commodity, network coding transmits data by taking full advantage of the specific nature of information. As such, it can dramatically outperform routing in terms of throughput, robustness to network topology changes and packet losses. Network coding has attracted a large amount of research and has inspired other applications such as distributed storage and content distribution. 

Memoryless computation is a new paradigm for computing functions, which offers two main innovations. First, it computes functions in a radically novel way. Unlike traditional computing, which views the registers as &amp;quot;black boxes,&amp;quot; memoryless computation takes advantage of the nature of the information contained in those registers and combines the values of the different registers. Thus, it can be seen as the analogue of network coding for computing. The second innovation lies in the computational model, which offers to use any possible update of a register, without communicating with the memory. This model aims at emulating computations as they are carried out in a core, for they mostly involve manipulations of registers. An update is viewed as a quantum of complexity, hence the complexity measure is the number of updates required to compute a function, regardless of how complex each update could be.

Memoryless computation offers several advantages over traditional computing in theory. First, it offers a computational speed-up at the core level: for some classes of functions, we can obtain arbitrarily shorter programs than the traditional approach. Secondly, memoryless computation does not rely on additional buffers and hence performs computations in line. Memory management is a tedious task which can significantly slow down computations; this is particularly important for parallel architectures with shared memory. Although this problem can be alleviated by using different levels of cache, it still uses more hardware and brings a significant overhead. Memoryless computation offers a radical alternative: it uses no memory at all. It thus eases concurrent execution of different tasks by preventing memory conflicts. It also optimises the use of a crucial and expensive resource and offers another speed-up by avoiding any communication with the data memory.

Therefore, memoryless computation is an innovative approach to computing, with high potential to speed up computationally expensive problems and applications including multicore architectures and parallel computing. The long term objective of research in memoryless computation is to determine where it could be advantageous over traditional means of computing and to build hardware which could fully benefit from those principles. The proposed research is fundamental work which will lay the necessary foundations for a possible future implementation of memoryless computation ideas. In particular, we aim at evaluating the computational speed-up offered by memoryless computation, designing efficient instruction sets and extending the existing framework to take parallel threads into account.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research is a fundamental work for a dawning area. As such, it will have long term repercussions on many different areas, thus contributing to the UK's competitiveness. Although it is not yet possible to pinpoint exactly what the impact will be on the public audience, two main streams seem to emerge.

Memoryless computation can offer a significant computational speed-up and can facilitate the concurrent running of different tasks on a computer. It is a novel and ambitious redefinition of how to perform computations to suit it to modern computers. Therefore, high performance computing using multi-core architectures or graphical processing units may benefit from it. In turn, in the long run, the numerous scientific fields depending on computing power will be affected by the improvements offered by memoryless computation.

Network coding has an incredible potential, and in theory dramatically outperforms routing. This research will yield results on how to implement easy schemes for network coding, making it easier to implement. This contributes to the main problem of making computer networks faster, thus allowing to transmit and store an increasing amount of data. This is clearly far reaching, as we are more reliant on online technology every day.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-02-17</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>96437</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>11750</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Royal Society International Exchanges Scheme</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-12-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>The Royal Society</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>14D58BF4-693F-4EA9-87AD-39D9274B87D5</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e00bb8276f64.36972599</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>In this grant, me and my team have developed the study of memoryless computation and its relation to algebra and to other models of computation. Simply put, memoryless computation is a model for computing functions of variables, which does not require the use of extra (temporary, buffer) variables. Its study is fundamentally algebraic, and as such the project team has been involved in developing the relevant branches of algebra for the study of memoryless computation. Moreover, we have tied memoryless computation to distributed models of computation, namely automata networks and cellular automata.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>From a theoretical point of view, we have demonstrated that there is a wealth of related models of computation (e.g. memoryless computation, cellular automata, automata networks) which can be studied using algebraic methods, notably semigroups. The study of computation using semigroups is a very important topic which should be developed.
From a practical point of view, we have developed the model of memoryless computation, thereby showing that it is an interesting model for computation on a core. Further investigation is required to understand how to use memoryless computation efficiently in practice.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>F5600E73-647B-4FFD-8E42-B18362D30847</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e006d383b0e5.73623456</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Electronics</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>044C394F-7C4B-4B84-8C94-49F3413E011A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Entropy of Closure Operators and Network Coding Solvability</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Entropy</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/bd8ded1866b1161866f5f0c0db4810fe"><gtr:id>bd8ded1866b1161866f5f0c0db4810fe</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gadouleau M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>54623bdc12bad9.09000711</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>DF5A5D1E-499E-4465-AA79-D121E22E0150</gtr:id><gtr:title>Ranks of finite semigroups of one-dimensional cellular automata</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Semigroup Forum</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/37ecef467249a308b1923228e0a03e16"><gtr:id>37ecef467249a308b1923228e0a03e16</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Castillo-Ramirez A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56e00af72ab981.29273046</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>CB30CFE9-0B02-499E-9777-8E5E370A2129</gtr:id><gtr:title>Lengths of words in transformation semigroups generated by digraphs</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Algebraic Combinatorics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a558fe190a1cc84bffda6e6ae509b966"><gtr:id>a558fe190a1cc84bffda6e6ae509b966</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cameron P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a2feb6861c6d5.71163013</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>CADAA0FB-EF67-4772-BAA3-9700DA9F39C5</gtr:id><gtr:title>On the possible values of the entropy of undirected graphs</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Graph Theory</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/bd8ded1866b1161866f5f0c0db4810fe"><gtr:id>bd8ded1866b1161866f5f0c0db4810fe</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gadouleau M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fec105dfa80.59516817</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>063A7DE3-E9A4-4EE3-90AD-BBBE5ED8B0CB</gtr:id><gtr:title>Cellular automata and finite groups</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Natural Computing</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/37ecef467249a308b1923228e0a03e16"><gtr:id>37ecef467249a308b1923228e0a03e16</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Castillo-Ramirez A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fe8a4a25707.98450191</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/K033956/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
