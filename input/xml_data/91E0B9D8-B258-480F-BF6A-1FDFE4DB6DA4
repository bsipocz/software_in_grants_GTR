&lt;p>This research focuses on a number of pivotal individuals whose identities are negotiated and consolidated through Church structures on a daily basis in order to show how gender, parenthood and one's working life is weaved in the Church&lt;br />context. These four groups are priests who are mothers, priests who are fathers, non-ordained spouses of women priests, and non-ordained spouses of male priests.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The research aims to empirically and theoretically enhance current research through focusing attention on how different subject positions experience the Church in terms of parenthood and gender roles and the extent to which sacred structures&lt;br />and traditionalism impact on this.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The aim is to create a more comprehensive insight into how gender and parenthood interact in the context of the Church, offering a fresh perspective on the contemporary clergy family, and drawing on a feminist methodology utilising interview data.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-01-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>77775</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Queen's Foundation</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Faith Lives of Women and Girls Symposium</gtr:department><gtr:description>Symposium on the Faith Lives of Women and Girls</gtr:description><gtr:id>4AB34D26-61B3-41B5-AE47-C3B9FFF51E71</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Page, S.

However, it was not until the Church voted to allow women's ordination to the priesthood in 1992 that the gender landscape started to change, with the inclusion of men as clergy spouses. Very little research has documented how men experience life as a clergy spouse. At the same time, women's relationship to the traditional clergy spouse role has come under enormous pressure, with women's greater occupational participation. This paper will focus on female and male clergy spouses, considering what part, if any, spouses play in church life and whether gender differences can be ascertained. The data is based on twenty-five in-depth interviews with spouses across England and the paper will illuminate whether men and women derive any sense of identity from being a 'clergy spouse', whether becoming a clergy spouse affects their faith life, and whether any expectations are put on spouses to perform the role in a particular way.

This paper was delivered to a mixed audience of priests and academics (unfortunately there was no box to select that the primary audience here was not my research participants directly, but it was the 'user group' (women priests) that I had researched; the event took place at a training centre for priests). Therefore, the impact was a raising awareness of the research among a group of people who could identify with the research directly, and also generated interest from priests wanting to do sabbatical-type projects of their own on this subject.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-3925694901.426972b05e6da</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academic audiences (collaborators, peers etc.)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2011</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Clergy mothers in the Church of England</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AAB328E1-F746-433D-BF0F-5B6BA6CD94CA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This paper, based on recent doctoral research investigating priests who are mothers within the Church of England, will examine the processes of inclusion and exclusion in the sacredly masculine organisation. Based on interviews with priests aged between 31 and 54, a vast range of Church experience was captured, incorporating women who were curates, parish priests and those in senior roles at the diocesan level. Consideration will be given to issues such as women's ongoing experiences within the parish context as well as their experiences of senior posts, with a specific focus on how mothers negotiate the Church as an organisation. A fresh insight is thus offered into existing perspectives and understandings. Indeed, pertinent to this discussion will be women's experiences of maternity leave and how they are incorporated into the structures of the Church when they become a mother. It will emphasise that priests who are also mothers are marginalised vis-&amp;agrave;-vis other priests, with discrimination arising from their status as mothers to dependent children. Already a numerical minority within women's leadership, many structural factors impact on devaluing their role, thus making it more difficult for them to participate. Interestingly, women are not encountering one overarching Church culture, but many fractured positions, highlighting the different oppositional mechanisms in place.

There have been a number of significant achievements:
(1)The networking opportunities amassed have been enormous; the Award has allowed me to develop networks with academics both in the UK and the USA, as well as enabling me to cultivate contacts with user groups, particularly clergy and spouses. This was specifically aided with Durham's location as a centre for ministry training. These networking opportunities have meant that my work is much better-known, both amongst academics and non-academics, and I have been asked to contribute to a number of things in light of this awareness, e.g. undertaking one of the keynote lectures at a specialist event on clergy motherhood at Ripon College, Cuddesdon, at which there were many clergy mothers in attendance.
(2) The consolidation of writing outputs has been significant; the Award gave me the space to concentrate on writing outputs and extended reading on the themes of the research, resulting in publication in high-quality journals such as Gender, Work and Organization and Travail, Genre et Soci&amp;eacute;t&amp;eacute;s. The latter publication also allowed my work to be better-known in the French-speaking context. 
(3) This Award enabled new knowledge to be presented in new academic spaces, such as gender and feminist research networks, where religion can often be ignored. As well as the aforementioned publications in journals that do not routinely focus on religion, I have also participated in events such as the Feminist and Women's Studies Association Bi-Annual Conference: Futures of Feminism; what is exciting is that more feminist and gender-specialist spaces are starting to incorporate religion, with for example the Motherhood in post-1968 European Literature Network holding a one-day event in 2013 entitled Motherhood, Religions and Spirituality, and at which I was a respondent. 
(4) As a professional development award, a key aim of the ESRC Postdoctoral Fellowship was in enhancing employability, and after this Award I went on to secure a full-time, permanent lectureship in sociology at Aston University, Birmingham.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>There is increasing capacity of research looking at clergy motherhood, especially from priests themselves undertaking postgraduate study. My attendance at various events where priests undertaking research are in attendance (e.g. the Faith Lives of Women and Girls Symposium, held annually at the Queen's Foundation, Birmingham) confirms that my work is routinely consulted in such projects. This emphasises the ways in which user groups themselves are taking this research topic forward, particularly the development of the theological dimensions to clergy motherhood. So my research considering the specifically sociological elements of clergy motherhood are utilised to complement studying the topic from a theological angle.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5A3CDB87-A02C-4D53-9600-9E19B5F1567C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5461dd9cb2f436.58144176</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>EBC390F7-C7B0-417D-93D8-F8D131AFDC3E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Angels on Earth: Mothering, Religion, and Spirituality</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d3d99cd739a7691258b962d199969ed4"><gtr:id>d3d99cd739a7691258b962d199969ed4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Page, S.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-77258-022-8</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>58be882fa0b596.33073880</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>ED79465A-AA49-4CC1-8159-2AEF4F87E151</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Scrutinized Priest: Women in the Church of England Negotiating Professional and Sacred Clothing Regimes</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Gender, Work &amp; Organization</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/00548bc0049dddc5956f642617099982"><gtr:id>00548bc0049dddc5956f642617099982</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Page S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>541fe2e91bb288.40248345</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>98D42B6D-0F30-4AF0-84C4-30F24CCAE078</gtr:id><gtr:title>Altruism and Sacrifice: Anglican Priests Managing 'Intensive' Priesthood and Motherhood</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Religion and Gender</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/00548bc0049dddc5956f642617099982"><gtr:id>00548bc0049dddc5956f642617099982</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Page S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58be88f74d64f5.85066967</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9A5B8AFA-CCDB-4F42-BC53-E35007BC54FD</gtr:id><gtr:title>negotiating sacred roles: a sociological exploration of priests who are mothers</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Feminist Review</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/00548bc0049dddc5956f642617099982"><gtr:id>00548bc0049dddc5956f642617099982</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Page S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cf97f97837da0e</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7A213B5E-1767-4A6A-8A39-A4B7350E89B1</gtr:id><gtr:title>Femmes, m&amp;egrave;res et pr&amp;ecirc;tres dans l'&amp;Eacute;glise d'Angleterre.
