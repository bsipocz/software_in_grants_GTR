Networks are fundamental to our modern world: they appear throughout science and society, and continue to grow in size, complexity and importance. Whenever we observe entities and relationships between them, we effectively define a network of some sort. As structural objects composed of nodes and links, networks play a strong and well defined role across mathematics, science and engineering. As statistical objects made up of collections of measurements, however, network datasets require significant advances to be made in mathematical knowledge if we are to achieve fundamental understanding.

The crux of the problem, and the essence of the approach to be undertaken in this research, lies in finding the right balance between complexity and parsimony. Currently, the network models that we understand fully from a mathematical viewpoint are too simple to accurately describe modern data. At the same time, models sufficiently rich to provide accurate descriptions are presently beyond our mathematical comprehension, meaning that we cannot use them to draw sound and repeatable conclusions from data. This fundamental lack of understanding slows scientific progress and affects every single economic, social or other policy decision that relies on the analysis of network data.

The main objectives of this research are therefore twofold: first, to develop the new statistical theory needed to view and interpret networks properly as data objects; and second, to transform this theory into new statistical methods that will allow us to model and draw inferences from network data in the real world. These objectives reflect the fact that network modelling and inference is an area of significant national importance. It spans the many diverse fields and contexts where inferences must be drawn and substantiated based on measurements of entities and the relationships or interactions between them.

As networks grow in size and complexity, our ability to analyse them using modern statistical methods is at severe risk of failing to keep pace. Recent theoretical breakthroughs by the fellowship applicant have provided initial headway towards answering longstanding open questions in this area, creating an immediate and direct opportunity to close the fundamental and growing gap between our need to understand network data and our ability to do so. Doing so will provide the UK with a unique capability to lead research developments at the international forefront of this area.

This research will deliver a core set of statistical fundamentals that provide both the strong theoretical underpinnings and the practical tools required to revolutionise network modelling and inference. The work will be carried out in the Department of Statistical Science, University College London, and will involve collaborations with subject matter experts drawn both from within the University and from across the academic community and industry partners.

The methods developed will be applied to a range of important practical problems, so that they may be assessed, refined and improved while under development. This will provide a direct pathway to impact and establish a tight coupling between the mathematical advancements to be achieved and the important practical problems that these advancements will benefit. It will also open up new mathematical connections with other disciplines where networks play a key role, such as the life sciences, and lead directly to new techniques that impact research users across a range of important practical applications that directly affect the health, security and economic competitiveness of the UK populace.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research will benefit a number of constituencies, with academic impact ranging from the mathematics and statistics communities through to a broad range of scientific disciplines, including the social, economic, political, physical, and life sciences, and with economic and societal impact spanning the public and private sectors. End users and other stakeholders, including the public, will also benefit through direct engagement as planned for in the fellowship pathways to impact.

These constituencies will benefit from this research both directly and indirectly, and over both the shorter and longer terms. New mathematical knowledge in network modelling and inference will be developed over the short term, and highly skilled researchers will also be trained in these areas. Key emerging industries focused on large-scale data analysis will benefit directly from the algorithms and inference procedures that will be developed for analysing large, complex networks. This mathematical and practical knowledge will in turn positively impact both the process of scientific discovery and the development of next-generation analytical tools over the medium and longer terms, by helping to maintain the health of other research disciplines that rely on scientific conclusions stemming from the statistical analysis of network data. Similarly, this research will also positively impact decision-making in important policy areas such as security, economics, and global development, by yielding tools to understand collective societal behaviour through the analysis of network datasets, and the mathematical underpinnings to ensure that evidence-based policy decisions can be based on these analyses.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-07-17</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1158173</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Michigan</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:department>Michigan Institute for Data Science</gtr:department><gtr:description>MIDAS</gtr:description><gtr:id>3E34C7F8-0F21-4CB4-9251-82147B1181E5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>MoU signed between UCL and Michigan

The contribution, through an EPSRC Impact Acceleration Award to UCL (IAA 2012-15, Award 159086, Project Number 522727 linked to lead 510127) is an integral part of a broader project with the policy nonprofit Nesta aiming to use big data-driven methodology to uncover today's startup activities and the networks fueling the growth of startup hubs over time. An international dataset has been produced as a platform which others can build upon. Opening up the methodology is empowering startup, research and policy communities across the globe to generate data on their own cities - and jointly build the largest international, multisectoral dataset on high-growth entrepreneurship. The dataset has been collected, and my team developed methodology and code to analyse it. 

The data were found to be quite sparse (the network contained relatively few edges), and so it was first necessary to summarise them. Providing a good summary of the available data is necessary to form an accurate description, which in turn fosters (in this case) understanding of the factors influencing start-up development. We produced documentation describing the methodology and code, and supplied these to Nesta.

The tool was then used on the collected data, allowing a list of key observations to be gathered into a final document. Nesta will now share these observations with investors and legislators, to guide them in future decision marking aimed at promoting the development of start-ups.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>60B8D945-96D4-4B0D-8891-F5918F3A03FB</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545cd38be6fac1.93181005</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>My team and I have developed a number of new mathematical findings that help to explain the behavior of large networks (social, economic, financial, etc.) . This is important because such findings allow us to understand quantitatively what questions we can answer given a single snapshot of a network.

These findings have been reported at a number of world-leading institutions, among them Berkeley, Princeton and Stanford. The first important finding tells us about how to locate clusters within a network - for example, clusters of people in a social network who tend to interact more than would be expected in the absence of any specific network structure. The idea is quite general and can in theory be applied to any type of large network. 

The second important finding is about how to turn this discovery from theory into practice, in other words how to actually explain a large network in terms of many small clusters. The basic idea is to build a histogram-like representation of the network. This work has been featured in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, a high-impact journal.

The third important finding is as follows. A scientific challenge across fields is to understand what drives the interactions between nodes in a network. A fundamental concept is assortativity: the tendency of nodes to connect based on similar characteristics. Here we establish the mathematical foundations necessary to identify which characteristics determine a network's structure. We base our results on modularity: an intuitive and practically effective measure of assortativity, but one which lacks a firm theoretical grounding. We derive the limiting properties of modularity for large networks, putting it on a sound theoretical basis for the first time, and providing a new tool to quantify network structure. After validating our method on benchmark examples, we identify key characteristics that reflect assortativity in a multi-edge email network.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>These findings should help to support work in the sciences, commerce, and public policy.
