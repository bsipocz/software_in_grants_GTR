Examples include the re-use of foundations in urban re-development projects, or raising the height of existing flood embankments to account for sea-level rise due to climate change. The design requirement in such projects is to quantify how much higher load the foundation soil can take in order to enable the construction of a higher flood embankment or a heavier new structure on existing foundations.

In both foundation re-use and raising flood embankments the existing structure will have been in place for a long period of time (several decades) during which the foundation soil has been subjected to evolving anisotropy and to time-related processes of consolidation (dissipation of excess pore water pressures within the soil generated by the applied load) and creep (continued straining of the soil with insignificant change in effective stress). Both consolidation and creep processes cause additional ground movements dependent upon time. The consequence of these ground movements is the reduction in the void ratio which leads to the strength and stiffness increase in the soil with time. It is this enhancement of soil mechanical properties that enables an increase in applied load on existing foundation systems. However, there is currently little guidance on the degree or magnitude of increase in stiffness or strength of the founding soil with respect to the duration of creep or loading. This aspect of the time-dependant framework of soil behaviour is poorly defined, but has significant implications in terms of the sustainability of civil structures.

The proposed research is very timely in addressing design needs for sustainable construction and redevelopment of existing infrastructure. It relies on the development of new experimental equipment consisting of an advanced triaxial creep apparatus, and will enable the apparatus to be properly commissioned for the first experiments to be performed. Long term experiments exploring the effect of creep on the strength and stiffness of clay have not been performed before and the lack of experimental data on this topic is hindering the ability of both research and industry to account for or quantify improvements in engineering properties due to creep processes.

Project partners, Arup, have a strong interest in supporting and collaborating in research into geotechnical engineering issues and are providing soil samples in addition to settlement records and load estimates from some structures founded on the same soil that have experienced very large and long-term settlement behaviour. This input will provide am active and pertinent focus for the project.
The database of experimental behaviour which can be generated by a cell designed to monitor soil sample creep accurately and stably in the long-term will enable constitutive models to be calibrated to aid design using numerical analysis methods. The principal aim of the project is to quantify the improvement to strength and stiffness from periods of creep to gain a better understanding of the effect of time on the evolution of soil behaviour which has been notably absent from previous studies. This is a novel approach in the study of the time dependant behaviour of soil and it is of note that previous studies have been unable to study the effect of significant periods of creep, due to the lack of time and capability for accurate and stable long term measurement of sample volume change. The Imperial College Geotechnics Laboratory are unique in their expertise and facilities to be able to tackle this challenge.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research will have the potential to contribute towards evidence based policy on sustainable engineering design, such as flood embankments and foundation re-use. A comprehensive dataset on the evolution of soil behaviour will influence and inform practitioners and professional practice on the magnitude of strength and stiffness gains in soil over a given period of time.

Society stands to benefit from this research through improvement in design and renovation of flood defenses which guard the population from the societal and economic damage of flooding events. The severity and frequency of which are predicted to increase due to climate change. This will improve national security in terms of protecting against the effects of climate change.

The more efficient re-use of existing foundations, due to a better understanding of soil behaviour stands to reduce the energy and materials required to construct new foundations. In addition to reducing the environmental impact, this also has the potential to reduce total building costs.

Consulting engineering firms will have interest in the outputs of this research as it will generate a database of experimental data for the calibration of consultancy in-house numerical analysis programs. Better numerical models of soil behaviour will allow more sustainable engineering design for both new build and redevelopment projects.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-01-06</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>98347</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>International Conference attendance and presentation at the 3rd international conference Geotec Hanoi - Geotechnics for Sustainable Infrastructure Development 24-25 Nov. 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8F30C858-EB8A-497A-B01E-ED2F6BBD4ACC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Submission of a 6 page conference paper titled: &amp;quot;Effect of time on the evolution of soil behaviour: new advanced triaxial creep cell experiments&amp;quot;.

The newly commissioned and calibrated triaxial creep cells were then used to test intact samples of Old Bay Clay under different creep durations. The project saw the completion of tests on intact Old Bay Clay samples subjected to creep durations of 0, 1, 3 and 6 months. Comparison of the strength and stiffness measurements made in these new testing apparatus will allow the impact of creep loading on the strength and stiffness of Old Bay Clay to be quantified. In addition, the data from the creep tests were able to be shared remotely with the project partner, Arup, via a online file sharing facility.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This initial small data set can potentially be added to with longer creep durations and a range of different materials to improve our understanding of soil under creep loading and thus improve our ability to predict long terms settlements with greater accuracy and potentially improve our ability to reuse existing foundations in redevelopment projects. The data obtained in this project can be used by others working in Old Bay Clay as it provides useful strength and stiffness values in addition to basic classification values.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>04AA2C95-6DFF-45C8-AD9C-07ECC60EA78B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58b6cdbd468369.65553065</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Construction</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Database including:
