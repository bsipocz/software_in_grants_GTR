Specifically, the research will involve synthesis of nanoparticle materials (at UCL) which will then be made into small rechargeable sodium ion batteries and tested in SHARP uk labs. The project will then involve scale-up of the highest performing materials and they will be made into larger cells which will validate the materials on scale-up. 
Until recently, NIB technology had been neglected and work focussed on Li ion based systems. Developments in materials chemistry and electrode fabrication are necessary to ensure NIB is a commercially viable alternative to Li ion batteries (LIB). The invention of new materials for use as anodes in these batteries is an important step in preparing the technology for market. We have identified a range of materials which we believe are suitable for use as high energy density anodes. We propose to synthesise a number of these materials, using state of the art synthesis facilities, and subject the new materials to extensive testing and optimise the most suitable materials for use in an energy storage device. As well as developing an optimised anode material for NIB (as well as validate new manufacturing facilities up to pilot plant scale) we anticipate that the materials developed as part of this project are likely to find uses in other technologies, both new and existing, e.g. LIB and supercapacitors.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The use of rechargeable domestic energy storage devices will have an impact on the Uk with benefits to consumers, energy suppliers and industry in the UK, spanning all three elements of the trilemma. 
Impact on Consumers: Peaks in domestic electricity demand do not coincide with peak solar generation. PV consumers export during the day and buy electricity from the grid during the evening. Storage is a clear partner and is often seen as being essential to the mass uptake of renewables. Installation of a storage system which charges during peak generation and discharges during the evening could reduce the consumer's electricity bill by 15-20% and ensure a continuous supply - greater self-sufficiency with some households being almost &amp;quot;off-grid&amp;quot;. If electricity suppliers were to charge a premium for periods of peak demand the savings made by installing a storage system would be greater. The use of renewable in this way will reduce the possibility of blackouts and not only gives consumers confidence in the security of their supply but also encourages individuals to take more responsibility for their own carbon footprint. If individual systems are connected, savings for consumers could be even greater. Access to cheaper electricity in this way may also result in an increase in the number of electric vehicles on the road - reducing the number of petrol and diesel vehicles. 
Impact on energy suppliers: Such systems could also be utilised by energy suppliers as part of the distribution network to smooth demand. The ability to store electricity in homes also offers the possibility of the UK being more resistant to adverse weather conditions which can sometimes lead to power shortages due to part of the grid being damaged. Of course these technologies would be even more important in remote parts of the UK or the world which are off grid, significantly improving quality of life. 
Impact on Uk industry: here are also financial benefits for UK industry as high electricity costs result in some manufacturers stopping production for periods during the winter. Storage systems could be used to spread the demand more evenly, e.g. charging during the weekend when many factories are closed. Continuous manufacture in this way will result in greater productivity and efficiencies for UK industry. Installation of energy storage in homes and workplaces will mean that electricity is used nearer to where it is generated and also that peak demand will be lower. Energy storage which is distributed in this way will significantly reduce the cost of upgrading the transmission network. Another benefit of local consumption is a reduction in the losses during transmission (typically 10%) - a financial and environmental benefit. 
Government / Public Sector:Emissions from fossil fuel burning plants are associated with a number of adverse health effects and enabling a switch to renewables will lead to a reduction in airborne pollution, in addition to combatting climate change. With legislation to guarantee a cascade of international agreements to reduce CO2, vehicles emissions and other greenhouse gases to acceptable levels, battery technologies for domestic storage are of prime importance to policy makers and legislators. The relevant applications include developing an uninterrupted power supplies (useful during brownouts), microgeneration and storage of energy (or to feed into the grid) which could include that generated from renewables such as solar energy.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>98781</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Sharp Laboratories of Europe Ltd</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>sharp work on sn anodes for na ion</gtr:description><gtr:id>CAD65F2D-8D3E-4607-A87C-F14B73801C90</gtr:id><gtr:impact>knowhow on how to make na ion batteries (multidisciplinary)
