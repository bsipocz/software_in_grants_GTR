&lt;p>In the past three years, we have recruited a large group of face-blind individuals, and have used EEG-based methods to assess the sources of their face recognition problems. So far, our results have shown that some face-blind individuals have impaired visual memory for familiar faces. For others, access to these face memories is disrupted. We have also found initial evidence that face perception is atypical in face-blindness. We will now test whether this affects specific aspects of face perception, including the perception of salient face parts, the global processing of facial configurations, or the perception of faces from different viewpoints. We will use eye-tracking to study whether face-blind people look at faces differently, and whether they use different parts of a face when trying to identify it.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This research will expand our knowledge of why some people have severe deficits in face recognition. Such deficits can have an enormous impact on their social lives.

and related impact activities in the coming years,

- Organisation of an annual face-blindness Open Day Event at Birkbeck, aimed to provide people with prosopagnosia in the London area with an opportunity to meet each other and to learn about recent research findings. Our first Open Day held on 20 September 2011 was attended by about 40 DPs, representing the largest meeting of DPs ever. See article in the face-to-face newsletter edition: http://www.faceblind.org/links/Face%20to%20Face%20Newsletter%20-%20Winter%202012.pdf 

- Contributions to a bi-annual newsletter (&amp;quot;Face-to-Face&amp;quot;), available at faceblind.org (4 issues to date). Its aim is to keep DPs and interested members of the public updated about the latest prosopagnosia research, about our ongoing and planned research studies, and to share stories and experiences. We are currently planning the first edition of our own London-based newsletter.

- Maintaining a dedicated facebook page for London-based DPs: http://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=173408949437929&amp;amp;id=100003064768549#!/groups/117013401655030/


- Contributing to meetings of the London-based DP support group and hosting it on a quarterly basis at the Henry Wellcome Building. We will provide drop-in and information sessions, which are particularly important for those DPs recently diagnosed so that they meet other people similarly affected and to get a more in-depth understanding of their condition. These sessions will be open to those currently attending the London Faceblind group at its location at the Westminster Pastoral Foundation building in Central London, recently diagnosed participants that were tested in our lab, and other DPs that we will notify of the group via both the faceblind.org website and the DP facebook group. 

In addition to providing a forum for individuals with DP, we also aim to contribute to the public understanding of DP and its nature as a common and serious condition by communicating our research findings to the media, and facilitating contacts between the media and individuals with DP that will increase public understanding of this condition. Recent press coverage on DP includes articles in the The New York Times (26 December 2011), Sunday Times (20 November 2011, The Daily (8 June 2011), the British Medical Journal (23 March 2011), the Daily Record (20 March 2011), Science News (10 December 2010), and The New Yorker (30 August 2010).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>379354</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Developmental prosopagnosia (DP) is surprisingly common and can cause serious social difficulties.

Update on our impact-related activities (reported after the end of the award period, February 2017):

The London-based group of DPs involved in our research is the world's largest group, and has become a focal point for formal and informal contacts between DPs, and for a series of initiatives that go well beyond our core research into DP, as listed below. We have developed and increased these and related impact activities (participation in televised and radio coverage of DP, e.g. BBC Radio 4, ITV, Channel 4) in the course of this grant.
We organise an annual face-blindness Open Day Event at Birkbeck, aimed to provide people with prosopagnosia in the London area with an opportunity to meet each other and to learn about recent research findings. Our first Open Day held on 20 September 2011. During the duration of the current grant, two further Open Days were held at Birkbeck. On 20th June 2014 we hosted a &amp;quot;Prosopagnosia: Living with and Researching Face Blindness&amp;quot; Symposium, with over 50 attendees from locations across the UK. On 1st July 2015, we facilitated Face Blind UK holding their first Open Meeting, at our research institute at Birkbeck, which was attended by members with face blindness, directors of Face Blind UK and our lab's researchers.
The London Faceblind Group held support group meetings, every two months, in our research building, from the start of the grant. We also contribute to a bi-annual newsletter (&amp;quot;Face-to-Face&amp;quot;), available at faceblind.org (4 issues to date). Its aim is to keep DPs and interested members of the public updated about the latest prosopagnosia research, about our ongoing and planned research studies, and to share stories and experiences.

The objective of this grant was to obtain new insights into the factors that are responsible for the face processing deficits in individuals with DP, with a particular focus on impairments in face perception. To do this, we measured electrical responses to faces and other types of stimuli in participants with DP and compared these to responses measured for groups of age-matched control participants without face processing impairments.
This research project has successfully met all grant objectives, and obtained new insights into the factors that contribute to DP. Research findings have so far been published in 12 peer-reviewed publications, and several other articles are currently being prepared. Main achievements to date are now briefly described:
 
? We recorded electrical brain responses to normal upright intact faces and face images where the eyes, nose, and mouth were spatially scrambled, creating rather unusual-looking grotesque face images (Towler, Fisher, &amp;amp; Eimer, 2016, Cortex). Control participants showed clear differences in their brain responses to these types of faces within less than 200 milliseconds, demonstrating that their face perception system is very sensitive to any deviations from the expected canonical spatial layout of face images. In marked contrast, there was no such differential brain response in individuals with DP. This demonstrates a remarkable lack in the sensitivity of face perception mechanisms to extreme deviations from canonical face templates, which is likely to contribute to the face recognition problems in DP. Importantly, DPs show normal brain responses to Mooney faces (two-tone images can be readily perceived as faces, but do not include face parts that are recognizable in isolation; Towler et al., 2016, Journal of Neuropsychology), indicating that they can utilize holistic information about face structure for categorical discriminations between faces and non-face objects. We discuss the theoretical implications of these findings in an extensive review article (Towler, Fisher, &amp;amp; Eimer, in press, QJEP). 
? We showed that DPs are impaired in processing contrast Information from the eye region, which is critical for face recognition. Early face-selective brain responses in DP are less sensitive to contrast information in face images, and that this it is the eye region that is selectively affected (Fisher, Towler, &amp;amp; Eimer, 2016, Cortex). This provides the first direct evidence for a highly selective deficit in perceptually processing identity-related visual signals in DPs, which is likely to be a major contributor to their face recognition impairments.
? To test whether successful face recognition differs between DPs and control participants, e measured brain responses generated during face recognition (Parketny, Towler, &amp;amp; Eimer, 2015, Neuropsychologia). The activation of visual face memory for previously unknown learned faces and the subsequent conscious recognition of these faces were strongly delayed in DPs. Two of the DPs tested even failed to recognize an image of their own face during the experiment, and these DPs also showed no selective brain response to their own face.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Developmental prosopagnosia (DP) is surprisingly common and can cause serious social difficulties.
