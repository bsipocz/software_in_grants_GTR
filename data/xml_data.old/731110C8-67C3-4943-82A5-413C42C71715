For example, we use it when we measure the distance between two places. The distances used in the Pythagoras theorem learned in our school days are Euclidean. To generalize, suppose we have a number of objects with their mutual Euclidean distances, which form a Euclidean Distance Matrix (EDM) when orderly put into a matrix? What has amazed researchers is that this distance matrix contains rich information about locations of those objects. The solution of this has been famously solved as early as 1935 by I.J. Schoenberg and 1938 independently by G. Young and A.S. Householder.

However, as expected from real applications, full content of a EDM is rarely available. The situation becomes more difficult when the embedding dimension is enforced. For example, the embedding dimension is 3 in molecular conformation. In the application of wireless sensor network localization and positioning vehicles, the dimension is 2 or 3. The small embedding dimension forces the problem to be non-convex and the EDM cone cut by the embedding dimension becomes peculiar. Famous models that deal with this non-convex problem include the coordinate parameterization and SDP relaxation. The former is a polynomial optimization and the solution of latter has to be corrected in order to satisfy the embedding dimension. Both are of large scale and often end up at a local minimizer. The focus of current research is on efficient methods that find a global solution at fast speed in order to meet requirement of applications. 

The purpose of this project is to consider a new model that decomposes the peculiar geometry body of EDMs and treats each part differently. First, we keep the convex cone of EDMs in the model. Second, we represent the set related to the embedding dimension as a level set of a concave function and we penalize the concave function to the objective. Third, when we have a large number of range constraints (i.e., the well-known data box case) we either deal with them via H-weighting scheme or keep them explicitly. Therefore, the model can be adapted to real situation. Our model has a close link to the rank minimization problem that is undergoing significant change at the moment.

The key method that behind this new model is the Newton method based on the dual problem of the model. Our model is built with the aim that the Newton method can be structurally analysed. It will rely on new second-order characterizations of the orthogonal projection onto the convex cone of EDMs. Computable global optimality condition will be established for some special cases. This ensures that our algorithmic scheme is not just fast (being Newton's method) but also able to provide approximate solution of high quality. We will draw techniques from Google's PageRank algorithm, concave quadratic penalization from classical optimization, and majorization scheme from multi-dimensional scaling to facilitate our analysis and computation. We expect that good mathematics behind the model and the algorithm will be nicely harmonized with its numerical performance.

Our tasks will be then enhanced by engaging relevant practitioners. We plan to stress-test our theory as well as the algorithm by applying them to real problems from molecular conformation and wireless sensor networks. Our expectation will be that the solution produced will be good enough for the purpose of further analysis and the time taken will be fast enough to meet the realistic demanding of the end-users. By showing strong numerical performance, we will also keep in constant touch with Numerical Algorithms Group (NAG) aiming for the algorithm to be implemented by NAG in future. The results will also make a nice contribution to the Polynomial Optimization workshop planned in 2013 at The Newton Institute, Cambridge.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Both the engineering and the software industries will benefit from this project.

Engineering Industry: One of the applications is to the molecular conformation in computational chemistry. The resulting code from this project will enable many intractable yet important problems to be solved. Thus the potential impact of advances is significant for wealth creation. The PI and researchers related to this project will also benefit greatly in the way that the practical consideration will play an essential role in their research.

Software Industry: Software companies such as Numerical Algorithms Groups (NAG) only look for the best methods to implement. This project provides a valuable opportunity for the best research in this extremely important area to be recognized by NAG. The correspondence between NAG and the PI will be a unique feature in such a theory-dominated research project. NAG will be kept abreast of the latest advances and the PI will also benefit from knowing what has to be done in order for the algorithm to be implemented by software companies.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-04-24</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-04-25</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>157640</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have developed a highly efficient algorithm for Euclidean distance based embedding in a low-dimensional space. The algorithm could potentially be used for nonlinear dimensionality reduction for big data. Mathematical optimization theory has been established for this algorithm. The algorithm is robust for the cases where many data are missing. In particular, the algorithm can be adapted to the framework of Locally Linear Embedding (LLE, a widely used method for dimension reduction) for dissimilarity data.This is a new development after the project completed.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>To find the right users and engage them in explaining how the findings may be used. It is highly likely to be used if the practical data is obtained first with a clear purpose what is to be expected from the data. A potential application (a good amount evidences have been collected) is to healthy rehabilitation that uses haptic objects. Data visualization of the process could reveal how haptic objects should be better designed and developed. This new application could lead to significant practical development if funding is available for such a project.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>17F1277D-50AB-4F0D-9685-9CA025232960</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56cc671d1d47d6.04918104</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information
