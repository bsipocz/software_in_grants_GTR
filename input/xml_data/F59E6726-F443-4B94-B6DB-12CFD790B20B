It focuses on two fascinating paradoxes. During the archaic and classical periods the Greeks were a small and relatively impoverished peripheral people to the wider, older, richer and more powerful world of the Near Eastern empires, such as the Achaemenid Persian Empire. And yet already from the sixth century BCE various non-Greek societies that were subject to the Persians started to adopt and adapt various elements of Greek culture. The second paradox works in the opposite direction. While Roman literature, for example, is in a direct intertextual relationship with Greek literature, and Roman art explicitly refers to the models and styles of Greek art, there is effectively nothing equivalent in the case of Greek and Near Eastern cultures: Greek culture gives the appearance of a closed system which might borrow but does not imitate. There is no doubt that the closed nature of Greek culture is an illusion and that it was deeply indebted to its interaction with other cultures; nevertheless, this peculiar and mediated form of cultural interaction needs to be explained. This project will study the many ways in which these two paradoxes are interrelated and explain each other. \n\nIn order to study the interactions between Greeks and Barbrarians we need to situate them within four parallel worlds. The first is the world of networks moving people, goods, and ideas/technologies within the area extending from the Western to Eastern Mediterranean and beyond. The second is the world of apoikiai (colonies), the organised Greek communities which dotted the whole Mediterranean and the Black Sea. The third is the Panhellenic world, a decentralised, imaginary Greek community maintained by shared yet divisive activities, spaces, meanings and projects. The fourth is the world of cultural interaction created by the empires of the East and the variety of ways in which Greeks and non-Greeks interacted within this imperial framework. \n\nIn combination, these parallel worlds created three important phenomena. The first is the Greek and non-Greek diasporas created by trade, mercenary service, immigration, enslavement and exile. The second is the complex process of globalisation: the emergence of a material and cultural koine, whereby various people and communities might come to participate in a world of shared symbols and meanings, use a shared form of material culture, employ a shared means of communication and even partake of shared forms of identity. The third is that of 'glocalisation': the use of elements of the global koine to express or redefine local culture and practices or even to resist the very process of globalisation. The formation of Greek culture, as well as its' widespread influence on non-Greek communities, has to be understood within the globalising and glocalising processes unleashed in various ways within the four parallel worlds described above. \n\nBecause the project is centred on the four worlds and the two paradoxes described above, its main focus is the Eastern Mediterranean in the archaic (800-480 BC) and the classical (479-323 BC) periods, when the Greeks did not rule over non-Greek societies but were often ruled by the empires of the East. Nevertheless, the project will also devote a significant amount of space to the Hellenistic period (323-31 BC), examining both the continuities with the processes of the archaic-classical periods and their intensification and expansion in space, as well as the changes brought by the creation of the Graeco-Macedonian monarchies that ruled over non-Greek societies in the aftermath of the conquests of Alexander the Great.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The impact of the proposed research can be assessed in two different ways. On the one hand, few topics in ancient history have attracted such significant attention among the wider public as the relationship between Greeks and Barbarians. To name merely the more recent examples, two expensive Hollywood productions, Oliver Stone's 'Alexander' on the clash between the Macedonians and the Persian Empire and Zack Snyder's '300' on the Battle of Thermopylae have captured the public imagination and have stimulated important cultural and political debates in the media and the public sphere. The justifiable protestations of the Iranian government over the depiction of the Persians in '300' is an important reminder of the direct link between the historical topic of the relationship between Greeks and Barbarians and modern public policy and foreign affairs. The recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have been justified as a defence of certain key values, chief amongst which are freedom and democracy: the origins of this rhetoric lie squarely in the Persian Wars. Since the discourse of the clash between East and West originated with the ancient Greeks, the reassessment of this discourse within a new theoretical framework will potentially be of direct interest to the media and the cultural industry, both in terms of its widespread appeal and in terms of its implications for matters of public policy. It will also be of direct relevance for school and children audiences, whose attention to the topic has been significantly heightened due to media interest. \n\nThe second important aspect of impact concerns the modern public debates on globalisation, diasporas and multiculturalism. The importance of this project lies in particular in overcoming the presentism and limited perspective of current public debates on globalisation and multiculturalism. It is often thought that globalisation and multiculturalism are recent phenomena, novel layers over pre-existent and separate entities like the East and the West. By providing a wider historical perspective this project can contribute significantly to public policy debates. Current debates on the educational curriculum of a modern multicultural society will in particular benefit from a project that examines the formation of Classical culture within globalising processes and the formation of multicultural communities in antiquity.\n\nHow will the target audiences benefit from the current project? It will allow them to avoid the stereotypes and mistaken assumptions that often accompany the involvement and coverage of these issues by the media and the cultural industry. Even more, it will enable a significant expansion of the range of subjects covered by the media and the cultural industry which are based on the relationship between Greeks and Barbarians. On the one hand, it will extend the range of topics beyond warfare and confrontation, by taking into account the full extent of Greek-Barbarian cultural interactions. On the other hand, by showing how modern concerns can be related to the study of ancient history, it will further heighten public interest in the topic and the value of investing in its coverage and presentation by the media and the cultural industry. It will allow public policy forums to redraw the lines of current debates and stimulate new approaches by examination of how ancient societies dealt with important modern issues like globalisation, diasporas and multiculturalism. Finally, it will allow educators and designers of the educational curriculum to rethink the ways in which Classics can contribute to the educational needs of a multicultural society.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-03-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>58987</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>School visit (St Albans)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0B57645A-6ED6-4B5B-AB03-3E3FAF087034</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The talk sparked questions and discussion.

It has examined in detail four parallel worlds in which interactions took place: the world of networks moving goods, people, ideas and technologies; the world of colonies; the world of empires; and the Panhellenic world and its interactions with non-Greeks. This work has revealed two significant paradoxes. On the one hand, while the Greeks constituted a small and impoverished periphery compared to the older, richer and more powerful societies of the eastern Mediterranean, the diverse and extensive ways in which these societies adopted the culture of the Greek periphery requires explanation. On the other hand, Greek culture was deeply shaped by its interaction with foreign cultures, but in a paradoxical way. Greeks did not directly adopt foreign styles, contribute to foreign genres or translate foreign texts; instead they incorporated foreign influences within their peculiar cultural repertoire that provided exalted positions for aspects of foreign cultures. In order to explain these paradoxes, I have shown that we need to situate the study of cultural interactions between Greeks and non-Greeks within the wider processes of globalisation and glocalisation in antiquity. The outcome of these processes is the emergence of a koine, in which individuals and communities participate in a world of shared symbols and meanings, use shared forms of material culture, employ shared means of communication, and even partake of shared forms of identity (globalisation); but this global koine is also adopted and adapted in diverse ways by local communities (glocalisation). Greek culture had a paradoxical form, because of the peculiar way in which Greeks interacted with other communities in the global world of the ancient Mediterranean; and it had a paradoxical influence, because of the its peculiar form, as well as due to the peculiar form of globalisation and glocalisation in the first millennium BCE Mediterranean. By exploring globalisation and glocalisation in the ancient Mediterranean we can understand both the paradoxical form and influence of Greek culture and situate it alongside other contemporary currents of globalisation.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The study of the processes of globalisation and glocalisation in the ancient world has great potential both academically and in terms of its impact on the contemporary world. It has provided a new way of thinking about cultural interaction, that can be fruitfully expanded to explore similar phenomena in the first millennium CE and later. By situating the study of ancient cultures within processes of globalisation it makes possible to overcome the Eurocentric form of history which is still dominant, in favour of an alternative form of global history. On the other hand, by showing that globalisation and glocalisation are not recent phenomena of the last few decades, but processes with a deep past, it can expand significantly the chronological horizon of current debates about multiculturalism and identity politics. By showing how crucial elements of modern Western culture have been shaped by global processes of interaction it can make a major contribution to e.g. debates about educational curricula.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C211E0B8-1871-4937-A46C-D0C499E8D10F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545c9f585bb747.66179884</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2BB1CAE0-F863-463F-BB8C-2C348BE7E010</gtr:id><gtr:title>ETHNICITY AND GREEK HISTORY: RE-EXAMINING OUR ASSUMPTIONS</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Bulletin of the Institute of Classical Studies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/170743c7658affafca5471dbbae5c265"><gtr:id>170743c7658affafca5471dbbae5c265</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>VLASSOPOULOS K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56d86c878f85e0.23306517</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E5EE5974-BB16-4B46-8E13-5FD4B758CF4C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Greeks and Barbarians</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/60addd61be8f644e485be67ad7a3da88"><gtr:id>60addd61be8f644e485be67ad7a3da88</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Vlassopoulos</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780521148023</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>545ca6e8b2abe0.66263768</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E8660B57-10AF-4ED5-9E33-93DC8316CB9E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Unthinking the Greek Polis: Ancient Greek History Beyond Eurocentrism</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/60addd61be8f644e485be67ad7a3da88"><gtr:id>60addd61be8f644e485be67ad7a3da88</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Vlassopoulos</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781281153760</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>545ca6ea756ef5.34621553</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9AA87FB3-5B3F-4BE8-B15C-3F8C3F4EDBBB</gtr:id><gtr:title>Greeks and Barbarians</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/561af15e4418b4361d0797872eee91d1"><gtr:id>561af15e4418b4361d0797872eee91d1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Vlassopoulos Kostas</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780521148023</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>i_11880747063bf2a978</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I022171/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DCE73056-5E3D-4976-B573-234E5FF4D633</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic &amp; Social History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
