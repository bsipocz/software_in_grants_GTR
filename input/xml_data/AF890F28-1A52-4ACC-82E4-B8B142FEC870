Youtube is a sign of things to come. This project's aim is to investigate the usually hidden 'engine room' of the editing suite in amateur and professional communities. The approach to investigating editing arises out of a concern with its practical skills. The research questions therefore are: &lt;/p> 
&lt;ul> 
 &lt;li>What is editing as a form of work and what are the diverse creative skills which go into editing together movies?&lt;/li> 
 &lt;li>How do editors, professional and amateur, analyse and assemble materials? &lt;/li> 
 &lt;li>What can social scientists learn from these experts in this kind of video-analysis?&lt;/li> 
 &lt;li>What sorts of dialogues, agreements, disagreements and forms of reasoning underpin editing?&lt;/li> 
 &lt;li>What is involved in becoming a competent editor? &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul> 
&lt;p>Appropriate to such a project, video-ethnography is the methodology that will underpin the investigation and will be developed by its engagement with experienced video-makers. Ethnography is the systematic study of the relationship between accounts and actions. Fieldwork will involve immersion in seven editing communities, specifically: home editing 'rooms', a community resource centre, a wedding video-maker, a live-edit suite, a mobile edit suite, and two professional suites.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>316467</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>'Here's one I prepared earlier' : demonstrating editing techniques</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:id>F47F5D30-83D9-4AAE-9838-51C570E2FD29</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presented at a video production workshop, The Mobility Studio, Stockholm.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-8158392122.162872aac5732</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Editing extreme sports videos</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:id>0176280E-2192-4D71-AE87-5482B7430CB5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presented at the video editing workshop, Microsoft Research, Cambridge.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-980582377.85527712aab0f9e</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Mid-cut, between logging and final cut</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:id>CD04CDDE-D23B-4BD7-A9B5-4D44D1D7248E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presented at the 3rd Video on Video Workshop, University of Edinburgh.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-3088592787.35573672a9a7364</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The intersubjective work of imagination in film editing :</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:id>3A174EBC-8828-447E-AC70-7BA6770B89E3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>(Title continued) proposals, suggestions, replays, pauses, animations, instructed-seeings, instructed-hearings, directions, rejections, reviews, assessments, formulations and other ways of producing possible sequences</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-1519569681.50992852b0621d6</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:year>2011</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>An overview of video practices, professional and popular</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:id>D289D22A-B4DB-4C29-8A54-A5C5605BD839</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Video activities in domestic and professional settings are still a relatively new domain of investigation yet a growing one with the increasing spread and varied use of video technologies.

We are now faced with an interesting meeting between these two in video studies of video activities. In this paper I will sketch out a map of this emerging area and also draw on a number of ethnographic studies of editing settings made during the ESRC-funded Assembling the Line project in order to reflect on where this research might take us in understanding video work.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-1520038462.7282982b061d1c</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:year>2011</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The intersubjective work of imagination in film editing :</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:id>9DAE31FD-2E4B-4E21-9D35-5660D677D707</gtr:id><gtr:impact>(Title continued ) proposals, suggestions, replays, pauses, animations, instructed-seeings, instructed-hearings, directions, rejections, reviews, assessments, formulations and other ways of producing possible sequences</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-650915671.7461682b061f92</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:year>2011</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Research with, on and about video</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:id>4FE559DA-EC81-447F-A104-5F4D274E7573</gtr:id><gtr:impact>An overview of the project, video practices and developments in social science methodologies and analysis of video.

Drawing upon existing ethnomethodological studies, predominantly of architectural practice (Murphy, 2004) I will pursue imagination as the intersubjective task of seeing the film-that-is-to-come through what is currently completed, what is missing and what can be added. The routine feature of the editing suite that this turns upon are cycles of reviewing sequences and proposing what should be done next with each sequence. The relationship between review and selection in editorial work has previously been studied in newspaper offices (Clayman and Reisner, 1998) but not documentary production.



I will present one of these film editing cycles in detail, where the editor and director are discussing the transition between two scenes. Their work begins by reviewing the sequence which the editor has recently completed editing. During their review both editor and director provide assessments of the sequence as it currently stands. Moreover in doing their expert editorial assessment of the sequence they delaminate it into the audio and the picture. Some of the problems raised by the director entail technical solutions which in turn make relevant the workplace identity of director and editor.



The fixed interface of Final Cut Pro's layout is less central however to the collaborative workplace editing of film is than video's properties as an animate and audible medium. Video/film is play-able which means that it is also cue-able, roll-able, loop-able, interruptible, extend-able, scrub-able and so on. These properties are realised in, and are constitutive resources, for the analysis and production of sections, clips and sequences. The centrality of the manipulation of video to editing is demonstrated through how both director and editor assess, propose and select what footage to add (and remove) for the next edit of the documentary.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-1514458881.23890282b062442</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:year>2011</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The project findings are informing the design of mobile video editing tools.

-video editing as a form of work 
-the workplace where editing happens 
-the diverse practical and creative skills which go into editing together movies 

The project looked at how editors, professional and amateur, analyse and assemble the audio-visual materials they have at hand. It drew out the lessons for social scientists doing video-analysis can learn from vernacular expertise. This was achieved in part through documenting and describing the forms of dialogue, agreement, disagreement and reasoning that underpin editing. Detailed analysis of video editing practice captured the 'accountability' of cutting decisions in real time as they are done, as well as preceding and succeeding the edit. This revealed the complex skills involved in becoming not only a competent but also an excellent editor, as understood via learning by doing.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Home Movies

? Home movie editing continues a tradition of home production (e.g. sewing clothes, dark rooms in the house).
? It makes heavy use of certain editing technologies to do so (e.g. the cross-cut dissolve &amp;amp; pre-made templates).
? The sharing of these products has been enabled and transformed by video content sharing sites (e..g Youtube, Vimeo etc.).
? Central to the logics of the home movie are desires for and logics of commemoration, recollection and the giving of the movies themselves as gifts.

Professional Editing

? Editors that have worked across linear tape-based and non-linear tapeless production continue to reflect on and provide insights into transformations in technology, technique &amp;amp; organisation.
? Editing traverses conventionalised production (e.g. sports highlights) to creative (e.g. cinema release documentary) that have distinct practices and timeframes.
? Institutional asymmetries between director/producer &amp;amp; editor are constituted and drawn upon as resources in organising the work of editing.
? Creating the video-to-come draws upon professional imaginations that can see it, in audio-visual media that are opaque to the untrained observer.
? Epistemic access to video media relies upon the skills of the editor in marshalling and playing just what is required for the production team to work on the video materials.

Social Sciences

? Editors are vernacular video analysts and thus we can learn from them what more video analysis might be.
? Social sciences can borrow both techniques for video products but also techniques for organising, viewing, sharing and archiving video recordings of social practices.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C141D397-F2D8-4FE7-BC92-A323E987D445</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544a5246c84dc6.97456363</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.ericlaurier.co.uk/assembling/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6EA8ABD2-12FF-4E38-AFA9-DC2436A29E51</gtr:id><gtr:title>New visual technologies: shifting boundaries, shared moments</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Visual Studies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/81406f2a729ec6c27609194151de59fd"><gtr:id>81406f2a729ec6c27609194151de59fd</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Graham C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cf9df9d1981f68</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>13F834BE-2026-4BDB-92C7-775ECC8E5C18</gtr:id><gtr:title>Dissolving the dog</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d589b2ef28b986c39fde64608b621edf"><gtr:id>d589b2ef28b986c39fde64608b621edf</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Eric Laurier (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>r_9735113465cb4d4fb4</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B0288999-C708-447F-812A-8AA487372296</gtr:id><gtr:title>Video Analysis: Lessons from Professional Video Editing Practice</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Forum: Qualitative Social Research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d589b2ef28b986c39fde64608b621edf"><gtr:id>d589b2ef28b986c39fde64608b621edf</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Eric Laurier (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2008-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>r_5487718909cb2aaa72</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>101BFE15-2C9B-4490-8A38-5ECBC8D141E1</gtr:id><gtr:title>Visual Analysis.
