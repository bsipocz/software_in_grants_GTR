substance abuse treatment: a cross-cultural research learning alliance</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/K002589/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Context
Intimate partner violence (IPV) (physical, sexual or psychological abuse) occurs in all countries, cultures and among all ethnic groups; however, there are culture-specific characteristics that need to be considered in prevention and treatment including: cultural definitions and expectations of appropriate sex roles, belief in the inherent superiority of males and acceptability of violence in conflict resolution. Despite this, our understanding of the role that cultural beliefs play in IPV perpetration is limited. 

Males in substance abuse treatment are more likely to be violent towards their female partners than non-substance abusers. Research suggests that 34-68% of men in substance abuse treatment have a history of IPV. Despite this, many perpetrator interventions do not address substance use, and therefore, reach far fewer individuals than substance abuse treatment programmes could. As a result, it has been argued that treatment for IPV should be integrated into substance abuse treatment. Currently, most substance abuse services lack the competencies to respond effectively to IPV. Few studies have examined IPV perpetration among substance abusers. None have examined cross-cultural issues. 

Aims
This project will examine and compare the prevalence and cultural construction of IPV perpetration by males in substance abuse treatment in London and S&amp;atilde;o Paulo. In addition, current policies, treatment protocols and care pathways for male substance abusing perpetrators in both countries will be reviewed, and key stakeholders interviewed to identify the barriers and facilitators to working with this client group. The research will inform the development of an evidence and theory based cross-cultural capacity framework for working effectively with male perpetrators in substance abuse treatment. An International Learning Alliance Steering Group of expert academics, practitioners and policy makers from England, Brazil, Spain and the US will be establishe at the initiation of the project; to strengthen and support the exchange and dissemination of information, research, best practice and policy, and to determine how alcohol and drug services can best respond to IPV perpetration. In addition, local Learning Alliance networks of service users and providers, policy makers and academics will be established in both London and S&amp;atilde;o Paulo to develop cross-sector solutions to this complex problem, building on the knowledge transferred from this project into practice, thereby improving interventions for substance abusers who perpetrate IPV.

Potential applications &amp;amp; benefits 
The major potential benefit of this project is the capacity framework, developed collaboratively and inter-disciplinarily by members participating in the International Learning Alliance Steering Group and the local Learning Alliance networks in London and S&amp;atilde;o Paulo. The framework will consider how best to identify, assess and respond to intimate partner violence in substance abuse treatment and will clearly lay out the expected minimum standards for practice in working with perpetrators for the three levels of the substance abuse treatment workforce. 

The mainstreaming of IPV perpetration interventions to substance abuse treatment will ensure that perpetrator interventions reach a wider number of perpetrators than the Criminal Justice or Domestic Violence programmes alone and may decrease substance use and violence and improve the family functioning as a whole. In addition, these local partnerships between the substance abuse and domestic violence sectors will foster collaborative and cross-agency working; and raise awareness of the need for integrated policy for both sectors. 

Annually, IPV costs in the UK are estimated at &amp;pound;36.7 billion. Potential benefits of this work include the reduction of IPV perpetration by male substance abusers that should lead to a reduction in the resulting financial burden.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Economic impact
With the total annual cost of IPV in England and Wales totalling over &amp;pound;15 billion(Walby, 2004), an effective response to IPV perpetration among substance users could reduce the economic and societal costs considerably. To see such a change would require the capabilities framework to be taken up across all of England, staff to be trained and interventions to be delivered. Therefore, the economic impact could be seen in the longer term(5-10 years) from the completion of the project.
 
Increasing effectiveness of practice and policy
The major potential benefit of this project is the development of a capacity framework and resources to assist the substance abuse treatment workforce to improve identification and service response to males who perpetrate IPV. The mainstreaming of IPV interventions to substance abuse treatment will ensure that IPV interventions reach a wider number of perpetrators than the Criminal Justice or Domestic Violence programmes alone and may decrease substance use and violence and improve the family functioning as a whole and human rights. 
The Capability Framework would ensure a more standardised and consistent approach to workforce development in this area, thus leading to increased detection and intervention. Dissemination of the Capability Framework for service abuse treatment services, is expected that the project and Learning Alliance will enhance staff competencies in working with IPV perpetrators who are substance users, and improve outcomes for victims in London and S&amp;atilde;o Paulo. Guidance will be cross-cultural and therefore applicable to other countries and cultures other than the ones involved in this project. The impact of the capabilities framework could be seen immediately following the completion of the project and would be expected to increase as the framework became integrated into standard practice.
In addition, the development of local Learning Alliance partnerships between the substance abuse and domestic vlence sectors will foster collaborative and cross-agency working; and raise awareness of the need for integrated policy for both sectors. CRI and Blenheim drug services are national service providers of substance abuse treatment enhancing the reach and impact of the Framework. Both providers have highlighted their support to addressing this complex issue in practice. By involving local commissioners and local and national policy makers in the Learning Alliances, then the likelihood of the project influencing future policy will be enhanced. Furthermore, Respect have a lobbying role with central government, therefore, this will ensure that substance use and IPV remain on the political agenda. Such enhanced relationships could be forged during the project but would be expected to take 3-5 years for a policy to be developed and implemented nationally. 

Societal impact
IPV is associated with poorer mental and physical health, substance abuse and HIV risk behaviours among victims (Golding, 1999;Campbell et al., 2002;Frye et al., 2007). In England and Wales, at least 750,000 children witness IPV every year. In addition, 52% of child protection cases involve domestic violence. Studies report that around 40% of men who perpetrated IPV were also violent towards their children (Slep &amp;amp; O'Leary, 2005). Males are more likely to become perpetrators of severe partner violence if they had witnessed interparental violence(Seabury et al., 2010). Both witnessing interparental violence and suffering physical abuse as a child result in an increased likelihood of mental health and substance abuse problems(Kernic et al., 2003) and IPV(Gil-Gonzalez et al., 2007), thus continuing the inter-generational cycle of substance abuse &amp;amp; violence. Improving the response to IPV perpetration by substance abuse treatment services should result in perpetrators' families experiencing less violence and associated consequences; and lead to breaking the intergenerational cycle of violence.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-04-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-03-17</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>284891</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Belgium, Kingdom of</gtr:country><gtr:description>International Learning Alliance</gtr:description><gtr:id>360E4BA1-1C11-46CE-B448-61AF107F9840</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None at present.

Local and international Learning Alliances of expert academics,
practitioners, voluntary organisations, charities, policy makers and service users were established in England and Brazil at the initiation of
the project to strengthen and support the exchange and dissemination of information, and determine how substance use treatment services
could best respond to intimate partner violence perpetration. This research examined and compared the prevalence and cultural construction of intimate partner violence perpetration by males attending treatment for substance use in England and Brazil. Government and local strategies, protocols and care pathways were reviewed, and interviews with key stakeholders identified the barriers and facilitators to responding to intimate partner violence among people in treatment for substance use. Findings from this research alongside stakeholder consultation with
Learning Alliance members has informed the development of this Framework for working safely and effectively with men who perpetrate
intimate partner violence in substance use treatment settings. The Framework aims to define and clarify the key capabilities (ie knowledge, attitude and values, ethical practice, skills and reflection and professional development) for working with men who use substances (drugs and alcohol) and who perpetrate intimate partner violence. It is aimed primarily at people who work within substance use treatment services, but it also relevant to those who plan and lead service developments within substance use sector including managers and commissioners.

The local Learning Alliance has met six times (including two international learning alliance meetings in London. Local learning alliance meetings were also held by the research team in Sao Paulo, and an additional International Learning Alliance meeting was held in Sao Paulo in March 2015.
1st international learning alliance - 27th March 2014 (London)
28 people attended the initial national/international learning alliance meeting of the project on 27th March 2014 held in the Wolfson lecture theatre at KCL. Participants included representatives from UK drug and alcohol treatment services, IPV organisations, drug and alcohol and IPV membership organisations (Adfam, Drugscope, Respect) Department of Health and Public Health England Representatives, Local Authority commissioners of adult services, researchers and service user representatives. Gail Gilchrist introduced the project, previous research on substance use and IPV and the project timetable. Carlos Moreno Leguizamon, (University of Greenwich) one of the project partners introduced the Learning Alliance methodology at which stake holders would be consulted and provided with early findings throughout the lifecycle of the project. Claudia Garcia Moreno of the WHO presented the issue of domestic violence from the perspective of WHO.
Presentations were made by representatives from Spain, UK, Brazil, Australia and the US on the prevalence of IPV perpetration amongst alcohol and drug users; treatment pathways, models of treatment, barriers to addressing ipv in the context of treatment and how health and substance use policies address IPV. Service users presented on their perspectives on this issue. 
1st local learning alliance - 10th July 2014 (London)
16 people including researchers, representatives from substance use services, the Home Office, PHE and substance use and IPV membership organisations attended a half day meeting at KCL . Early findings from a policy mapping exercise were shared with the group. Feedback was given from the first LA meeting and the group discussed how to take the research findings forward. 
2nd local learning alliance - 18th March 2015 (London)
15 people including researchers, representatives from substance use services, substance use and IPV membership organisations, the Department of Health and Public Health England attended a half day meeting at IOPPN. Preliminary findings from interviews with 223 men in treatment for substance use and qualitative interviews with 20 men who had been identified as perpetrators was shared with the group. Discussion took place regarding the value/interpretation of the findings and their implications for treatment services. 
3rd local learning alliance - 16th June 2015 (London)
Liz Hughes, author of the Dual Diagnosis Capabilities Framework and Colin Fitzgerald of Respect led a Learning Alliance meeting to consider the Capabilities required for substance use staff to work with perpetrators of IPV for the development of a Capabilities Framework document. The meeting was attended by 10 people including researchers and representatives from substance use treatment services, Public Health England and Respect. Liz Hughes presented the idea of a capabilities framework for treatment services and the group discussed knowledge; skill; attitude; ethical considerations and support required (learning, supervision etc) for staff to work safely with male perpetrators of intimate partner violence in the context of treatment services. This discussion contributed to the development of a Capabilities Framework documenthttps://www.kcl.ac.uk/ioppn/depts/addictions/research/drugs/Capabilities-Framework-Final.pdf 
4th local learning alliance - 8th December 2015 (London)
5 people including researchers and representatives from substance use, IPV organisations attended a meeting to discuss the Capabilities Framework document (see above) and to plan the agenda for the conference in February 2016
3rd International learning alliance - 2nd February 2016 (London)
End of Conference National and International Learning Alliance meeting, The Great Hall, King's strand campus. 180 people attended the end of project conference (including the local learning alliance members). Participants included representatives from substance use services, IPV victim and perpetrator services, adult service commissioners, police, community safety organisations, Community Rehabilitation Companies, national and international researchers, the England and Wales Department of Health, Public Health England and service user representatives. Organisations represented included NSPCC, Adfam, Rise (CRC), Kent Police, Terrence Higgins Trust, Swift Family Services, The Priory Hospital, housing charity, St Mungos' and representatives from 29 local authorities were represented. Members of the national and international learning alliances chaired sessions and presented their research findings and presented on their experience of being involved in the learning alliance.

Local and international Learning Alliances of expert academics,
practitioners, voluntary organisations, charities, policy makers and service users were established in England and Brazil at the initiation of
the project to strengthen and support the exchange and dissemination of information, and determine how substance use treatment services
could best respond to intimate partner violence perpetration. This research examined and compared the prevalence and cultural construction of intimate partner violence perpetration by males attending treatment for substance use in England and Brazil. Government and local strategies, protocols and care pathways were reviewed, and interviews with key stakeholders identified the barriers and facilitators to responding to intimate partner violence among people in treatment for substance use. Findings from this research alongside stakeholder consultation with
Learning Alliance members has informed the development of this Framework for working safely and effectively with men who perpetrate
intimate partner violence in substance use treatment settings. The Framework aims to define and clarify the key capabilities (ie knowledge, attitude and values, ethical practice, skills and reflection and professional development) for working with men who use substances (drugs and alcohol) and who perpetrate intimate partner violence. It is aimed primarily at people who work within substance use treatment services, but it also relevant to those who plan and lead service developments within substance use sector including managers and commissioners.

Local and international Learning Alliances of expert academics,
practitioners, voluntary organisations, charities, policy makers and service users were established in England and Brazil at the initiation of
the project to strengthen and support the exchange and dissemination of information, and determine how substance use treatment services
could best respond to intimate partner violence perpetration. This research examined and compared the prevalence and cultural construction of intimate partner violence perpetration by males attending treatment for substance use in England and Brazil. Government and local strategies, protocols and care pathways were reviewed, and interviews with key stakeholders identified the barriers and facilitators to responding to intimate partner violence among people in treatment for substance use. Findings from this research alongside stakeholder consultation with
Learning Alliance members has informed the development of this Framework for working safely and effectively with men who perpetrate
intimate partner violence in substance use treatment settings. The Framework aims to define and clarify the key capabilities (ie knowledge, attitude and values, ethical practice, skills and reflection and professional development) for working with men who use substances (drugs and alcohol) and who perpetrate intimate partner violence. It is aimed primarily at people who work within substance use treatment services, but it also relevant to those who plan and lead service developments within substance use sector including managers and commissioners.

Local and international Learning Alliances of expert academics,
practitioners, voluntary organisations, charities, policy makers and service users were established in England and Brazil at the initiation of
the project to strengthen and support the exchange and dissemination of information, and determine how substance use treatment services
could best respond to intimate partner violence perpetration. This research examined and compared the prevalence and cultural construction of intimate partner violence perpetration by males attending treatment for substance use in England and Brazil. Government and local strategies, protocols and care pathways were reviewed, and interviews with key stakeholders identified the barriers and facilitators to responding to intimate partner violence among people in treatment for substance use. Findings from this research alongside stakeholder consultation with
Learning Alliance members has informed the development of this Framework for working safely and effectively with men who perpetrate
intimate partner violence in substance use treatment settings. The Framework aims to define and clarify the key capabilities (ie knowledge, attitude and values, ethical practice, skills and reflection and professional development) for working with men who use substances (drugs and alcohol) and who perpetrate intimate partner violence. It is aimed primarily at people who work within substance use treatment services, but it also relevant to those who plan and lead service developments within substance use sector including managers and commissioners.

Local and international Learning Alliances of expert academics,
practitioners, voluntary organisations, charities, policy makers and service users were established in England and Brazil at the initiation of
the project to strengthen and support the exchange and dissemination of information, and determine how substance use treatment services
could best respond to intimate partner violence perpetration. This research examined and compared the prevalence and cultural construction of intimate partner violence perpetration by males attending treatment for substance use in England and Brazil. Government and local strategies, protocols and care pathways were reviewed, and interviews with key stakeholders identified the barriers and facilitators to responding to intimate partner violence among people in treatment for substance use. Findings from this research alongside stakeholder consultation with
Learning Alliance members has informed the development of this Framework for working safely and effectively with men who perpetrate
intimate partner violence in substance use treatment settings. The Framework aims to define and clarify the key capabilities (ie knowledge, attitude and values, ethical practice, skills and reflection and professional development) for working with men who use substances (drugs and alcohol) and who perpetrate intimate partner violence. It is aimed primarily at people who work within substance use treatment services, but it also relevant to those who plan and lead service developments within substance use sector including managers and commissioners.

Participants included representatives from UK drug and alcohol treatment services, IPV organisations, drug and alcohol and IPV membership organisations (Adfam, Drugscope, Respect) Department of Health and Public Health England Representatives, Local Authority commissioners of adult services, researchers and service user representatives. Gail Gilchrist introduced the project, previous research on substance use and IPV and the project timetable. Carlos Moreno Leguizamon, (University of Greenwich) one of the project partners introduced the Learning Alliance methodology at which stake holders would be consulted and provided with early findings throughout the lifecycle of the project. Claudia Garcia Moreno of the WHO presented the issue of domestic violence from the perspective of WHO.
Presentations were made by representatives from Spain, UK, Brazil, Australia and the US on the prevalence of IPV perpetration amongst alcohol and drug users; treatment pathways, models of treatment, barriers to addressing ipv in the context of treatment and how health and substance use policies address IPV. Service users presented on their perspectives on this issue.

Local and international Learning Alliances of expert academics,
practitioners, voluntary organisations, charities, policy makers and service users were established in England and Brazil at the initiation of
the project to strengthen and support the exchange and dissemination of information, and determine how substance use treatment services
could best respond to intimate partner violence perpetration. This research examined and compared the prevalence and cultural construction of intimate partner violence perpetration by males attending treatment for substance use in England and Brazil. Government and local strategies, protocols and care pathways were reviewed, and interviews with key stakeholders identified the barriers and facilitators to responding to intimate partner violence among people in treatment for substance use. Findings from this research alongside stakeholder consultation with
Learning Alliance members has informed the development of this Framework for working safely and effectively with men who perpetrate
intimate partner violence in substance use treatment settings. The Framework aims to define and clarify the key capabilities (ie knowledge, attitude and values, ethical practice, skills and reflection and professional development) for working with men who use substances (drugs and alcohol) and who perpetrate intimate partner violence. It is aimed primarily at people who work within substance use treatment services, but it also relevant to those who plan and lead service developments within substance use sector including managers and commissioners.

1st international learning alliance - 27th March 2014 (London)
28 people attended the initial national/international learning alliance meeting of the project on 27th March 2014 held in the Wolfson lecture theatre at KCL. Participants included representatives from UK drug and alcohol treatment services, IPV organisations, drug and alcohol and IPV membership organisations (Adfam, Drugscope, Respect) Department of Health and Public Health England Representatives, Local Authority commissioners of adult services, researchers and service user representatives. Gail Gilchrist introduced the project, previous research on substance use and IPV and the project timetable. Carlos Moreno Leguizamon, (University of Greenwich) one of the project partners introduced the Learning Alliance methodology at which stake holders would be consulted and provided with early findings throughout the lifecycle of the project. Claudia Garcia Moreno of the WHO presented the issue of domestic violence from the perspective of WHO.
Presentations were made by representatives from Spain, UK, Brazil, Australia and the US on the prevalence of IPV perpetration amongst alcohol and drug users; treatment pathways, models of treatment, barriers to addressing ipv in the context of treatment and how health and substance use policies address IPV. Service users presented on their perspectives on this issue.

Policy review
A policy review was conducted to examine drug and alcohol and domestic violence policy documents for England and Wales from 1998-2014. We found little integration in policy. Although drug strategy documents referred to the co-occurrence of substance misuse and domestic violence in families with complex needs, there was little attempt to encourage e.g. co-location of services for domestic violence perpetrators in substance use treatment services. In alcohol policy documents, there was a more explicit link made between alcohol misuse and domestic violence. Department of Health Guidance under the Labour government encouraged local alcohol commissioners to consider services for vulnerable alcohol users including those experiencing domestic violence. The Localism agenda (moving more decision making powers from central to local government) introduced by the Conservative/Liberal Democrat government in 2010 however changed the way that services for alcohol and drugs were commissioned and removed 'ring fenced', priority funding for alcohol and drug services. Policy for domestic violence has focused on safeguarding victims and prosecuting perpetrators. 

Views of policy makers
Policy makers interviewed were concerned that there is a lack of evidence of the prevalence and relationship between substance use and domestic violence. They agreed that there is a gap in provision for substance misusing perpetrators and emphasised the need for joint working arrangements and information sharing between substance misuse services and domestic violence agencies. 

Current practice
An examination of protocols and assessment guides used by three treatment providers in initial assessments found few specific questions concerning domestic violence perpetration although there were questions about victimisation and about general violence (outside the family). Interviews with substance misuse professionals confirmed that domestic violence perpetration in substance misusers tends to be uncovered opportunistically in the course of key work unless victims and perpetrators are both using the same service. Other themes that emerged in these interviews concerned the normalising of violence in drug misusing relationships, that although by no means all drug misusing relationships are unequal, where both men and women are substance misusers there tends to be gendered patterns of control by male substance misusers over access to female partners' drugs and health care for example. There was a lack of knowledge on the part of staff from substance misuse services concerning available services and care pathways for perpetrators of domestic violence outside Criminal Justice System provision. Perpetrators were not considered particularly difficult to work with by staff but they suggested that there is a lack of awareness of services and lack of confidence on the part of many staff in substance misuse services regarding how to address domestic violence perpetration in the course of key working. 

Interviews with substance use staff 
Interviews with substance use key workers and managers revealed: 

? Few staff felt confident or that it was a legitimate part of their role to enquire about IPV perpetration in assessments and ongoing work with people receiving treatment for substance use 
? Few staff were aware of referral pathways for IPV perpetrators outside the criminal justice system 
? Training received tended to have focused on safeguarding and services for IPV victims 

Interviews with men in substance use treatment
223 men receiving treatment for substance use in London and South East England were interviewed using questions that assessed the occurrence and frequency of victimisation and perpetration of emotional, physical or sexual intimate partner violence (IPV). Information was also collected on 10 adverse childhood experiences (emotional, sexual and physical abuse, witnessing inter-parental violence, being looked after, being neglected, parents separated/divorced or a parent died or either parent was absent), substance use, mental and physical health. 20 men who reported that they had perpetrated IPV were interviewed in-depth to explore their rationales for perpetrating IPV and the role of substance use in IPV perpetration. 

? average age 43, 38% of whom currently married/cohabiting or had an intimate partner 

? 87% unemployed or receiving benefits, 27% currently homeless 

? 53% were in treatment for drug use (mainly heroin, crack and cannabis), 17% were receiving treatment for alcohol and 17% were receiving treatment for both drug and alcohol use and 35% receiving treatment. 52% were poly drug users. 63% were drinking at hazardous levels. 

? 71% of men had experienced any childhood abuse (67% childhood physical abuse and 26% childhood sexual abuse). 76% had witnessed inter-parental violence as a child. The average number of adverse childhood experiences reported was 4.2 [maximum possible score 10] 

? 50% of men met criteria for probable major depressive disorder 

? 77% had ever perpetrated any (emotional, physical and/or sexual) IPV: 62% had ever perpetrated emotional IPV, 60% had ever perpetrated physical IPV (with/without emotional IPV) and 6% had ever perpetrated sexual IPV (with/without emotional and/or physical IPV) 

? 35% of men who had perpetrated physical IPV considered it a crime, as did 20% of those who had perpetrated sexual IPV 

? Mutual (perpetrator and victim) IPV most commonly reported (74%) 

? Experiencing a greater number of adverse childhood experiences and a higher hazardous drinking score predicted ever perpetrating any (emotional, physical or sexual) IPV 
In the in-depth interviews with 20 men who identified as having perpetrated any IPV, three narratives of IPV perpetration were distinguished: 

1. Disputes with partners that escalated to IPV perpetration in which substance use represented misuse of scarce resources/time and disputes that escalated to IPV perpetration related to the acquisition and sharing of substances 

2. IPV perpetration and victimisation that is explained/excused by alcohol/drug intoxication 

3. Accounts where substance use did not feature or was incidental to IPV perpetration. Here IPV was accounted for by sexual jealousy or harm to children 

In all types accounts of perpetrating IPV, stereotypical and prescriptive male/female roles provided a context for and made IPV perpetration explicable. 

Implications and recommendations 
? Given the high prevalence of adverse childhood experiences reported by men receiving treatment for substance use, and the association of adverse childhood experiences with any IPV perpetration; a trauma-informed approach to working with males who use substances is indicated 

? Staff working in substance use treatment are highly skilled in building rapport and discussing sensitive topics with people who use substances. 

? Substance use treatment services should identify gaps in knowledge, training and support needs for staff, and referral and care pathways for IPV perpetrators and victims 

? There is scope for the development of integrated interventions to address both substance use and IPV as well as sign posting and referral to specialist services 

? Substance use treatment services represent an opportunity to identify and respond to IPV perpetration 

? A Framework for working safely and effectively with men who perpetrate IPV in substance use treatment settings has been developed from the findings of this study, aimed primarily at people who work within substance use treatment services to define and clarify the key capabilities (i.e. knowledge, attitude and values, ethical practice, skills and reflection and professional development) for working with men who use substances (drugs and alcohol), and who perpetrate IPV.
