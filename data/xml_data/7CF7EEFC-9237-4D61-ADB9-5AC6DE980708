As technology has become embedded in virtually all aspects of everyday life, and more and more people are engaged in interactions with systems, it seems likely that the 'problem' of cyber-security will remain unsolved in the foreseeable future. While it has become accepted wisdom that cyber-security is a 'socio-technical' system, with both technical and human elements, making advances based on this understanding has proved difficult. In part this is due to the diversity of both people and the social contexts in which they live their lives, and the systems with which they interact. At the same time, the public discourse and guidance about cyber-security is confusing and often inappropriately targeted. For instance, the term 'cyber-security' can be used to encompass a wide range of attitudes, behaviours, technologies and threats ranging from authentication methods, SCADA systems, spear phishing and cyber-bullying, with interventions poorly targeted and overly technology-threat based. Crucially, however, the experience and understanding of the cyber-security problem is not the same for everyone and the cSALSA project seeks to address the fundamental challenge of how we can more fully understand a diverse range of cyber-security experiences, attitudes and behaviours in order to design better, more effective cyber-security services and educational materials. 

In the cSALSA project, we take a lifespan approach to studying how cyber-security is understood, and the attitudes and behaviours of people to cyber-security and risk. The project will study cyber-security across three main life stages - amongst young people, those of working age, and older people. The research project will focus on how people's attitudes and behaviours towards cyber-security and risk change across the lifespan in sync with their goals and aspirations, cognitive abilities and knowledge and ability to control and adapt their cyber-security behaviour. Importantly, we recognize that neither cyber-security related behaviours nor life course development occur in a vacuum. Rather, they are part of a complex inter-play of individual characteristics, elements shared with others in a particular life stage, and the dynamic context in which the person finds themselves. These contexts include aspects of family life, organizational structures, cognitive capacity and knowledge, and social support networks. 

We propose a three pronged approach to studying these three life stages: (1) research investigating how cyber-security is understood and framed in everyday language across the lifespan; (2) in-depth qualitative and quantitative work on cyber-security attitudes, knowledge and behaviour across our three points in life, with a specific focus on how the dynamics of people's lives influences how cyber-security is understood, risks appraised and talked about, and actions taken; and (3) specific work on metrics for cyber-security, and the development of new psychometrically validated measures of cyber-security perceptions and behaviours.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Cyber-security is a growing, global problem. Research that addresses the human dimension of cyber-security behaviour is highly valuable for both the identification and mitigation of threats, and for the design of technology and training that aligns how we think and behave with the technological tools to protect cyber-security. The cSALSA project will have impact in the following ways:

1. By adopting a novel approach to studying how people think about cyber-security, and how that connects to their behaviour
2. By working closely with partners in Government and Industry to ensure that our insights can have an impact on their practises.
3. By developing new methodologies that will provide a step change in how cyber-security is studied, and the ways in which interventions can be evaluated.
4. By developing our knowledge base and skills in the UK 

There are four major beneficiary groups: academics, government, businesses, and the general public.

Academic impact: Our inter-university consortium of will support the training of highly skilled researchers and facilitate the generation and transfer of new methods of research synthesis across the country by running a 'researcher exchange' programme as part of cSALSA, with post-doctoral and faculty researchers being seconded across different partner universities in the UK, as well as short placements in our industrial partners and hosting visitors from our overseas collaborators (PNNL in the USA, and Carleton in Canada). 

Government impact: It is intended that this work will assist in shaping the cyber-security agenda at national level. We will work with the new National Centre for Cyber Security to ensure that our work on metrics and measures contribute to the work of the Government on ensuring the cyber-security of the UK. Note that all members of the team have been active in supporting policy development at government love (see also letter of support from CESG).

Businesses: UK businesses will benefit from our work on metrics and measures. At present there are relatively few tools to measure cyber-security behaviour and attitudes in the workplace. We will work with our partners - BAE Systems and Hewlett Packard Enterprise - to ensure that our validated measures and metrics are appropriate and useable to the UK Business Sector. We will use these partners and the CyberInvest network to reach these targets.

Societal impact: The application of the results will contribute to increased well-being of citizens. Our work on how a diverse group of people understand, and respond to, cyber-security threats will help with the education of end-users, as well as in the development of new technologies that provide cyber-security while also supporting users' needs and goals. To this end, members of the team are already talking to relevant public facing bodies such as Cyberstreetwise and Age Concern.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-03-06</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>532397</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P011454/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
