By mapping previously untraced intersections between woodcraft organisations, founded in the interwar years, and other contemporaneous cultural movements including avant-garde artists and occultists, dress reformers and folklorists, this project will establish the significance of a largely forgotten aspect of British social and cultural history, adding to existing knowledge and offering new interpretations of a period rich with utopian ambitions.

This research will be the first to contextualise and interpret the unique, large-scale art and design outputs of such organisations, with a particular focus on the Kindred of the Kibbo Kift (1920-1951) but also including the related and continuing groups, Order of Woodcraft Chivalry, est. 1916, and the larger Woodcraft Folk, est. 1925. These progressive, open-air movements had their origins in the turn-of-the-century ideas of American artist and naturalist Ernest Thompson Seton (1860-1946), who promoted the outdoor life and Native American camp skills as a means of creating an adventurous educational experience for boys. These ideas were subsequently adapted by Baden-Powell and incorporated into his scouting movement. 

Woodcraft groups were largely formed in opposition to the Boy Scouts in its early years, particularly to its perceived militarism. As alternative youth movements, these co-educational and pacifist groups promoted camping, hiking, ritual and handicraft as means for radical social and economic reform. The ambitious visions of these dynamic organisations attracted thousands of members in their founding years and the support of significant writers, artists, scientists, sociologists and campaigners, including H.G. Wells, D. H. Lawrence, Julian Huxley, Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence, Mary Neal, Rabindranath Tagore, Augustus John and Patrick Geddes.

Although woodcraft experiments did not result in the establishment of new worlds, the organisations nevertheless developed a comprehensive vision for designing change. As woodcraft groups approach significant anniversaries, it is timely to reflect on their legacies and effects. These can be felt not only in their surviving adaptations and in the 21st century renaissance of interest in bushcraft survival skills for a post-oil world, but also in a range of current protest tactics, economic and educational reform agendas, new age practices and folk revivals. By examining the origins and precursors of these phenomena, Picturesqueness in Everything will provide fresh understanding of the present as well as the past.

In keeping with Seton's call for 'picturesqueness in everything', woodcraft groups considered the production of art, design, craft, ceremony and spectacle as central to their romantic, political and spiritual mission, not least in the case of Kibbo Kift, whose founder was a commercial artist and whose group attracted many creative practitioners (including, for example, celebrated photographer Angus McBean). Kibbo Kift's striking hybrid aesthetic combined Anglo-Saxon, Nordic, Egyptian and Native American motifs with occult symbolism and modernist graphics, and was visible across the tents, banners and totems, theatrical, ritual and camping costumes, printed literature and illustrated logbooks of the movement. These accomplished artefacts survive in quantity but remain largely unknown, despite the fact that they make visible the group's artistic and intellectual influences, and spiritual and educational agendas for social and cultural regeneration. Through the outcomes developed and disseminated during this fellowship, the extent and importance of these materials will be shown for the first time.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research will principally impact two main groups outside of academia: 

1) Youth groups
With 10,000 members nationally, the Woodcraft Folk is the largest continuing woodcraft organisation and the research produced in this project will offer a new understanding of the organisation's history for members, group leaders and the young people they support. As Woodcraft Folk approach their 90th anniversary, this research will feed into planned educational activities that seek to engage with the group's cultural heritage. As the historical consultant for these anniversary celebrations, the P-I will provide training for leaders on the history of the organisation, and in the development of historical skills for group members (such as oral history methods), as well as devising educational activities for younger members utilising historic resources. 

Members of continuing woodcraft groups will be interviewed to create new resources for historical understanding; as such, in keeping with oral history methodologies, they will construct and interpret their own histories. Members will also be invited to attend and participate in study days and events. As the project develops, research will be made available through outlines and updates in groups' newsletters and blogs, and through the P-I's contribution to woodcraft events. 

Beyond the membership of woodcraft organisations, larger charitable umbrella groups - such as the British Youth Council (representing over 200 youth groups, est.1948) and related global organisations, including International Falcon Movement / Socialist Education International (over 60 youth groups worldwide, est.1922) - share intersecting histories. Additionally, the connection between woodcraft and the World Scouting Organisation (40 million members worldwide) means that the research will contribute to larger international histories of scouting and youth education. The P-I will actively seek opportunities to disseminate research through relevant organisations' publications and events. 

2) Museums, Archives and Galleries
The exhibition at Whitechapel's Archive Gallery (proposal invited by the Archive Curator; currently under review by the programming team) will add new knowledge to the history of art institutions. The 1929 Kibbo Kift Educational Exhibition attracted 42,000 visitors and fitted within the Whitechapel Art Gallery's early didactic remit, which aimed to provide free, improving working class educational opportunities. The longstanding demotic tradition of the gallery, showing children's art, trade banners and flower shows, for example, alongside canonical fine art, provides the context for the Kibbo Kift exhibition. Current holdings relating to the original exhibition are sparse in the gallery's own archive; this research will provide new information about the social context, purpose and reception of the gallery's work. The ethos and legacy of early 20th century woodcraft ideals additionally fit with a number of areas that Whitechapel have been engaged with more recently, from the aesthetics of resistance (Protest and Survive, 2000; Reclaim the Mural, 2013) to art and utopia; they also intersect with interests of other art institutions (see the forthcoming Folk Art exhibition at Tate and Disobedient Objects at the V&amp;amp;A). As such, the content produced through this research will add to debates about art and social engagement in the museum environment. The study day, gallery guide and events will provide further interpretation for a range of audiences, including education professionals, artists, designers and the general public. 

Research outcomes will also directly benefit each of the supporting institutions (Museum of London, London School of Economics Archive and British Library Sound Archive) in the form of new collections information and interpretation, and new holdings (oral histories and visual data). Outlines and updates will be disseminated through their webpages and publications.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>130333</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>To accompany the 90th anniversary celebrations of the Woodcraft Folk, an organisation that aims to empower young people and which comprises 15,000 members, I staged a visual display of historical images and information at Dulwich Fort, London.

My talk explored the intellectual and personal connections that can be traced from the School to other educational, political, therapeutic and cultural endeavours throughout the 20th and 21st century. The session also included exploration of the contents of the Braziers Park archive, through a handling session which I devised with the Chair of the Committee of Management, and through discussions of possible funding routes for archival conservation and development.

The panel led to the development of a further workshop event at University of the Arts London in 2017, with the intention to develop an edited collection on the theme.
Conference abstract:
In looking back to create a new world, the 1920s camping and campaigning organisation, the Kibbo Kift Kindred mixed miscellaneous histories with futurist fantasies in their extensive visual output. Elements from prehistory to the medieval were incorporated into all aspects of the group's practice, from costume to conversation, but a return to the past was never the aim. The group's 1929 exhibition at Whitechapel Art Gallery was underpinned by an application of Ernst Haeckel's now discredited biogenetic law, where ontogeny (organism growth) was said to replay or recapitulate phylogeny (the evolutionary history of the species). Kibbo Kift thus recapitulated a teleological evolutionary cultural history in order to position themselves as its modernist outcome. 
The documents that outlined the 1929 exhibition's original purpose were repositioned as exhibits in the exhibition's 2015-16 reinterpretation. This took place, as before, at Whitechapel, but this time in the Archive Gallery, a dedicated space for working with archival art collections as well as revisiting institutional history. Cultural forms that look back are often described as retrogressive and as a search for stability in a time of crisis. Yet, as this paper will outline, in this context exhibition restagings are not so much re-enactments as historicist critique; they reveal the hidden transactions that shape curatorial decisions. In the case of Kibbo Kift, in addition, time was never stable or straightforward. Their pasts were largely imagined and always inflected by science fiction futures. To look back at Kibbo Kift now is to inhabit a complex temporality, for it is to look back at historical dreams that are yet unrealised. In reviewing the group's cultural legacy, Intellectual Barbarians: The Kibbo Kift Kindred, arguably performed another stage of historical recapitulation.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b9ecbc62f2e1.52703037</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.aah.org.uk/annual-conference/sessions2016/session34</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>'Fierce futurists and anti-establishment antiquarians: The historical vicissitudes of the Kibbo Kift Kindred', peer-reviewed conference paper, Radical Histories / Histories of Radicalism, Bishopsgate Institute</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0CC6B9FD-622D-4503-B241-E8F019619222</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The conference Radical Histories / Histories of Radicalism, held at Bishopsgate Institute, commemorated twenty years since the death of the left-wing social historian Raphael Samuel and forty years since the founding of History Workshop Journal. The event explored radical approaches to the past and histories of radical ideas and action through lectures, panels, performances, screenings, workshops and exhibitions. The event was hosted by Queen Mary University of London and organised by the Raphael Samuel History Centre (www.raphael-samuel.org.uk). It engaged a diverse audience, and brought together practitioners of many varieties of historical research, curatorship, writing and performance, from both inside and outside the academy. 
My talk took place in the Radical Heritage, Art and Culture strand, and explored the various ways in which one radical historical movement - the Kindred of the Kibbo Kift, of the 1920s - have been historicised since their inception. Conference abstract:
The Kindred of the Kibbo Kift was established in 1920 as an all-ages alternative to the scouts. For just over a decade, the group developed an idiosyncratic theory and practice of camping, hiking and handicraft in the hope of establishing world peace. The performance of particular pasts - from prehistoric and medieval as well as the more problematic ahistorical categories of the primitive at home and abroad - was a key part of Kibbo Kift's activities, and it also informed the eclectic styles of their prolific production of art, design and dress and theatre. This was in part due to the group's keen interest in folklore, inspired by the popularity of texts such as James Frazer's The Golden Bough, but it was also because of their promotion of a particular method of youth education (or 'Tribal Training') based in G. Stanley Hall's influential theory of recapitulation. In Hall's scheme, children needed to re-act specific periods of a linear conception of cultural history from 'savage' to 'civilised' in order to become fully developed adults. Kibbo Kift itself was described as a recapitulation of history. The creation of their carefully illuminated logbooks and detailed photographic records took place in parallel with an engagement with historical theory and pedagogy. Together these projects anticipated the coming of the Kibbo Kift Era. Although this modernist Utopia was never to arrive and the group remains mostly forgotten, this paper examines the Kindred's enthusiasm for history, the particular content of the retrofuturist artefacts they produced, and finally, the ways in which their histories have been crafted and contested since their demise.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58baaadbbe7b90.22172764</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.raphael-samuel.org.uk/radical-histories-conference-information/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>?Invited speaker on the history of the woodcraft movement, Supernormal Super Sensory Summer School</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E7B26E60-0CBD-44AF-A0BE-011F374BFBEB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I was invited to give a presentation on the history of the woodcraft movement, at the Supernormal Super Sensory Summer School, held as part of the Supernormal art and music festival at Braziers Park, Ipsden, Oxfordshire.

Since 1985 we have met regularly to discuss ideas and share research: not just on issues of history, but equally on present and future personal, social, cultural, educational and political matters. Nor is our focus just concerned with academic enquiry but research of any form and type including the experimental.&amp;quot; MayDay Rooms is an educational charity and &amp;quot;a safe haven for historical material linked to social movements, experimental culture and the radical expression of marginalised figures and groups.

The group states their interest and audience: &amp;quot;We're talking about people who craft, design, manufacture, tinker with, engineer, fabricate, and repair physical things. Art, craft, electronics, textiles, products, robots. Hi-tech and low-tech, amateur and professional, young and old, with digital tools or by hand.

The 2000-word review of the book in The Guardian by Jon Savage, a leading author on youth culture subjects, described it as 'a revelation'. The article attracted over 400 comments in its first week and was shared over 7000 times on social media in the same period. It propelled the book to the position of No.1 bestselling title in the Art and Photography category on Amazon.co.uk. 
Since the release of the book and exhibition (October 2015), I have been invited to speak on the topic in lecture and seminar series in a range of national and international locations including scout huts and pubs, museums and galleries, universities and bookshops, nightclubs and arts festivals, to varied audiences including youth groups, educators, psychotherapists, artists, designers, pagans, curators, academics and politicians. I have been commissioned to write for scholarly and popular publications, and the research has been translated into Czech, Norwegian and Swedish. Both book and exhibition have been widely reviewed in national and international news media, arts publications and scholarly domains, including features on BBC Radio 3 and Radio 6, and in print media in Belgium, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and USA. 
The exhibition was visited by over 125,000 people, and each of the accompanying talks, tours study days and creative events sold out. The book was nominated for Photobook of the Year 2015 by several organisations including PhotoEye and Photocaptionist. It won a 2015 award of &amp;pound;4500 from the Elephant Trust as well as a Swiss Federal Office of Culture design prize as a Most Beautiful Swiss Book 2015. As a winner of the Most Beautiful Swiss Books prize, the book appeared in a 2016 travelling exhibition that visited four cities in Switzerland, as well as Paris, Oslo, Vienna, Venice, Copenhagen and London. The book was reprinted in spring 2016.
Both exhibition and book were used as a basis for a 2016 fashion collection that was shortlisted for a London Fashion Week prize and directly inspired an extended fashion photography spread by Tim Walker, with set design by Simon Costin, in Vogue Italia in November 2016. I have had six invites to develop moving image treatments for film and television, and a Kibbo Kift-inspired album of creative musical responses is in production for a 2017/18 release. The book and exhibition has inspired performance art and sculpture (such as those staged at Supernormal Festival 2016) and images from the book have been repurposed by record labels, graphic designers and tattoo artists internationally.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>2768A361-5721-4092-93E7-23D183E16703</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d492920fd420.87266923</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The original objectives of this award have been met (and exceeded). The project aimed to uncover and interpret previously hidden histories of little-known cultural organisations who figured in the British woodcraft movement, 1916-2016 (such as the Kindred of the Kibbo Kift and the Order of Woodcraft Chivalry) and to reflect upon the continuing histories of art, culture, educational and campaigning organisations (such as Woodcraft Folk) who share common roots. Through engagements with a range of public archives and project partners - including Museum of London, London School of Economics and Whitechapel Gallery - and through the development of research relationships with key stakeholders such as the Kibbo Kift Foundation, Woodcraft Folk and current and former woodcraft movement members, a range of previously unseen and underused resources have been interpreted and disseminated through a series of events and major outputs, including a sole-authored book, a co-curated exhibition and a collectively edited publication. I have delivered - and exceeded - all of the projected outcomes and engagement events predicted. 
The most significant aspects of the project include the exhibition and publication, which both reached wide audiences, of all ages and backgrounds, and attracted high-profile publicity across specialist and popular media. The knock-on effect of these public outcomes led to regular and highly diverse invitations to speak at events which led to engagement with a much broader range of audiences than I had originally anticipated. As a result the project opened up new routes for enquiry and analysis, including related cultural projects and organisations of whom I had previously not been aware. The archives and contacts accessed through these organisations has provided richer context and consolidation for my planned research, and has also informed newer work that will develop beyond the life of the award. Another significant aspect of the funded project has been the range of creative responses that the research has prompted in a range of media, across Europe and beyond. These have led to further invitations to collaborate including on moving image and film projects, which had not been predicted. A further significant aspect of the research has been the recognition given in the form of national and international awards (from The Elephant Trust, founded by Lee Miller and Roland Penrose, and by the Swiss Federal Office of Culture).
The collaborations that developed as a result of aligning aspects of my research with a parallel award for a community-based history project (90 Years of Woodcraft Folk, funded in 2015-16 by Heritage Lottery Fund) meant that my modest ambitions for oral history interviews have been enormously expanded; through assisting in the provision of training two dozen members of the public in historical methods, and advising on the direction and delivery of the HLF project overall, together the AHRC and HLF projects were able to execute more than 45 oral history life story interviews (rather than the 12 that I had planned to create alone). The production of this large-scale and high-quality resource suggests further new directions for future research, and current projects include locating a PhD student to research and interpret this collection. The relationships built through this collaboration continue in new forms and working groups that follow on from both awards.
The project continues to develop after the life of the research period, and further book chapters, journal articles and public talks will be forthcoming in 2017 and 2018. Two significant cultural spin-offs are in the planning and further funding applications are planned to develop creative and educational applications of the research.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The publications, public events, exhibition, book and oral history recordings suggest a range of uses by researchers and practitioners interested and / or involved in grassroots organisations, youth movements, alternative education and spirituality, as well as in the art and culture of life reform. The early green politics of the founders of the British woodcraft movement, and the creation of alternatives to industrialised living, has led to interest from a diverse groups, including nature writers, environmental campaign groups, pagans and sceptics, youth and educational groups, artists and makers, musicians and filmmakers, and those living experimental lifestyles in the present day. For these domains, my research has uncovered little-known intellectual and practical pre-histories, provided inspiration for contemporary practice, and suggested new directions for future developments.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>46F92695-E334-4640-9A96-BAEFC4A99432</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d4920e3a5a85.37559035</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Education,Environment,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Retail</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://arts.brighton.ac.uk/projects/woodcraftfolk</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AF0F8EFA-9D51-4ED1-A3C3-14F81BE56D7F</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Kindred of the Kibbo Kift</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Fortean Times: The World of Strange Phenomena</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/07e1be52161eb11d2651a4a419633620"><gtr:id>07e1be52161eb11d2651a4a419633620</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pollen, A.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56d3594001bd40.60047249</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9738D7C1-03F4-47B5-8838-8D2BA3840EA7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Histories of the Future: Crafting Alternatives</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Research News</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/07e1be52161eb11d2651a4a419633620"><gtr:id>07e1be52161eb11d2651a4a419633620</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pollen, A.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c30b3fbbc895.88745092</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>FC0482C2-AA91-48E5-B9A8-5680330EB8F4</gtr:id><gtr:title>A society of ugly people is an immoral society: Bodily beauty in the Kindred of the Kibbo Kift</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Vestoj: The Journal of Sartorial Matters</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/07e1be52161eb11d2651a4a419633620"><gtr:id>07e1be52161eb11d2651a4a419633620</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pollen, A.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56d35a2d3251b2.01637915</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0FE07253-4C39-4BD9-9908-AE6AB93C17C1</gtr:id><gtr:title>Utopia - The Avant-Garde, Modernism and (Im)possible Life</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/fef20e42c9821cb7e803c91a4aed7593"><gtr:id>fef20e42c9821cb7e803c91a4aed7593</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pollen A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-3-11-042709-7</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>56d3543d5665d7.91180925</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B5A079DF-39EE-4068-A777-57B55D02CDED</gtr:id><gtr:title>Ritual, Craft and Camping: An interview with Annebella Pollen</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Maker Assembly</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e3492777122402fabfac4b07e90e48b7"><gtr:id>e3492777122402fabfac4b07e90e48b7</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pollen A.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58b9d4f7981232.51227396</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F46EC437-7287-4A15-BE1F-14793B6C665F</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Sartorial Rebirth of Man?
