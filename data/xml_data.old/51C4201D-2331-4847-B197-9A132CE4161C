Insects are our major competitors for food resources, vectors of disease, but yet are vital as pollinators. Crustaceans are immensely important high value food resources. The success of arthropods is due in part to their amazing plasticity in growth. This involves periodic shedding (ecdysis) of the cuticle, controlled by a complex interplay of hormones. Whilst we know much about the roles of many of the key peptide hormones and their signalling pathways (receptors) involved in ecdysis in insects, much less is known about these in crustaceans. Since insects and crustaceans evolved from a common ancestor over 500 million years ago, their molting endocrinology involves some of the most highly evolved integrative processes, yet show commonality despite their divergence and contrasting life histories! This project will seek to find the common (and unique) endocrine mechanisms involved in ecdysis in crustaceans by pioneering recent fundamental advances in molecular techniques. Using a variety of state-of-the-art technologies, we will unravel the complexities of the hormonal control of crustacean molting (in a crab model). 

 We will identify novel hormones and their putative receptors, using next generation sequencing technologies, and bioinformatics. In this way we can find the crustacean equivalents of insect peptide hormones and their receptors and identify changes in their expression during the molt cycle.
 We will identify neuropeptide receptors using novel technologies in which we transfer the genes that express the receptors into genetically engineered cells that, when exposed to hormone, produce bioluminescent light. Thus we can functionally identify the correct hormone with its receptor.
 We will identify the neurones in the crab nervous system, which express peptide receptors, and link this to the anatomy peptide producing neurones. This work will allow us to piece together the &amp;quot;neural networks&amp;quot; involved in the various behavioural events involved in molting. 
 We will measure hormone levels during ecdysis using ultrasensitive assays.This will give us a unique insight into the various &amp;quot;hormone cascades&amp;quot;, each lasting a few minutes, that are vital in allowing progression and behavioural repertoires of the various stages of ecdysis.
 We will manipulate the hormonal cascade, silencing genes by RNA interference (RNAi). We can thus target each process, given the information on the identity of the hormones and receptors we have identified, and answer the critical question: Can we change specific behaviours such as emergence from the old shell, water uptake during ecdysis, cuticle hardening by using these techniques? What then happens to the expression of others? 
 One of the key hormones involved in crustacean molting is one that inhibits this process (moult-inhibiting hormone, MIH). The receptor for MIH is unknown, and this endocrine system is unique to crustaceans. Thus, understanding the signalling system is of great importance. We will approach this problem in a novel way, using a strategy to identify the receptor by using next generation sequencing and bioinformatics, and then proving functionality in the bioluminescent cell assay.

The research described here will answer one of the outstanding questions in arthropod endocrinology. How do the precisely timed series of hormonal cascades orchestrate successful ecdysis?- a process that has &amp;quot;zero tolerance&amp;quot; to variability, but is nevertheless inordinately successful! The research has impact in aquaculture. We must improve yields of farmed crustaceans (shrimp, crab) to ensure global food security, yet mortality during molting results in tremendous losses (10% per molt) If we can understand the hormonal basis of the ecdysis cascade, caused by inadequate husbandry, culture and transport, we have a first step to wards redressing these problems.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The hormone cascades leading to execution of stepwise orchestrated behaviours culminating in ecdysis in insects have been the subject of intense and fruitful research in the past few years, not least for genetically tractable models. However, for crustaceans, much less is known. Our research programme will address this issue, uncovering both common and unique mechanisms involved in ecdysis in our crab model, Carcinus maenas. We will firstly discover the wide array of peptide hormone and GPCR receptor transcripts involved by using RNAseq technologies to produce neurotranscriptomes at several stages of the molt cycle. Thus we will discover and measure expression levels of many candidates in a global context. Functional identification of these, will build upon what is known for homologous systems in insects. To identify, and deorphanize receptor ligand pairs, we will use well-proven aequorin reporter assays in which cloned candidate GPCRs signal through a promiscuous Galpha subunit. Peptidergic neurones and networks that are organisers of the endocrine cascade will be identified, together with the receptors for the command peptides that initiate ecdysis using immunochemistry and in-situ hybridization. We will couple these results with precise measurement of peptide hormone cascades at a very fine temporal scale. These findings will lead to novel functional studies on selected neuropeptides and receptors, performed via systemic RNAi to determine disrupted phenotypes (transcript, hormone and behavioural/phenotype). Finally we will attempt to contrast conserved neuropeptide/receptor hierarchies involved in ecdysis in athropods with that of a regulatory system unique to crustacaceans, the molt-inhibiting hormone (MIH) and will answer a long-standing question in crustacean endocrinology by identifying and deorphanizing the cognate receptor for the first time, using a combination of NGS, bioinformatics and functional receptor screening in the aequorin assay.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research questions posed in this proposal are firstly of major interest to academic groupings in Biological Sciences. For invertebrate endocrinologists and neuroscientists, our state-of-the art approaches to answering fundamental questions related to arthropod physiology, neuroendocrinology and endocrine homeostasis, will have considerable impact. We are we making a bold attempt to unify arthropod endocrinology, which will be of broad interest to evolutionary biologists. By unravelling core mechanisms involved in ecdysis, we are trying to answer a big question that impacts on quite a number of issues that involve every aspect of arthropod physiology and development. Thus, we have every confidence that our studies will, in the near future, appear in biology textbooks. We will disseminate our findings by publishing primary papers and reviews in high impact journals, presenting our work at national and international meetings. We anticipate that the proposed work will lead to up to 6 high-quality, primary research papers.
Crustaceans, and insects are (in their own way) immensely charismatic animals. Crustacean ecdysis and insect eclosion are fascinating behaviours that capture the imagination of young and old alike. Our findings will be of general interest to the public, and we have planned a vigorous, far reaching and enthusiastic series of activities (Pathways to Impact) to ensure that we maximise public exposure to our research. Both DCW and SGW are passionate about public engagement, and have recently had extensive media coverage. To summarise; we will engage public interest by taking advantage of all available opportunities.
Relevance and impact to industry. The proposed work has direct impact upon crustacean aquaculture. There are two major issues for which our work will be relevant. Firstly, in the broadest sense, since we know relatively little regarding endocrine mechanisms involved in growth and reproduction in crustaceans, our findings will be important in future (technologically driven) aquaculture. More topically, and of immediate relevance, our research deals with endocrine cascades during ecdysis. At this time (preparation for, and execution of ecdysis), there are substantial losses in aquaculture. Soft-shell crab fisheries in the USA (Blue crab, Callinectes sapidus) suffer quite enormous losses from stress-related mortality in captive crabs prior to marketing. Apropos this, we should highlight welfare issues in transported crustaceans. It is not generally appreciated that almost all live crustaceans undergo extensive periods of transport, often between continents. These animals invariably become tremendously stressed, and experience severe hypoxic episodes, with high mortality. Since our research exactly involves the neurohormones involved in adaptation to stressful episodes, and use of technologies developed in the research programme (for example measurement of neurohormone levels in experiments designed to reduce transport stress) our findings will be relevant to animal welfare.
The research programme involves collaboration with scientists at FERA, (cell-based aequorin receptor assays). This group investigates rational design of potential peptide mimetic pesticides, hence their interest in receptor/ligand interactions on economically important insect pests. Since, the central driver of our research programme is to unify peptide signalling systems involved in arthropod ecdysis, there is a potential possibility that our respective research programmes will interact synergistically. 
Training opportunities. The research programme proposed here offers superb training opportunities in data driven research (bioinformatics, NGS technologies), state of the art molecular techniques, that are in our experience, in short supply in the UK. Thus, the impact of this research is direct in that it has the immediate potential of increasing UK competitiveness in Biosciences research.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>254895</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>130000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:department>Institute of Biological Environmental and Rural Sciences (IBERS)</gtr:department><gtr:description>Capital Equipment Bid (BBSRC Year End funds)</gtr:description><gtr:end>2015-03-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>University of Wales</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>5D8CC54C-C988-4A8A-8807-EF49C8601033</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5460d179f17fd5.92986218</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-04-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This grant was awarded as a joint application between Aberystwyth (Wilcockson) and Professor Simon Webster (Bangor, UK). Work-packages detailed in the original application were dedicated to each partner institute and because the project is still ongoing I will briefly outline progress to date resulting from work conducted at Aberystwyth. On completion of the project we will assemble all output for a final report in subsequent Research Fish submissions.

WP1. Identification and quantification of peptide receptor expression during defined stages of the moult cycle by NGS and in silico prediction.
Our working hypothesis for the grant was that insects and crustaceans should share commonalties in the endocrine control of moulting, except in the regulation of the moulting hormone, ecdysone (see below). To test this hypothesis we set out to define the neuropeptide and G-protein coupled receptor complement of crabs throughout the moult cycle and to define their functionality for comparison with insect systems. Thus this WP was integral to the success of all other WPs associated with this project in that it provides gene transcript sequence data for neuropeptide and G-protein coupled receptor discovery and their temporal quantification. 

To date we have used Illumina HiSeq2500 sequencing to generate stage specific transcriptomes for the CNS, epidermis and Y-organ (n=5 per moult stage) from a total of over 1.2 billion raw reads! Complementary DNA libraries were indexed, pooled for sequencing and later de-convoluted in silico. The resulting transcriptomes have enabled us to identify a comprehensive suite of neuropeptide precursors from the nervous tissues, including all those anticipated from comparison with insect models. In summary we have revealed over 400k transcripts, 72 of which are putative neuropeptides, including eclosion hormone-like peptides, eclosion triggering hormones, various diuretic hormones (DH31 and DH44), kinins, adipokinetic hormone orthologs (RPCH), corazonin, adipokinetic-corazonin like peptides etc. Moreover, we have defined the expression profiles of neural transcripts. Our dat indicate that the majority of these are constitutively expressed but we have identified differential expression of 4 unique neuropeptide sequences over the moult cycle (N=5), one of which is a homolog of insect ETH; we are now targeting ETH along with some other likely candidates (such as EH, corazonin and corazonin receptor) for RNAi studies (below). Validation of our NGS expression data by quantitative PCR gave identical results, lending further confidence in out informatics approaches; our superb post-doc Drew Oliphant has done a tremendous amount of work to ensure all NGS data are exceptionally robust and has considered all the latest informatics developments as well as evaluating these new approaches applied to our type of analyses. 

We have used these transcriptomics data to generate tools essential for deep exploration of the ecdysis endocrine cascade in our chosen model. For instance we have synthesized peptides of interest for immunoassay development and antisera and in-situ probes for use in histology/in situ hybridization to describe the localization of these neuropeptides (reported by Bangor). 
Critically, we have also identified cognate receptors for a number of these neuropeptides. It should be noted that until the start of this project not one single crustacean GPCR had been functionally identified. Happily, the NGS transcript data has been used to enable the functional characterization of more than 5 GPCRs in a bioluminescence (aequorin) CHO cell-based based reporter system (reported by Bangor). Thus, our NGS approach has been wholly successful and we now continue to pursue the function of identified peptides that are homologous to those known for insect ecdysis, in crab moulting (see blow). In summary, the sequencing aspect of this grant has been delivered on and exceeded. In due course we will release al the transcriptome data to NCBI for the benefit of other researchers.

WP5. Identification and functional analysis of peptide hormone receptors unique to crustaceans- the MIH receptor.
In arthropods the development of a new cuticle and the moulting process is dependent on ecdysteroids such as 20-OH ecdysone. The defining difference between insect and crustacean growth and development is the neuroendocrine regulation of ecdysteroid synthesis. In insects, ecdysteroid synethsis occurs in the prothoracic glands and is stimulated by prothoracicotropic hormone, synthesized in the brain. In stark contrast, crustacean steroidogenesis in the Y-organs, is under inhibitory control by moult-inhibiting hormone, released from the eyestalks. In order to 'close the loop' on the MIH pathways we still need to define the receptor, which is thought to be a GPCR. Given that the YO is derived form the epidermis we have used an in silico subtraction of YO from epidermis transcripts to identify candidate GPCRs unique to the YO and therefore potential MIH receptors. To date we have identified seven transcripts that code for GPCRs that are expressed only in the YOs and we have de-orphanised one of these GPCRs as a corazonin receptor (Bangor). This finding was entirely unexpected and has opened another intriguing avenue that we are currently exploring- what is the role of CRZ in moult control in crabs? We continue to apply our YO specific GPCRs to the aequorin assay to de-orphanise them and we are confident that we will achieve the functional characterization of the MIHR in the term of this grant.


WP4- Function of peptide hormones and cognate ligands: RNAi-based studies.
Integral to the principle aims of this project is the identification of functions for the neuropeptides and receptors we have identified. Given the intractable nature of crabs from a genome editing/transgenic perspective we aim to suppress mRNA expression using dsRNAi approaches. At the time of writing we have synthesized large quantities of dsRNA for corazonin receptor and eclosion hormone. We will test the effect of injecting these constructs into the haemolymph of crabs imminently.

We are currently drafting three manuscripts from this work for publication later in 2017 and envisage at least one further manuscript thereafter.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Nothing further to report at present.
