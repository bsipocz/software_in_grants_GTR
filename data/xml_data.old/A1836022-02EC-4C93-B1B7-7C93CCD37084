These villages are developed informally but provide a valuable source of affordable housing to the low-income population. Many villages in rural areas are affected by the process of urbanization. The transition from a rural village to an urban residential area is in fact a dynamic process. Depending upon their location, these villages present a full spectrum from rural to urban settlements. While our previous research focuses on peri-urban areas, there is an emerging opportunity to examine villages in the urban and rural environments. Related to this research, we are witnessing some concurrent changes in urban policies in rural settlement redevelopment. Jiangsu province is implementing a village improvement programme that adopts an incremental regeneration approach, while Guangdong province has promulgated the renewal of old urban areas, villages and factories (so-called 'three olds renewal', sanjiu gaizao). This impact and engagement project will select one village from Jiangsu and one from Guangdong to benchmark the practice of village improvement with our principle of in situ regeneration and present them as a demonstration project so as to fully develop the potential of sustainable urban regeneration in Chinese cities as well as cities in the Global South. As our original research project provided evidence-based social science research to demonstrate the imperative of in situ regeneration, this project supports 'research uptake' to translate the research findings and principles into a more prescriptive policy instrument. Towards this end, we will develop a village improvement toolkit, with concrete examples from these two pilot villages. The toolkit will explore in detail the critical elements - land, capital and residents - in realising sustainable redevelopment. This approach will benefit the poor and extend some viable local practices which are being demonstrated in China today. While policy practices are context-sensitive and might not be transferable, the research impacts generated here will present new possibilities for cross-fertilizing the experience of the Global South. To facilitate cross-country learning, the project will organize an impact workshop in London with the participation of policy users from Jiangsu and Guangdong as well as national policy research institute and professional planning organisations. Potential users from international development communities will also be invited to participate. The project will maintain a website to accommodate a photo archive of these pilot projects and a manual for pro-poor regeneration to enhance research impacts. The project aims to collect the best practices in the two major provinces to explore their potential for developing a new pathway to urbanization in China. There is an emerging opportunity for extending the impact to wider national practices, as China has adopted 'new styles of urbanization' as its national development strategy.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project aims to enhance impacts on China's urban policies, especially on urban regeneration and village improvement. Concurring with our previous findings on the value of villages in the urbanized areas for rural migrants and advocacy for an incremental approach to urban regeneration, Jiangsu province and Guangdong province have initiated respectively a 'village improvement programme' and a scheme of 'redevelopment of old factories, villages and urban areas'. Based on our research projects, we have good working relationships with these policy users. Our research team has organised training courses in the UK for senior planners from these two provinces. The Chinese central government is striving to promote 'people-oriented urbanization' as a new growth strategy but little is known about the concrete pathway to its implementation. Moreover, Chinese practices of urban redevelopment may provide an interesting example for other countries in the Global South. In response to these emerging opportunities to generate impacts on Chinese urbanization policies and enhance learning in the Global South, this project facilitates research uptake by comparing and benchmarking village regeneration programmes in two provinces and extending our research findings into implementable policy recommendations. The project emphasizes knowledge co-production between research and policy-makers in the Global South, through up-scaling local practices into a regeneration model. The beneficiaries of this project are firstly policy makers in the Department of Construction of Jiangsu province and the Department of Housing and Urban-Rural Development of Guangdong province, professional planners and their organisations (the two provincial Institutes of Urban Planning and Design), and secondly non-government and international organisations that are interested in the development of informal settlements (for example, UN-Habitat). Through two workshops in Nanjing and Guangzhou (November 2015) co-organized with local policy and planning institutes, the project aims to provide concrete recommendations for village regeneration, which will turn our previous findings into implementable planning principles. The outcome may influence Chinese professional organizations and policy makers at the national level (for example, the China Academy of Urban Planning and Design under the Ministry of Housing, Rural and Urban Development, MOHURD, and the China Centre for Urban Development under the National Development and Reform Commission, NDRC). The project plans to organise a final workshop in London (March 2016) to disseminate Chinese practices synthesized from these two previous workshops to an international audience and facilitate the engagement of policy users and development planning, including, for example, the International Society of City and Regional Planners, ISOCARP).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>58801</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The project team has completed a series of impact initiatives to achieve the objectives of this project. The workshop with the Department of Housing and Urban-Rural Development (DHURD) of Guangdong and Jiangsu was attended by key decision makers including the Deputy General Ying Cai of DHURD (Guangdong) and senior planners from Shenzhen and Guangzhou planning department. For the Jiangsu department, we invited Zhou Lan, Director of DHURD and Xiaohui Chen, the Deputy Director of Jiangsu Urbanisation and Urban Rural Planning Research Centre and other senior planners from Jiangsu DHURD. The workshop in Guangzhou invited planning officials including the director of Shaoguan city's planning department (Xianfeng Xu) and senior planners from Dongguan's planning authority.

Furthermore, Wu was invited to present at two high profile conferences, which were attended by central and municipal policy makers as well as planning professionals. The Rural Construction and Management Forum in Beijing was jointly organised by Ministry of Housing and Urban and Rural Development (MOHURD) and the China Academy of Urban Planning and Design (CAUPD) and was attended by key decision makers including the Deputy Head of Central Rural Work Leading Group and Director of the Office of Central Rural Work Leading Group (Chen Xiwen) and the Director of the Department of Village and Township Construction, MOHURD (Zhao Hui) amongst others. The annual conference of the Urban-Rural Governance and Policy Research Committee took place in Nanjing and was co-organised by Nanjing University and the Urban Planning Society of China.

The final impact workshop facilitated inter-provincial learning between Jiangsu (Xiaohui Chen) and Guangdong (Ying Cao representing Ying Cai, the deputy general of Guangdong's DHURD). By inviting key decision makers from CAUPD (Kai Wang, Vice President) and the Urban Planning Institution of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) (Chi Shen, Director and Chief Planner of China Centre for Urban Development) it was also possible to connect province level planning practices with the central government's policy agenda. Leading experts from international development organisations were also invited including the IIED (David Satterthwaite, Senior Fellow), ISOCARP (Martin Dubbeling, Vice president), UN-Habitat (Xingquan Zhang, Senior Advisor), OECD (Rudiger Ahrend, Head of Urban Programme) and RTPI (Michael Harris, Deputy Head of Policy and Research).

A website has been created for wider public dissemination of the project findings including village redevelopment cases from Guangdong and Jiangsu as well as the sustainable urban and rural village regeneration toolkit (see https://urban-china.org). The regeneration toolkit has also been distributed to Chinese planning partners. 

The project proposes an incremental redevelopment approach based on the case studies from Jiangsu's village improvement program and the 'three old renewals' in Guangdong. The finding that China needs to foster a transition from wholesale to incremental redevelopment has been widely agreed by policy makers and planners in China. Although it is difficult to attribute the change to any specific recommendations of the project, the project does enhance the awareness of alternative urban regeneration approaches. There are some signs that a new generation of redevelopment is becoming more sensitive to the environment, trying to reduce the impacts on original residents. This is partially due to the fact that the wholesale demolition approach is becoming increasingly difficult and causing serious social discontent. In Jiangsu, the village improvement scheme has been widely acclaimed and mainstreamed; in Guangdong, so-called small-scale and easy improvements (weiyi gaizhao) have been initiated. However, because of the recent economic slow-down and the imperative to boost land and housing development, not all redevelopments adopt an incremental approach. The demolition of informal settlements is still a major threat to affordable housing of low-income families. Our project is an initial step to promote the transition towards a more sustainable and inclusive approach to urban regeneration through developing intense interaction with policy makers and professional planners. 

Our research findings have also led to wider interests in international organisations. For example, UN-Habitat in its partner library lists our publication on housing in Chinese urban villages (Wu, 2016, in Housing Studies) (see http://uni.unhabitat.org/shared-materials ). There is a great potential to extend this impact on other cities in the Global South. We have received additional support from the British Academy in 2017 to conduct a project on Chinese informal settlements: rethinking urban futures in the Global South.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>215FA073-7B4D-448F-AA4A-00D2178FA993</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>574aefdf57abf1.14920721</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project examined the scope for adopting an incremental upgrade approach for the redevelopment of Chinese urban villages. Our research revealed that one of the key obstacles preventing an incremental village upgrade is the land-centred development approach currently adopted by Chinese local governments. A related problem is the ambiguous property rights produced by the dual rural-urban land market, which provide the necessary legal framework for the local government to acquire rural land. Given that land-based growth is a key mechanism for municipal authorities to generate revenue, the demolition of urban villages therefore serves this interest by freeing up additional land for development. 

However, the Chinese government also recognises the need for a different regeneration strategy in light of a slowing down of the Chinese economy and the imminent need to accommodate rural migrants. To explore how these obstacles can be overcome, we chose Jiangsu and Guangdong as case studies since both provinces are amongst the most developed regions in China and have been extensively involved in the redevelopment of urban and rural villages. 

The policy initiative of 'Three Old Renewal' in Guangdong effectively solves the issue of ambiguous property rights and large-scale public investment required for the redevelopment of urban villages by allowing village landowners to directly collaborate with the private market. The downside is that if landowners and private developers are given free reign (as is the case in Guangdong), urban villages are still completely demolished in order to construct housing targeted at the real estate market. Therefore, rural migrants and other low-income residents of urban villages still face displacement. 

In contrast, the 'Village Improvement Program' in Jiangsu has adopted an in-situ village upgrade strategy in rural areas thereby allowing existing residents to stay and participate in the upgrade. The program has improved the living environment and basic infrastructure of the rural villages without needing to displace its residents. The downside however, is that the government still needs to commit a considerable amount of fund to the improvement of these villages. Furthermore, the in-situ approach is only implemented in the villages outside the main urban areas. 

Through comparing the strengths and weaknesses of these two redevelopment approaches, we prepared a regeneration toolkit which recommends a combination of the Guangdong and Jiangsu redevelopment models and a rearrangement of the governance structure of urban village redevelopments.

With respect to financing the village redevelopment, the village collectives who are the landowners should be given the power to lead the upgrade of their villages. Similar to the 'Three Old Renewal' policy in Guangdong, villagers can collaborate with the developer to fund the upgrade. On the other hand, following the incremental approach of village improvement in Jiangsu, the application of in-situ improvements can be extended from the rural villages to 'urban villages' that are at a distance to the urban area. This would also allow greater potential to self-fund the redevelopment project. To ensure the continued affordability and avoid displacement of tenants in rental housing, municipal governments should require the redevelopment to maintain a mix of housing tenure, in addition to imposing basic health and safety regulations.

Finally, China's capacity to redevelop informal settlements is due to both the strong organisational ability of the state (in Jiangsu's case) and of the rural collectives (in Guangdong's case). Therefore, China's village redevelopment can potentially provide some lessons for other Global South countries that have so far not been able to improve the living environment of informal settlements.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We expect our work to:
