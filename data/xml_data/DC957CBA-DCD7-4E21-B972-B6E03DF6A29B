materials</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/M012247/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Increasing energy cost, heavy legislative pressures, consumer's demand for environmental friendlier products, carbon neutral technologies and a sustainable future have all triggered fresh interest in research and development of green(er) materials. In this context, cellulose nanofibres are regarded as the prime candidate for the production of high performance sustainable composites. However, the high tensile stiffness (up to 160 GPa) and strength (at least 1 GPa) of a single cellulose nanofibre has yet to be fully exploited in composite materials. Numerous researchers have already manufactured bacterial cellulose (BC)- or nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC)-reinforced polymer composites. Whilst these studies showed the ability of nanocellulose to improve the mechanical performance of polymer matrices, many of these nanocomposites still performed worse than or only equally well compared to PLA, which is one of the highest performing bio-derived polymers that is commercially available at a reasonable price. 

This proposed project aims to develop the next generation of nanocellulose-reinforced polymers applying green engineering principles to reduce the use of solvents and energy, as well as introduce simple manufacturing concepts to produce sustainable nanocomposites that are truly high performance for high volume structural applications. To achieve this, this project will concentrate on the use of: (i) ultra-low grammage or (ii) high performance cellulose &amp;quot;nanopapers&amp;quot; as the building blocks for sustainable composite materials. It can be anticipated that such truly green and high performance nanofibre composites will find wider applications for instance in the composite, plastic electronics and flexible display industries.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The main beneficiaries of the proposed research will be the academic engineering science community and the UK/EU engineering, as well as industrial manufacturing base throughout the value chain, from materials suppliers to end users. The concepts explored in this proposed project are of fundamental interest to various industries including the composites and pulp and paper industries. A recent report by the Royal Society, &amp;quot;The Scientific Century&amp;quot; makes six recommendations around the long-term support and investment in science, including (i) put science and innovation at the heart for a strategy for long-term economic growth; (ii) prioritise investment in excellent people; (iii) strengthen government's use of science; (iv) reinforce the UK's position as a hub for global science and innovation; (v) better align science and innovation with global challenges, (vi) revitalise science and mathematics education. This project will focus on most, or if not all of these recommendations. As the manufacturing technology described in this project is as simple as making paper, it is cost-effective and easily scalable. This particular attribute appeals to UK's manufacturing industry, particularly the small and medium enterprises which do not have large amount of starting investment in manufacturing equipment. The know-how of nanopaper manufacturing and design procedures developed throughout the course of this project will be applicable to the area of materials engineering and technology, as well as fabrication of nanostructured materials. Whilst the current price for nanocellulose is still rather high, the successful outcome of this project will aid the commercialisation of nanocellulose products, where its relatively high cost can be justified by materials performance. Furthermore, this project will have major educational outcomes; it will provide research experience in novel manufacturing methods, materials testing and characterisation techniques, training in methodology and transferable skills for researchers working in complementary research areas. The successful funding of this project will train and educate the next generation of researchers in the area of composites manufacturing, in line with UK's composites strategy. Since this research is conducted in a university environment, the undergraduates will be exposed to materials driven research in a chemical engineering setting. The consumer and the wider society will also benefit as a whole, as the outcome of this project will include, for example, more environmentally friendlier materials through the use of greener starting materials, simpler manufacturing methods and reduced materials usage. The materials manufactured throughout this project will depend on the outcome but likely to provide an alternative to glass fibre-reinforced composites. Moreover, these materials also have the potential for reduced through-life cost, which the end users demand. To maximise the impact of the proposed project, the benefits of this research will be publicised to a much broader audience, capatilising on our societal needs for environmental friendly materials. Results will be disseminated at various international conferences and peer-reviewed publications. Where appropriate, commercially relevant materials will be protected by patent applications, which may be licensed or spun-out through UCL Business, the exploitation arm of UCL. A dedicated website will also be set up to further disseminate the outcome of this project to target the relatively narrow confines of academia. Here, UK and EU policy makers will have the chance to review, investigate and come up with new policies to drive the direction of sustainable composite materials.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-01-25</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-26</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>96864</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University College London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Chemical Engineering</gtr:department><gtr:description>LCA of composite materials</gtr:description><gtr:id>FAA822C9-D93B-49F3-9878-7503F113EF56</gtr:id><gtr:impact>'Green' composites using nanocellulose as reinforcement promise a sustainable and renewable alternative to petroleum-based plastics. However, no studies have yet been done to compare the green credentials of nanocellulose-reinforced composites against commercially available and widely used bio-based polymers (polylactide) and composites (glass fibre-reinforced polypropylene). Our study showed that nanocellulose (both bacterial cellulose and wood-derived nanofibrillated cellulose) reinforced epoxy composites might not be as green as initially thought. This was attributed to the energy consumption of deriving the raw materials for the biosynthesis of bacterial cellulose. In the case of wood-derived nanofibrillated cellulose, it is attributed to the energy consumption of grinding wood fibres into nanoscale cellulosic fibres. In addition to this, the manufacturing process of nanocellulose-reinforced epoxy utilising vacuum assisted resin infusion also places heavy environmental burden as various consumables are required for the process. Nevertheless, the green credentials of nanocellulose-reinforced epoxy composites can be improved by producing nanocellulose-reinforced epoxy composites with better mechanical performance that will utilise the high tensile stiffness and strength of single nanocellulsoe fibres.

In this collaboration, we elucidated the influence of test specimen geometries on the measured tensile properties of plant-derived cellulose nanofibres (CNF) and microbially synthesised bacterial cellulose (BC) nanopapers. Four test specimen geometries were studied: (i) miniaturised dog bone specimen with 2 mm width, (ii) miniaturised rectangular specimen with 5 mm width, (iii) standard dog bone specimen with 5 mm width and (iv) standard rectangular specimen with 15 mm width. It was found that the tensile moduli of both CNF and BC nanopapers were not significantly influenced by the test specimen geometries if an independent strain measurement system (video extensometer) was employed. The average tensile strength of the cellulose nanopapers is also influenced by test specimen geometries. It was observed that the smaller the test specimen width, the higher the average tensile strength of the cellulose nanopapers. This can be described by the weakest link theory, whereby the probability of defects present in the cellulose nanopapers increases with increasing test specimen width. This collaboration pave way towards a more standardised test methods for cellulose nanopapers. 

This is a multidisciplinary collaboration with Imperial College as the lead in mechanics of nanofibre network (can be considered a branch of materials science) and VTT leads the plant-derived nanocellulose manufacturing and characterisations (wood chemistry).

This workshop was co-organised by Imperial College London (Dr Koon-Yang Lee), Institute of Materials Chemistry and Research (Prof Alexander BIsmarck, Dr Andreas Mautner), University of Manchester (Dr Jonny Blaker) and Aalto University (Prof Eero Kontturi). This workshop has attracted more than 80 participants from 20 different universities, research institutions and industries. Unlike conventional conference and workshops, whereby every attendees present their latest research, we have decided to take a different approach and organised the workshop into 4 different forums:

Professor Forum
Throughout a researcher's career, numerous ideas have been tested but many did not hold their promise. In our workshop, the Professors who have been actively working in the area of nanocellulose discussing not only the latest scientific achievements but also what had been achieved, as well as what research ideas had been tried out but did not make it to publications.
Young Academic Forum
In most conferences, young academics are reluctant to participate in the discussion. We believe that young and younger academics should participate in discussion as they are the next generation of researchers to lead the field. To promote this, the Young Academic Forum is a forum solely run by young researchers, including session chairing, time keeping and encouraging Q&amp;amp;A amongst the audience. This exposes young researchers and promote active knowledge transfer between researchers from various institutes.
Editor Forum
In the Editor Forum, we invited a panel of journal editors to discuss what do they look for in a manuscript before sending it out for review. This forum decypher the science behind editorial decisions, such as what do journal editors look for in the first instance, running manuscripts through plagarism software and what type of manuscript warrants a straight out rejection.
Knowledge Transfer Forum
We have experts from Anton Paar, Kr&amp;uuml;ss and SMS providing an introduction to the theory behind the methods, tips &amp;amp; tricks in measuring and interpreting the surface properties of nanocellulose. Participants will also have the chance to experience these techniques hands-on. An event that is useful for all researchers.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d05857ad3d82.23282633</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.imperial.ac.uk/materials-and-sustainability/impact-and-public-engagement/round-table-of-ideas---nanocellulose-2015/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Giving a seminar at the University of Exeter</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6D820589-DD09-42C8-849E-D07FB8C4B2CE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I was invited to give a talk on the research outcome of this EPSRC grant.

This has led to a journal article publication (CSTE 2015, 118, 154), as well as a web publication about this work (http://www.materialstoday.com/composites/news/how-green-are-celluose-reinforced-composites/). 

Some of the findings from this grant has been picked up by the scientific magazine, Impact, which is an open access scientific report.

However, our study showed that nanocellulose-reinforced polymer composites might not be as green as initially thought as numerous waste are generated during the production of nanocellulose (both bacterial cellulose and wood-derived nanofibrillated cellulose), consumables used during composite manufacturing and the end of life of these composites. 

We have also found that there is currently no standardised test methods for evaluating the tensile properties of nanocellulose network (also known as cellulose nanopapers). With the funding of this grant, we have shown that the measured tensile properties of cellulose nanopapers is highly dependent on the test specimen geometries used. In addition to this, our work also elucidated the importance of an independent strain measurement system (e.g. a non-contact video extensometer) to evaluate the Young's modulus of these cellulose nanopapers. We also develop (one of the first) fracture resistance test of cellulose nanopapers. 

With these standardised test method, we have now shown that it is possible to produce high performance cellulose nanopapers, which can be used directly as the reinforcement for polymer in a laminated architecture to produce truly sustainable and high performance composites. In addition to this, we have also shown that we could reduce the grammage of these cellulose nanopapers (to 5 gsm) and use these ultra-low grammage cellulose nanopapapers as reinforcement for polymers in a laminated architecture. Whilst the final composite properties reinforced with these ultra-low grammage nanoappers did not differ much compared to high grammage (60 gsm) nanopaper-reinofrced polymers, the use of ultra-low grammage nanopapers as the reinforcement has the advantage of reduced production time. 

We have also shown that highly porous cellulose nanopapers can be produced by changing the dispersing medium for the nanocellulose prior to nanopaper production. With such porous nanocellulose network, we showed that these network can be impregnated at a single fibre level to fully exploited the high tensile stiffness and strength of a single cellulose nanofibre.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We think that the green credentials of nanocellulose-reinforced composites will now be taken into account when discussing about the possibility of producing greener materials from nanocellulose. 

The wider audience will also think about the environmental impact associated with the manufacturing of these composites and hopefully, they will find better manufacturing methods that will place a lighter (or zero) environmental burden.

On the test specimen geometry work, we believe that the nanocellulose community will now use our work as a reference for the tensile testing (and fracture testing) of their manufactured cellulose nanopapers. This is a significant step forward towards a standardised test methods for cellulose nanopapers.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D0318DE2-CD00-4D92-BD57-7CEEBECBD312</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d0615cae5612.79672243</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Environment,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.imperial.ac.uk/future-materials-group/publications/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>This is a data showing (up to the year 2016) the tensile properties of neat nanofibrillated cellulose and bacterial cellulose nanopapers.</gtr:description><gtr:id>96765A99-5960-402A-9823-444A5126A3BF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We found that the tensile properties of these nanopapers vary across research groups, countries and even continents. More importantly from these data, we found that there is no standardised test methods for these cellulose nanopapers. Various test specimen geometries have been used. Some authors used an independent strain measurement for Young's modulus calculation but many of them don't. 

This leads to us to conclude that not all the data published in literature on the tensile properties of cellulose nanopapers are trustworthy. Strain measurement is very important in determining the Young's modulus of any material, which many authors in this field seemed to have ignored. We have published results showing the importance of test specimen geometries and an independent strain measurement on the measured tensile properties of these nanopapers.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bc40a365df22.33096079</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Tensile properties of cellulose nanopapers</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The data collected consist of all the tensile properties of natural fibre-reinforced polymer composites up to the year 2016, published in the journal International Materials Review</gtr:description><gtr:id>97CFB365-EA2F-4BE6-ACDE-AF0C73ED5F6E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We showed in our published article (International Materials Review 2018, http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09506608.2016.1271089) using these data that natural fibre reinforced polymers still cannot compete with glass fibre reinforced polymers.
