But one type which is most widely used by hundreds, from undergraduate students to emeritus staff, is nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The advantage of NMR relies on its versatility and applicability to nearly any kind of material. The NMR of a liquid, mainly a solution of a material in a solvent, is particularly widespread due to the ease of use and the rich information content provided by well-resolved signals. The major problem in NMR, however, is sensitivity: we usually need milligrams of a sample to collect an NMR signal. Sensitivity is measured as a signal-to-noise ratio on a standard sample. One way to improve it is to increase the magnetic field strength. After about 25 years of magnet developments, a saturated state was approached. A breakthrough came in 1999 when the temperature of the probe coil and other parts was dropped drastically giving a &amp;gt;4-fold increase in sensitivity. This translates into a &amp;gt;16-fold reduction in time. The introduction of cryoprobes in NMR can be compared to the implementation of fast processors in computers. The increase in sensitivity means that we can now measure not only 1H or 31P with nearly 100% natural abundance but also 13C or 15N of small amounts of sample.

The main objective of this proposal is to introduce the first broadband cryoprobe at the highest 1H frequency of 700 MHz into a daily research of a diverse range of materials and drugs in Physical and Life sciences. To give a few examples, the new equipment will be used in such studies as the origin of life, drug discovery, cancer research, metabonomics, batteries, polymers and catalysis. The equipment will be installed in UCL, which has a &amp;pound;385M total EPSRC support. It will become part of the existing NMR facility in UCL Chemistry, with 4 solution and 1 solid-state NMRs. The 700 MHz instrument will be the highest field instrument at UCL Chemistry and will underpin both chemical biologyand materials research. 

In recent years, several new appointments have been made, many of which actively use NMR, including Prof Battaglia - the chemistry of biological polymers, Dr Powner - origins of life via chemical pathways leading to biological form and function, multicomponent reactions, sulphur and phosphorus chemistry, Dr Chudasama (named by Forbes magazine as one of the world's top scientists under the age of 30) - novel biotechnology drugs for selective delivery of chemotherapy to tumour cells via combinations with antibodies, Dr Bronstein - conjugated fused aromatic small molecules and polymers for use in optoelectronics. Within a short time, Dr Powner has become our leading NMR user, running &amp;gt;35% of the total number of NMR spectra. His research will gain considerably from the multinuclear and improved signal dispersion capabilities of the new instrument.

In addition to addressing the increased demand within UCL Chemistry, the new equipment will be used by &amp;gt;15 other UCL departments, which have joint EPSRC supported research projects with Chemistry, including Biochemical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Eastman Dental Institute, School of Pharmacy, Wolfson Institute and others.

As this is a unique facility with the first helium-cooled broadband cryoprobe in the UK, the use of the new equipment will be extended to include other UK universities and research institutions in order to address their need in NMR of less studied nuclei. The operation of the facility will be fully automated to provide high throughput. Remote access will also be enabled for users from outside UCL Chemistry.

It is expected that the new facility will provide more comprehensive structural information by expanding NMR to nearly all atoms present in a molecule, not just 1H and 13C. This will enable drawing detailed structure-property relationships, which in turn will enhance our ability to design new advanced materials and drugs with desired properties and functions.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Development of new materials and drugs with desired properties relies on our knowledge of their structure and dynamics. The most versatile technique in this regard is NMR spectroscopy. Applied separately on each type of nucleus present in a material NMR provides much-needed selectivity for structure and dynamics studies, which in turn advances our ability to design new materials and drugs.

The major problem of NMR, however, is its sensitivity, requiring larger quantities of samples than other methods. The objective of this proposal is to establish a 700 MHz NMR facility with a helium-cooled broadband cryoprobe. The proposed facility will be unique in the sense that it will combine multiple cutting-edge NMR technologies into a single all-in-one instrument dedicated to comprehensive studies of materials at the atomistic level. It will provide record levels of sensitivity for NMR measurements enabling experiments considered as unfeasible until recently, such as 19F NMR detections at micromolar concentrations or natural abundance NMR of 15N in the absence of nearby protons.

To our knowledge, there is no such facility in the world, making this instrument unique as multinuclear NMR equipment at the internationally leading level. Therefore, the requested equipment meets national needs by establishing a unique world-leading research activity. As such, it will be available to students and staff from UK academia and industry.

The immediate beneficiaries will include the EPSRC funded projects. Researchers from London and other UK universities will be provided with the full walk-up access to the new facility. In UCL Chemistry alone, the facility will have a direct impact on the research of &amp;gt;20 groups. The highest sensitivity of multinuclear NMR facility combined with fully automated and remote operation will satisfy requests from hundreds of users promptly, expediting wide impact of the facility.

The impact of the proposed facility on fundamental and applied sciences spans Chemistry, Materials Science, Biology, Physics, Medicine, Healthcare, Engineering, Geology and others. The research enabled by the new equipment is relevant to the strategic EPSRC themes:

1. Energy (EP/K014714 &amp;pound;3.7M, EP/N009533 &amp;pound;1.3M, EP/L017091 &amp;pound;840K)
2. Healthcare Technologies (EP/K031953 &amp;pound;11M, EP/M01732X &amp;pound;564K)
3. Manufacturing the Future (EP/L017709 &amp;pound;2.3M, EP/K014897 &amp;pound;1.9M, EP/N01572X &amp;pound;778K)
4. Physical Sciences (EP/K004980 &amp;pound;970K, EP/M02220X &amp;pound;345K)
5. Research Infrastructure (CRUK&amp;amp;EPSRC Cancer Imaging Centre at KCL&amp;amp;UCL)

The new equipment will benefit research falling within the four Grand Challenges of Chemical Sciences and Engineering:

(i) Dial-a-Molecule - 100% efficient synthesis
(ii) Directed Assembly of Extended Structures with Targeted Properties
(iii) Systems Chemistry: Exploring the Chemical Roots of Biological Organisation
(iv) Utilising CO2 in Synthesis and Transforming the Chemicals Industry

The research benefiting from the new facility is also relevant to 2 out of 4 Grand Challenges in Physics:
 
(i) Nanoscale Design of Functional Materials and 
(ii) Understanding the Physics of Life, 

as well as in Healthcare Technologies:

(i) Developing Future Therapies and 
(ii) Optimising Treatment. 

Thus, the new equipment will contribute towards addressing long-term public expectations and industrial needs identified by EPSRC. For example, the amidation reaction by Dr Sheppard will be crucial for direct amide synthesis, the most commonly used reaction in the pharmaceutical industry, which is a sector of huge importance to the UK economy.

The principal and substantial impacts will come from the work done by many groups using the new facility, which will affect lives of broader social groups through developments of, e.g., new batteries, solar panels, drugs and healthcare products. The new facility will also impact research into diagnostics and therapy of such diseases as cancer, liver cirrhosis and multiple sclerosis.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>786999</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>865F1989-4C3C-464B-A344-360A4A073AFF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Tin chemical shift anisotropy in tin dioxide: On ambiguity of CSA asymmetry derived from MAS spectra.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Solid state nuclear magnetic resonance</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d1516780233dc12ffec90ddb9f2a23d4"><gtr:id>d1516780233dc12ffec90ddb9f2a23d4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Aliev AE</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0926-2040</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a9d475479aa82.45528097</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>011B473D-E255-43D8-B111-262DBFB219C9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Noncovalent Interactions of p Systems with Sulfur: The Atomic Chameleon of Molecular Recognition.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/51fb293ba933efe9e5cb3f64e88953be"><gtr:id>51fb293ba933efe9e5cb3f64e88953be</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Motherwell WB</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1433-7851</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a9d4754afb755.12856499</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>68B2739E-787C-4F13-BC6A-926D9B53C41E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Borate esters: Simple catalysts for the sustainable synthesis of complex amides.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Science advances</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5a1cdb72bcffb629a150e9a3c00441db"><gtr:id>5a1cdb72bcffb629a150e9a3c00441db</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Sabatini MT</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2375-2548</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5aa12e1504b291.46170408</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1A06DFD6-5FB6-46F8-8F75-BC876287078B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Protecting-group-free amidation of amino acids using Lewis acid catalysts.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/747b49096f2da583798db1e180b6b333"><gtr:id>747b49096f2da583798db1e180b6b333</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Sabatini M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0947-6539</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5aa1317a26c4d6.08544741</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P020410/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>863FC58A-7217-42EA-B076-663F2D770BB8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical measurement</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>98EA7556-1427-44F9-84F3-BF99B7207302</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Analytical Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
