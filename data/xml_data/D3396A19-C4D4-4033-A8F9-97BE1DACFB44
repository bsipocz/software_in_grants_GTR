The proper organisation of rural communities was central to political and social debates at the turn of the eighteenth century, and featured strongly in 1790s political polemic. It was even a major factor in deliberations about the future direction of Britain's imperial project in the Indian subcontinent. The British were concerned that demographic changes were destabilizing small rural communities, and that this in turn was having a detrimental impact upon trade.\n\nMy previous monograph, Robert Bloomfield, Romanticism and the Poetry of Community (Ashgate, 2007), explores the representation of country people and communities in the work of one poet. My research for this book, based upon my doctoral project, suggested that a more wide-ranging study is long overdue. My current project will focus on a range of primary texts that represent rural communities in different ways. Texts will be drawn from different discourses, and will include works by both canonical writers (Jane Austen, Robert Burns, John Clare and William Wordsworth) and less well-known writers (Robert Bloomfield, George Crabbe and Ebenezer Elliott). Theoretically, my project will be informed by ideas derived from recent study of communitarian social development and organisation. The work of Alasdair MacIntyre, Charles Taylor, Michael Sandel and Michael Walzer theorizes the role of human links and networks in sustaining community structures that can adapt to a changing socio-economic environment. As such it will contribute to my analysis of a selection of primary texts which are primarily concerned with the problem of building sustainable and healthy communities in the countryside. Through its focus on the search for local solutions to what were perceived to be large-scale or national problems of sustainability, my project will be relevant to recent developments in eco-criticism within Romantic studies. It will also link into the ongoing contemporary debate about the make-up and function of rural communities.\n\nMy research will be disseminated through a monograph entitled Romanticism and the Rural Community. The book will begin with an extended introduction which will include a literature review, a re-evaluation of the impact of parliamentary enclosure on rural communities, and a brief summary of the content and argument of each subsequent chapter. The first chapter will examine the relationship between ideas about rural community and political vision in 1790s polemic. The second will offer some revisionary readings of Wordsworth's poetry. For example I will demonstrate that his early poetry is not a straight-forward celebration of the semi-independent cottager, and will read it as a response to the idealisation of the cottager in 1790s polemic. The third chapter will consider George Crabbe's representation of local institutions - churches, schools, prisons, alms houses, clubs, solicitor's offices and medical practitioner's surgeries - in village and small country town communities. The fourth will consider Jane Austen's representation of the way the attitudes of the gentry and pseudo gentry towards working rural communities changed during the first two decades of the nineteenth century. Then there will be a chapter comparing and contrasting the representation of the rural village community in the poetry of Burns, Bloomfield and Clare. The final chapter will consider Ebenezer Elliott's prophetic poem about the transformation of rural villages into dormitories for the commercial and professional middle classes.\n\nThe second outcome will be a half-day symposium / workshop involving academics from a range of disciplines, and representatives of local government and the charity sector. I aim to stimulate debate about whether and how ideas about what rural communities used to be like influences policy and practice today.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>My research will resonate with contemporary concerns about the make-up and purpose of rural communities, so facilitating the establishment of new links and networks that can debate and influence policy and practice today. In particular, I want to focus on the question of whether and how ideas about what rural communities used to be like influence policy and practice within local government and the 'third' sector? I will highlight links with these issues by producing a shorter, more accessible account of my research, and hosting a multi-disciplinary, multi-sector symposium / workshop to coincide with the publication of my monograph. \n\nI will conclude my monograph study with an examination of the work of Ebenezer Elliott; in particular his elegy for the rural working community in The Splendid Village (1833). It is Elliott's awareness that, even by the 1820s, rural villages and communities had changed in fundamental ways that makes his poem so important. His 'splendid village' is similar to the modern commuter or dormitory village for the commercial and professional middle classes. Ordinary working people are driven or priced out of their homes (in Elliott's village the homes of three cottagers make way for one lawyer's house) and, where they remain (whether William Wordsworth's shepherd-heroes or John Clare's rooted poor) they are regarded as a stain upon the village's 'splendid' nature.\n\nThe worry that there are more and more dormitory villages in the countryside informs much of the work of Oxfordshire Rural Community Council (ORCC). I will co-host a half-day symposium with ORCC to stimulate an on-going debate about the question - do ideas about what rural communities used to be like influence the expectations of those who live in rural communities, and shape policy and practice today, and is this a problem. Because the ORCC has a 'bottom-up' approach to community development they will have anecdotal evidence of the way people's expectations are coloured by nostalgia. But a more wide-ranging, and detailed analysis of whether and how the attitudes of those who live in rural communities hinder their stated development objectives will inform ORCC's current and future work. It may be that Elliott was wrong to worry about the dormitory village question in the 1820s and 30s, and ORCC is wrong to worry about it now, but the symposium will explore the issue in a systematic way.\n\nSimilarly the work of the other national and local 'third' sector or charity organisations who will be invited to participate in the symposium - including Oxfordshire Association of Local Councils; Oxfordshire Community and Voluntary Action; Cherwell Community Voluntary Services; the Campaign to Protect Rural England; the Countryside Alliance; Natural England; and the National Housing Federation - should be informed by a better knowledge of how the past can influence attitudes within rural communities in ways that might be counter-productive.\n\nAs local government has a clear role in this at policy level, Oxfordshire County Council and Cherwell District Council will also be invited to participate in this Oxfordshire-focused forum. \n\nI intend to produce various shorter, more accessible accounts of my research in advance of the symposium, highlighting connections with contemporary concern about the make-up and purpose of rural communities, for dissemination to symposium participants, and through ORCC and Brookes websites, and for publication in commercial magazines (Countryman or BBC Countryfile Magazine).\n \nIn more general terms, my work will also enrich the experience of general readers of Wordsworth and Burns, and encourage an interest in less well-known writers, like Crabbe, Bloomfield and especially Elliott, whose work has significant contemporary relevance.

The workshops were attended by local councillors and representatives of local government, representatives of the third sector (including Oxfordshire Association of Local Councils, Oxfordshire Community and Voluntary Action, Cherwell Community Voluntary Services, Natural England, the National Housing Federation and the Women's Institute), and Oxford Brookes University and Oxford Univesity academics from a range of disciplines (including literary studies, history, history of art and anthropology).

I introduced the workshops by talking about my research, and the ways in which I envisage it could impact upon thinking about the future of rural communities, both in Oxfordshire and more generally. A series of discussion and task-based sessions followed (these were designed by me in partnership with Linda Watson of Oxfordshire Rural Community Council).

I circulated contact details and information on the outcomes of the workshops to participants to stimulate continued discussion and debate.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>A597573B-1B04-414B-BC62-57790FA9E24B</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54647120b27926.92009586</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>My research demonstrates that the disintegration of rural communities was not only, or even principally about class. Small rural communities displayed a strong sense of mutuality and common identity when made up of different social groups, if all believed they shared a common purpose. Until the end of the eighteenth century this sense of common purpose was inculcated and reinforced by the traditional paternalist system, and by calendar festivals. But at a more fundamental level, it was also about a shared commitment to 'agri[culture]' and husbandry. When large numbers of people within rural communities no longer shared this commitment, divisions and competing priorities began to emerge. This breakdown is presaged in the poetry of Robert Bloomfield, George Crabbe and John Clare, but it is most vividly represented in Ebenezer Elliott's poetry. For Elliott, writing in the late 1820s, the main source of community breakdown in small rural villages is the rise and sprawl of the middle classes. Jane Austen sensed that the middle classes presented a problem because they had no interest in the practicalities of farming. Indeed, as Elliott realised, they were often actively hostile to the farming interest, particularly if it presented itself in a smelly or untidy manner through the figure of the field labourer or the cottager. 

The middle classes wanted their villages to be neat and pretty. As we move into the twentieth century, the demands of the judges in best-kept village competitions would become more important than the demands of farmers and farm labourers. Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg's buddy-cop spoof film Hot Fuzz (2007) is about the lengths to which zombified villagers will go in order to secure victory in a best-kept village competition. Inspector Butterman and the local neighbourhood watch association murder anyone who threatens the image of Sandford. Sandford is an exaggerated version of Elliott's The Splendid Village where rural calendar festivals are stopped on the grounds that labouring people 'wert vulgar? [and] we are splendid now.' (III, l. 8)

More generally we have become increasingly isolated as a consequence of recent technological developments. The internet and mobile phone have made communication easier, but both developments also mean that there is less of a requirement for us to be in the same place in order to interact with one another. Of course if we are communicating more often by phone, e-mail, and social networks it is possible to argue that we are more, rather than less engaged. But this raises the question does increased communication per se make us part of a community? Does a community have to be rooted in a particular place? Burns did not think so. But his poetry represents a commonality and mutuality rooted in a very particular world view. This kind of commonality would not be replicable in a modern Britain that is predominantly secular, and in which the vestiges of spirituality are distinctly heterogeneous. In the Britain of today, commonality and mutuality is most likely to re-emerge out of a shared connection with place.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The Cameron government's 'big society' agenda is ostensibly driven by a desire to reconnect people (although some would argue that it is mainly about saving money). The 'big society' is hard to define. Part of the problem is that the government had not thought about what they meant by the phrase before introducing it. Then there is the fact that most of us do not live in connected and locally-orientated communities any more. I know some commentators have suggested that the big society is about volunteering, but on some level it must be about the reinvigoration of communities. This raises the question how are we to connect with, and support people who we do not know? The answer could lie in small rural villages. They could provide the testing grounds for new versions of mutuality-driven community, just as they did for Thelwall, More, Spence and Young during the 1790s.
 
As Peter Laslett observes, since 'we can only properly understand ourselves and our world, in the here and now, if we have something to contrast it with, the historians must provide that something.' The only way in which I would qualify Laslett's view is to make the point, as Aristotle did, that history cannot provide all the answers. I would argue that in addition we need to have some knowledge of how the past was represented in art and literature. We need some insight into what our ancestors felt about their world, and literature can provide this in a way that history cannot. For example, my study of Romantic writing suggests that people had the greatest investment in their communities when they were rooted in a common interest in work. In modern Britain work could be the key to new kinds of community in the countryside. The rising cost of transport is going to make the long-distance, or even the shorter commute less and less attractive in the not too distance future, even if such behaviour were environmentally sustainable. If we could find a way to attract small businesses back into rural villages this would be a starting point. Of course housing would also be an issue. In villages in many parts of Britain, the cheapest housing is well beyond the means of those on even a median wage, let alone those on low wages. One answer might be to link housing to work. In other words we could re-invent farm service for non-farming businesses. How we do this is matter for another book, and for debate in different forums. But it is a debate that needs to happen, because I do not believe that the market is going to provide the answer to our contemporary crisis of community.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E60D2955-C47B-478D-9CDC-5AFB10F5283B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546479aeecaf97.10606422</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0C153C44-22E9-4BF5-BDA8-B071E0815408</gtr:id><gtr:title>Romanticism and the Rural Community</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6b186cddb6c8bf3f977984e3ae03470a"><gtr:id>6b186cddb6c8bf3f977984e3ae03470a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>White, Simon J.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-137-28178-4</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>i_87125395363c05730a</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/J00104X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FB301405-099D-44B9-ADA9-75B11FDED8C0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>English Language &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
