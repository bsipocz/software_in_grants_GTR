Liver transplantation is a successful treatment for end-stage liver disease but is limited by donor organ availability. As a result of this donor shortage, 20% of patients are removed from, or die whilst on the UK waiting list every 2 years. It is therefore of great importance to identify ways of making more organs available for transplantation. One way of achieving this is through the utilisation of more &amp;quot;marginal&amp;quot; or suboptimal livers, accepting the potential risk of poorer outcomes. Fatty livers derive poor outcomes when transplanted and as a result, a large number are discarded. It is believed that fatty livers are particularly susceptible to the damage associated with cooling the organ for storage prior to transplantation. Obesity levels in the UK and worldwide are increasing at an alarming rate. With this, comes an increasing incidence of fatty liver disease and it is estimated that 33% of the UK population suffer from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. An increase of fatty livers in the donor pool is therefore inevitable and identifying methods of optimising and salvaging these livers for transplantation is essential. 

The key to successful transplantation of fatty livers may lie in organ preservation. Current practice involves cooling the organ with ice and a specialised preservation solution, termed static cold storage (SCS). New technology involves maintaining the liver on a machine that provides oxygen and nutrition to the liver at normal body temperature, known as normothermic machine perfusion (NMP). We believe that NMP will allow the safe transplantation of fatty livers by: 1) avoiding the deleterious effects of cooling; and, 2) enabling the delivery of de-fatting agents to the perfusion circuit to remove the fat from the liver before it is transplanted. 

At present the University of Oxford are leading a multi-centre randomised controlled trial comparing SCS and NMP as a preservation technique. Several fatty livers have been transplanted as part of the study and they provide a unique opportunity to compare outcomes from fatty livers transplanted via the two preservation techniques and compare them to normal, non-fatty livers. As part of the study protocol, liver biopsies are obtained prior to and at the end of the preservation period and following implantation of the liver in the recipient. I will analyse these biopsies and compare the fat content at the three time points in each group. I will also be able to assess the degree of damage associated with cooling after transplantation and compare this for fatty livers in the SCS and NMP groups. Post-transplant patient and organ outcomes will be compared in each group. The results obtained will provide a unique insight into the effects of NMP on fatty human livers, data which has not been reported to date.
I also plan to obtain 20 livers which have not been transplanted and discarded due to a high fat content. Tissue samples will be obtained and de-fatting agents which have previously shown to reduce the fat content of fatty rat liver cells will be validated and refined for human cells in a laboratory setting. Once the agents have been optimised, I plan to apply them to whole livers through the NMP circuit. By examining biopsy and perfusate samples from the circuit for fat content at specific time points during perfusion I will be able to establish the effect on NMP +/- de-fatting agents on fatty livers. I aim to gain an understanding of the process by which de-fatting occurs in the liver by investigating key processes of fat breakdown in the liver.

Through the above experiments I plan to demonstrate that a combination of NMP and de-fatting agents will allow the safe and reliable transplantation of fatty livers. This will result in more livers being transplanted and ultimately, lives saved.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Steatotic livers derive poor outcomes following transplantation due to their increased susceptibility to ischaemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) and therefore many are discarded. With an increasing incidence of fatty liver disease, an increase of hepatic steatosis in the donor pool is inevitable. This project aims to optimise steatotic livers for transplantation through normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) and de-fatting agents. 
The first objective is to determine changes in hepatocyte structure and function in human steatotic livers undergoing NMP. Liver biopsy samples from the biobank of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing static cold storage (SCS) with NMP as a preservation technique will be examined. The fat content of pre-perfusion biopsies will be compared with those at the end of perfusion and after re-perfusion in the NMP and SCS groups through histological analysis. 
The second objective is to establish the impact of NMP on improving viability of human steatotic livers by reducing IRI. Post-reperfusion biopsies of steatotic livers preserved via NMP and SCS from the same biobank will be analysed for evidence of IRI by investigating the presence of key cytokines, neutrophil infiltration and Kupffer cell activation.
Thirdly, I will compare recipient outcomes in the form of peak asparate aminotransferase and early allograft dysfunction from steatotic livers preserved via SCS and NMP using RCT data.
Finally, I will perfuse discarded human livers ex vivo via NMP and compare metabolic and histological changes when de-fatting agents are added through serial analysis of biopsy and perfusate samples. De-fatting agents previously successful in reducing lipid content of steatotic rat hepatocytes in vitro will be refined and validated for human steatotic liver cells in vitro before being applied to whole livers through the NMP circuit. Stable isotope tracers will be added to the circuit to investigate pathways involved in glucose and fatty acid metabolism.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>In March 2014, an inquiry report from the All-Party Parliamentary Hepatology Group (APPHG) advised NHS England to provide a strategy for tackling liver disease, which kills just under 11,000 people a year. It is clear, therefore, that liver disease is a high priority governmental healthcare target as it has a significant impact on the welfare of the population as well as serious cost implications. Liver transplantation is a successful cure for end-stage liver disease but is limited by a shortage of organs globally. A major reason for a liver to be discarded is the presence of excess fat within the liver. Fatty liver disease occurs as a result of obesity and its global incidence is increasing at an alarming rate. In the UK alone it is estimated that one third of adults suffer from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). An increase of fatty livers in the donor pool is inevitable and it is therefore essential to identify methods to facilitate the safe and reliable transplantation of these organs. This will derive enormous therapeutic, economic and societal benefits. 
This project primarily aims to directly benefit patients with end-stage liver disease who require a transplant as a life-saving procedure. The current shortage of donor livers results in many patients needlessly dying whilst on the waiting list. I believe that by conducting this research project, it will be evident that fatty livers can be salvaged through the use of normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) and de-fatting drugs which will enable their safe transplantation with improved results. This will result in a large increase in available organs and less patients will die whilst on the waiting list. There will be fewer post-operative complications, associated with an improved survival rate and quality of life. 
The transplant community, including the whole multidisciplinary team, stand to gain enormously from this research. With an increased utilisation of organs, comes an increased work-load which provides more clinical experience, further funding for clinical and academic activities, enhanced departmental status and further opportunities to advance the field. This work could stimulate further research investigating NMP as a route of administration for therapeutic interventions such as gene and stem cell therapy to further optimise livers. 
Due to the fact that this study is focusing on fatty livers, there is a great potential to learn and understand the metabolic processes involved in fat metabolism within the liver, particularly in the context of de-fatting. This will be of great interest to academic clinicians and scientists in this field. We have the unique opportunity to observe a functioning human liver ex vivo and can investigate functional and metabolic changes that occur in fatty livers and when de-fatting agents are added. Our local and international collaborating colleagues at the Oxford Centre for Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism and Rutger's School of Engineering will assist in maximising the potential in this aspect of the project. They will also provide me with a platform to disseminate the results to the relevant interested parties. 
Our project partners, OrganOx Ltd, stand to gain from this research as it aims to highlight the benefits and applications of their medical device. It will be the first study which uses the device as a drug-delivery system. This will increase the company's profile within the industry. 
In completing this research project I stand to gain both professionally and personally and it will allow me to fulfil my ambition of becoming an academic liver transplant surgeon and advancing the scientific field in my area of clinical interest, an achievement of which I would be extremely proud.
I believe this project to be achievable in 2 years and hope that following dissemination of results and uptake of the technology, the transplantation of fatty livers will become a routine practice within the next 5 years.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>142951</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Oxford</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Division of Cardiovascular Medicine</gtr:department><gtr:description>NMP-MRI</gtr:description><gtr:id>E0908A9F-DB03-458D-A9AC-30A1F298128B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Collaboration has been established although there has been no data output as of yet.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c66ade2970c5.20010782-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>MRI scanning of steatotic livers for fat quantification.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Provision of livers for research and technical expertise to prepare and initiate the perfusion.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>62AE5E92-211B-4AF0-B00D-C20EE65DE526</gtr:id><gtr:title>Cold storage or normothermic perfusion for liver transplantation: probable application and indications.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Current opinion in organ transplantation</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f1596d2cb0f8cd42fe3a065d322677fe"><gtr:id>f1596d2cb0f8cd42fe3a065d322677fe</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ceresa CDL</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1087-2418</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5aa1b035d32e20.08403826</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A1C0A6EF-0371-40B1-8779-25BCE0893145</gtr:id><gtr:title>The case for normothermic machine perfusion in liver transplantation.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Liver transplantation : official publication of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the International Liver Transplantation Society</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f1596d2cb0f8cd42fe3a065d322677fe"><gtr:id>f1596d2cb0f8cd42fe3a065d322677fe</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ceresa CDL</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1527-6465</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a6f3098414821.76147596</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/P001734/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>D81A471F-556F-4570-BF6A-5D197943223C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Oral and Gastrointestinal</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
