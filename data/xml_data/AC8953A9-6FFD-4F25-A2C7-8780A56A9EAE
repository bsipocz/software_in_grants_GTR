Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/M027007/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This project consists of a two year programme which aims to bridge the gap between Engineering, Natural Sciences and Physical Sciences and AMR Research. The purpose of the programme is to try and engage these disciplines in multidisciplinary research which is important and relevant in tackling the catastrophic threat that antimicrobial resistance poses. The programme is principally designed to develop a cohort of interdisciplinary research fellows who through the programme, will develop a unique set of hybrid research skills, a positive attitude to multidisciplinary research and the ability to communicate across traditional academic boundaries. We aim that these individuals will become the potential future leaders in multidisciplinary research into AMR. Supporting this main aim, are a range of activities designed to bridge the gaps between disciplines, encourage researchers in different disciplines to engage in collaborative AMR research while also providing valuable learning experiences for the fellows. Activities include developing a virtual network for AMR research, organising conferences and seminars, a sandpit exercise and supporting pump-primed AMR projects.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The aim of this programme of research is to deliver a cohort of multidisciplinary researchers in AMR with the potential to become leaders in cross-discipline working. The aim of this capacity building and the associated activities are to stimulate research into AMR. The societal and economic costs of AMR are difficult to quantify, they include the health and economic burdens for the individual, their dependants, employers, businesses and the wider economy. In 2009, it was estimated by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) that AMR costed the EU about 1.5 billion Euro in healthcare expenses and lost productivity each year. 

Reductions in treatment failure through improved diagnostics, technologies to support more appropriate prescribing or better clinical management facilitated through improved surveillance and data-linkage would reduce the instances of AMR and its associated costs. It is possible that such advances may result in the future from our initial-stage development of discipline-spanning fellows, equipped to tackle the challenges of AMR in a multifaceted, integrated way.

The small pump-priming projects which will be funded as part of the programme may also have a more immediate impact on AMR. It is our ambition that as many of these as possible should be translational - i.e based on real problems at the diagnostic bench or the patient bedside, with a clear aim of ultimately bringing some practical benefit to the NHS or other agencies with a role to play in addressing AMR. The beneficiaries of such work should therefore be clinicians, other healthcare workers and policy makers and through them, the general public under their care. It is hoped that the partnerships made available through the HPRU will greatly facilitate the translation of any relevant innovation or findings, into our local NHS or into policy formulation at the PHE with some resulting impact on clinical care

In addition to the economic benefits which would accrue from a reduction in AMR on any level, there is also potential economic benefit should any of the research conducted as part of the pump-priming projects or any research conducted as a result of grant applications submitted by partnerships established through this initiative, be developed into a marketable product. Imperial College has a well-established technology transfer arm and Professor Toumazou has an existing portfolio of spin-out companies which hold over 50 patents and employ over 350 people. It is therefore possible that research resulting from this initiative may also see academia operating as an engine for economic growth among SMEs if they led to the development of start up companies.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>749583</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>In the 5th annual Imperial festival EMBRACE ran the &amp;quot;Infection Investigator&amp;quot; in the Superbug Zone.

Identifying the correct combinations completed electrical circuits to power light bulbs or motors, providing visual real-time feedback on their decisions. The game focused on three different pathogens responsible for many common infections (viruses, bacteria and fungi); fun facts and information on the differences between these microorganisms were also provided. The design proved to be extremely popular, especially for families, with around 200 participants over the weekend.

The game was designed to represent how the three Faculties (Medicine, Engineering and Natural Sciences) involved in the EMBRACE program can combine to tackle problems associated with Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR). 

This event successfully provided learning experiences for the Bridging The Gap fellows through cross-disciplinary interaction. This event gave our fellows a wider audience outside their discipline/department, it was a unique opportunity to break down barriers and encourage engagement from the students and general public, bringing visibility to the research being done in AMR at the Imperial College.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58be888abf4934.72241346</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>&quot;Infection Investigator&quot; game to show multidisciplinary approach to AMR</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Imperial College London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Life Sciences</gtr:department><gtr:description>&amp;quot;Antimicrobial resistance in gut communities&amp;quot;</gtr:description><gtr:id>9C818B90-BDC2-4BEE-BEF6-C74955C8A923</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Collaboration is multi-disciplinary involving Mathematics, Surgery &amp;amp; Cancer, Medicine and Infectious Diseases. 
An important outcome can be translated in the formation of a completely new collaboration between four departments in two faculties led by Caroline Colijn (CC) from the Dep of Mathematics.
Key outcomes: Biological (1) direct observation and quantification of competition between AMR and AMS genes in clinically relevant bacterial communities would lead to a high impact publication in this field. Our determination of how individual genes are affected directly by the antibiotic or indirectly by complex community dynamics will also lead to new results on the function of microbial communities. (2) Our multiple perspective (metabolomics, metagenonomics, modelling) will give an unprecedented and rich view of the link between sequence, diversity and function for microbial communities under antibiotics.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58931b2ed3b183.13808722-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Our partners will produce novel methods for deep characterisation of metagenomic datasets, with a focus on the dynamics of AMR. Lesley Hoyles metagenomic pipeline at ICL is an ideal opportunity to build in Caroline Colijn's mathematical tools. (4) They will develop the tools to integrate metagenomic and metabolomic data to compare treated and untreated samples. An R package containing these extensions would be a key publishable outcome. (5). Our partners will model competition dynamics to predict effects of treatment for some samples using models developed on other samples, setting the stage for model-based design of optimal treatment in future studies.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>In this project the team will directly observe how antibiotics drive interactions between AMR and anti-microbial sensitive (AMS) genes and how they affect metabolic function in human gut microbial communities.

Desorption Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry Imaging (DESI-MSI) provides an ideal MS imaging technique to examine the in situ spatial distribution of micro-organisms and related molecules within clinical samples. For this the EMBRACE team shall utilise existing fixed lung tissues from a TB mouse model together with macrophages (uninfected vs infected with pathogenic and non-pathogenic mycobacteria) from our in cellulo model and apply DESI to identify and locate lipids, within the tissue or cell, abundant only during infection (through comparison with normal tissue and uninfected macrophages). 
In parallel, this multidisciplinary team shall use our expertise medicinal chemistry to generate chemical intervention tools targeting inositol lipids.

The proposed outcome of this project is to develop REIMS based protocols that can be used for AMR detection. It will be used to identify specific antimicrobial resistance mechanisms; thereby aiding timely treatment and infection control practices to be implemented. In the long term a rapid point of care device will be developed based upon the detection of bacterial species-specific biomarkers (instead of species-specific spectral patterns), which can be detected at trace levels in clinical samples.

To achieve the overall aim of the project, the following measureable milestones/objectives will be tackled:
MILESTONE 1 (month 3): Establish via biophysical characterisation the formation of G-quadruplexes from murE and ftsB's promoters. For this, we will use short sequences (20-30 bases long) and carry out in vitro assays.
(To be carried out in the Vilar lab with support from Dr Evans and Dr Rahman)
? MILESTONE 2 (month 6): Once biophysical characterisation is completed, luciferase assays (with wild type and mutated promoters) will be carried out to study the regulatory role of G-quadruplex DNA in these genes.
(To be carried out in the Filloux lab with support from Dr Modarai and Prof Vilar)
? MILESTONE 3 (month 9): Demonstrate that small molecules known to target G-quadruplexes can stabilise this structure in the promoters of the genes under study and in doing so down-regulate their expression.
(To be carried out using compound libraries available in Vilar and Rahman labs with support from Dr Evans)
? MILESTONE 4 (month 12): Show that downregulation of murE and/or ftsB by small molecules challenges bacterial survival and/or leads to re-sensitisation of resistant bacteria to a given antibiotic

Over 30 investigators from Imperial College and Universities of Newcastle, Surrey and Warwick gathered at South Kensington. The four EMBRACE co-PI's, Professors Chris Toumazou (Engineering), Alison Holmes (Medicine), Alan Armstrong (Natural Science) and Pantelis Georgiou (Engineering) were responsible for stimulating and provoking the participants with short talks and sharp questions. The three EMBRACE fellows, Doctors Lindsay Evans (Natural Science), Maryam Modarai (Medicine) and Pau Herrero (Engineering), were among the participants. 

During the first day, several activities involving a lot of creative methods and soapbox talks were conducted in order to get to know each other and get a better picture of the expertise in the room. Lewis Preece from EPSRC gave a talk on the longer term funding opportunities that are on offer, and which could be used to obtain follow-up funding after the sandpit. The day ended with a dinner at 58 Prince's Gate.
The second day of the sandpit was focused on creating multidisciplinary teams of 4-8 participants and writing short, innovative proposals tackling the problem of AMR. At the end of the day, 5 proposals were presented which were evaluated by a panel of experts formed by Professors Alison Holmes, Alan Armstrong, Pantelis Georgiou and Ramesh Wigneshweraraj.

The requirement for projects to be interdisciplinary and with new collaborations has led to people working together that would not have otherwise.

As with all EMBRACE activities, our conference was designed to build multidisciplinary research capacity to tackle antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and to delve into the multi-faceted nature of the antimicrobial resistance problem which requires collaborative innovation on new diagnostics, improved surveillance, effective behaviour change and improved education. Also noted was the importance of translational and interdisciplinary research in this context, and Imperial's tradition of innovative research in this area. The conference included sessions on Data, Diagnostics and the Molecular Perspective, plus a panel discussion and poster competition.
Providing a meeting point for engagement with other researchers, breaking down barriers and increasing the profile of AMR research outside the Medicine and Life sciences departments. With this in mind, the winners of the first pump-priming competition where also announced and a presentation of their projects was made.
The event was also used to advertise the Bi-monthly seminar series which include speakers from other institutions and researchers from wide range of disciplines. 

In order to build up momentum and create more opportunities for cross-disciplinary interaction, our sandpit event was also advertised. The aim was to get more participants for the event in July in order to develop a large scale research proposal. 

The conference gave researchers from Imperial and beyond the opportunity to see some of the innovative AMR research underway, and, just as importantly, enabled investigators and other researchers across the College to embark on new areas of multi-disciplinary work through the contacts that where made but also created opportunities for established groups to work towards developing larger funding proposals.

The conference brought together a host of world-leading researchers in the fields of antimicrobial resistance and infectious diseases, as well as representatives from government, industry and funding bodies. The conference attendees were also given the opportunity to visit the Data Science Institute's observatory, where Dr Ceire Costelloe demonstrated visualisations of antibiotic prescriptions and patterns of disease in the UK. 

The first session of the conference centred on updates from ARC's research fellows and ended with a keynote lecture delivered by Dr Mark Holmes (University of Cambridge Veterinary School), and focused on how the natural history of AMR genes can be examined in the animal host through the use of chromosome conformation metagenomics. The second session looked at data linkage and data visualisation for research and policy follwed by a third session focused on identifying targets in AMR. The fourth session of the day was centred on understanding the emergence of resistance and the fifth and final session included discussions on innovation in technology for diagnosis and dosing.

The conference concluded with a topical panel discussion. The panel members included Professor John Watson, Deputy Chief Medical Officer for the Department of Health, keynote speaker Dr Mark Holmes, Ghada Zoubiane of the MRC, and industry representatives Hideki Maki, Shionogi, and Helen Steel, GSK. The panel discussed the impact of Brexit on AMR research, with all agreeing that collaboration would still be essential to future progress in the field.

Professor John Watson underlined the necessity of considering how resource-poor countries can be allowed full access to antibiotics, without causing problems of excess. In his closing remarks Professor John Watson stated &amp;quot;one country alone clearly cannot deal with this problem [of AMR]&amp;quot;.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bae55db7f9a1.10717662</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/medicine/departmentofmedicine/newssummary/news_28-9-2016-10-45-49</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Second 'All-Networks' AMR meeting hosted by SHAMROK at Sheffield</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FE55385A-B34D-4CAF-A2A8-74AE95E89471</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The second meeting of the consortium was hosted by the SHAMROK network at Sheffield University in the Council Room, Firth Court.

Through lectures, interactive group work and laboratory research projects they covered topics as diverse and wide-ranging as stress to big data. On the penultimate day of the school, the EMBRACE team joined forces with Dr Mariam Sbaiti from the School of Public Health to deliver a day on Antimicrobial Resistance &amp;amp; Global Health.

The day commenced with an introduction to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) from Dr Maryam Modarai (EMBRACE fellow, department of Medicine). This charted the discovery and widespread implementation of antibiotics to treat bacterial infections (a true revolution in biomedicine!), the emergence of resistance infection and the mechanisms by which they arise, and the potential post-antibiotic era that we face today. This was followed by two research talks from Imperial's Antimicrobial Resistance Collaborative (ARC) fellows, Dr Martina Valentini and Dr Myrsini Kaforou. Both talks focused on specific areas of research within the field of AMR that are currently being undertaken at Imperial College, introducing the students to current research topics and giving insight into the world of biomedical research.

The students had opportunity to ask questions about AMR in the broader context and promoted discussions between the panel and students. Important topics such as the economic reasons behind the lack of new antibiotics coming to market in the last 30 years, the effects of unregulated antibiotic use, and why bacteriophages, which are a popular alternative to antibiotics in countries such as Russia, are not used worldwide were discussed.

The day was highly successful in fulfilling its aims of engaging the next generation of scientists and medics on the threat of AMR and the complex problems that feed into global health issues. The students particularly enjoyed hearing about the cutting-edge research at Imperial College and the opportunity for discussion with people working in these important research areas. This event was also a fantastic opportunity for those involved in the day, giving experience of collaborating with multiple departments to deliver a focused day of interdisciplinary teaching.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>589da8026059d4.12144246</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Undergraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.imperial.ac.uk/arc/embrace/news-and-articles/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Metting with Shionogi (Japanese pharma company)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A1D2497F-DB58-4AF5-8563-FBD440B567D7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr Andrew Edwards is currently in discussion with Shionogi (Japanese pharma company), who are keen to become involved in his work on &amp;quot;Promoting Immune Clearance of Bacterial Pathogens&amp;quot; a Sandpit award from EMBRACE.

The game focused on three different pathogens responsible for many common infections (viruses, bacteria and fungi); fun facts and information on the differences between these microorganisms were also provide. It was designed to be played as a team and proved to be extremely popular, especially for families, with around 200 participants over the weekend.

Important points of discussion included recognising that flu is caused by a virus and as a result is not susceptible to antibiotic treatment and increasing the awareness on the different types of infection and what treatments are appropriate for each.

The game was designed to represent how the three Faculties (Medicine, Engineering and Natural Sciences) involved in the EMBRACE program can combine to tackle problems associated with Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR). It successfully provided learning experiences for the Bridging The Gap fellows through cross-disciplinary interaction. This event gave our fellows a wider audience outside their discipline/department, it was a unique opportunity to break down barriers and encourage engagement from the students and general public, bringing visibility to the research being done in AMR at the Imperial College.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>589da08e4fdbc6.22631445</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>AMR Cross Council Initiative phase 2 - A challenge-led approach Working group</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9B73CDFF-9E7B-450C-A6EE-C786961DF32E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Recognising the challenges of working across 'distant' disciplines (leadership, different languages, methodologies, productivity, publications, follow on funding, recognition etc) this meeting aimed to set a working group that can discuss the interdisciplinary research challenges in ABR and how best to overcome them.

The guest reader was Professor Alasdair &amp;quot;Alex&amp;quot; Cook who is a veterinary epidemiologist with more than 25 years national and international experience in livestock animal health in Government, academic and development environments. Alex is a firm believer in a multi-disciplinary team approach to research, engaging with molecular biologists, microbiologists and socio-economists to name but a few. This idea brought both groups together and further collaboration is planned with a joint data visualisation workshop as well as a series of seminars/workshops on drug detection technology and devices; longitudinal study on education and AMR stewardship and economics and prescribing.

Our second reader of the day was Dr Caroline Colijn on &amp;quot;Bacterial Olympics: Competition and resistance&amp;quot;. She works with a broad aim to develop the mathematical tools to connect sequence data for pathogens to pathogen ecology. Caroline also has a long-standing interest on the dynamics of diverse interacting pathogens. Her group is building new approaches to analysing phylogenetic trees derived from pathogen sequence data, studying tree space and branching processes, and doing ecological and epidemiological modelling. 

After the presentations the attendees stayed for our charity bake sale and coffee morning, part of the Great British Tea Partyorganised to help Antibiotic Research UK to raise valuable funds for research, education and patient support. We raised over &amp;pound;120 and sold delicious cakes made for the event by members of our team.

The morning was highly successful in fulfilling our aims of raising awareness and funds to the World Antibiotic Awareness Week and also engaging with researchers from Surrey School of Veterinary Medicine, following an earlier meeting in July.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bae629b18b00.75062232</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/medicine/arc/newssummary/news_30-11-2016-12-22-16</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>70000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>BBSRC DTP grant - PHD Studentship Grant</gtr:description><gtr:end>2020-10-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>306A3110-8DC5-4596-8893-ACF41B10E7EC</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c29935c04543.00700301</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>1469490</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Efficacy and Mechanism Evaluation Programme (EME) Medical Research Council (MRC)</gtr:description><gtr:fundingOrg>Medical Research Council (MRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>69630698-C7FE-46B2-82A9-3AF939DB00F2</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c28647bb9242.48953570</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>100</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>France, French Republic</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>EUR</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>Austria</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>de_AT</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>M&amp;eacute;rieux Research Grant</gtr:description><gtr:fundingOrg>Merieux Institute (Institut M?rieux)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>D474EFAB-7ABB-48D0-ABFF-DFF04758B82C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c71598942750.50060837</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>209169</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Global Challanges Research Fund</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-03-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>593A9FF7-ADA4-4982-93C1-EEE58A36720D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c298abc71906.25236501</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-07-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>125000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Wellcome Trust Pathfinder award for &amp;quot;Selective targeting of drug-resistant pathogens without affecting the microbiota&amp;quot;</gtr:description><gtr:end>2018-12-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Wellcome Trust</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>75713C7E-EAA3-4649-9A74-D8ED92B8BBCC</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58a2f0920f6f68.90836583</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-03-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This award is a bridging the gaps fund aimed at facilitating cross-disciplinary collaboration and research in Antimicrobial resistance. As part of this award we have:

1. Conducted a first pump priming call on January 2016, where we awarded two pump-priming grants (&amp;pound;10K each) to cross-faculty teams who took part in our pump-priming competition, and which received 6 entries. The successful projects involve new collaborations between researchers from at least two of our three science faculties. The conditions for the awards include the development of consequent full research proposals and the further interdisciplinary development of the EMBRACE Fellows, as well as demonstrating creativity. First project: 'Targeting quadruplex-DNA in the promoters of genes associated to antimicrobial resistance' (AMR). This is a collaboration between Faculties of Medicine and Natural Science at Imperial College London + Institute of Pharmacy at Kings College London. Second project: 'Rapid Evaporative Ionisation Mass Spectrometry for the Early Detection of Antimicrobial Resistance'. This is a collaboration between all three science faculties: Engineering, Natural Science and Medicine.

2. Conducted a second pump priming call on September 2016, where we awarded three pump-priming grants (&amp;pound;10K each) to cross-faculty teams who took part in our pump-priming competition, and which received 11 entries. The successful projects involve new collaborations between researchers from at least two of our three science faculties. The conditions for the awards include the development of consequent full research proposals, further interdisciplinary development of the EMBRACE Fellows, as well as demonstrating creativity and new consortium formation. First project: &amp;quot;Antimicrobial resistance in gut communities&amp;quot;. This collaboration is multi-disciplinary involving the Faculties of Medicine and Natural Science at Imperial College London at Imperial College London. Second project: &amp;quot;LIPID-MINDS: Lipid Mapping to Identify Novel Drug Solutions&amp;quot;. This is a highly multi-disciplinary project between the Faculties of Medicine and Natural Sciences at Imperial College London and involving the School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Surrey. Third project: Real-time Enhanced Antimicrobial ConTroller (REACT). This is a collaboration between all three science faculties: Engineering, Natural Science and Medicine.

3. Conducted a Sandpit event on July 2016 which awarded one grant (&amp;pound;15K) to the following project: &amp;quot;Promoting Immune Clearance of Bacterial Pathogens&amp;quot;. This award is a multidisciplinary collaboration from all three science faculties: Engineering, Natural Science and Medicine. This was a result of a two-day event with over 30 investigators from Imperial College and Universities of Newcastle, Surrey and Warwick gathered at the South Kensington Campus to participate in our first EPSRC supported EMBRACE Sandpit to propose innovative solutions to address the challenge of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR).

4. Run our first conference entitled Multidisciplinary Approaches to Tackling AMR, 9th March 2016. This was heavily oversubscribed - 137 delegates registered for 100 places. This engaged researchers across Imperial, industry representatives and researchers from other institutions including other ERSRC Bridging the Gaps projects. The conference was opened by the President of IC and closed by the Provost. We have tracked new associations arising from the conference participation within days of the event (http://www.imperial.ac.uk/arc/embrace/conference-9-march-2016/). Currently we are also working on the &amp;quot;Technology vs Infectious Diseases: An Imperial College / Royal Institution Summit&amp;quot;. The Summit will be held at the Royal Institution's historic home in Mayfair, London on 26 September 2017. The Summit will feature two panel discussions featuring some of the foremost thinkers who are tackling the global challenge of infectious diseases. Between sessions there will be time to chat to researchers who will be presenting their latest findings. Following the afternoon presentations, the evening will be given over to a keynote address, given by a world-renowned figure. The evening will be hosted by Sir Richard Sykes, Chair of the Royal Institution and former Rector of Imperial College.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Outcomes so far include:
1. We have hired 3 cross-disciplinary fellows, one in Engineering, one in Chemistry and one in Medicine and the events scheduled in this award are facilitating their development towards independent research careers and applying for EPSRC fellowships. Our fellows are becoming increasingly active in the emergent network of EPSRC Bridging the Gaps projects. 
2. We have awarded five pump priming awards and a sandpit award to generate crossdisciplinary-collaboration within the Faculties of Imperial for new research in AMR. The outputs of these will be pilot date for larger collaborative grants in AMR.
3. We have run our first of two conferences which has enable cross-disciplinary networking within the field of AMR and formation of new collaborations.
4. Successfully engaging the Royal Institution to organise a summit on AMR. This event will be a great showcase for the research being done at Imperial College London and will increase the profile of AMR and multidisciplinary research.
5. Real-time Enhanced Antimicrobial ConTroller (REACT). This multidisciplinary pump priming project from Medicine, Electronic Engineering, Bioengineering, and Chemistry already received further funding which will see it developed and applied in the clinic.
