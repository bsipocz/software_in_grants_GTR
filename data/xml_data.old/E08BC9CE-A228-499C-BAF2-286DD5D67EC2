Numbers stations can appear on shortwave frequencies without warning, announcing themselves with a musical tone, followed by a ream of seemingly random numbers and words read out by an automated voice, often accompanied by indecipherable noises, before disappearing as suddenly as they came. Despite existing for decades worldwide, there has been next to no research on these broadcasts.

The project will examine numbers stations as an example of a covert state practice that crosses over into the public sphere, that leaves traces in its wake, in the form of broadcasts that can be picked up on a radio by anyone. There is a growing literature on the ways in which state secrecy does not simply remove things from the public sphere by covering them up, but can itself become part of the public sphere. Acts of keeping things secret can leave a public mark: from an official's refusal to confirm or deny a story, to the black ink of a redacted sentence. These marks reflect the use of secrecy to project state power, but can also have political effects in excess of state intentions - redactions in a torture investigation can imply unsavoury practices that the state would rather hide.

In the past, traces of secrecy have been understood primarily as speech acts or as material visible phenomena: the fences surrounding a military base, or the carefully chosen words of a politician. By contrast, this research will investigate secrecy that operates through sound, both vocal and non-vocal. Numbers station broadcasts are sounds that produce secrecy as something aural in the public sphere. These radio frequencies allow states to carry out secret practices, while the sonic qualities of the broadcasts - from their robotic voices, to radio silence and static - ascribe characteristics to that secrecy, just as the words or redactions of a government can imply different things about their attempts to hide things. These sounds can represent secrecy, moreover, in ways that exceed state intentions. This process is also shaped by how sounds are accessed; state secrecy is shaped not just by numbers station broadcasts, but by the act of 'tapping into' these stations. As traces of state practices, these broadcasts also manifest the state as a covert actor, heard but not seen, and encourage particular understandings of the state that carry political consequences.

Numbers stations offer a unique opportunity to explore how state secrecy exists aurally, in ways that go beyond visual understandings of secrecy as that which hides or makes invisible. These broadcasts open up space for considering the conceptual links between sound and secrecy: the ways in which sound is both a novel resource for states to practice secrecy, and a material that broadens our ideas of how secrecy exists in, and impacts on, the public sphere.

This project will therefore document how numbers station broadcasts reproduce the state and secrecy in public, and will use this analysis to rethink state secrecy in terms of sound. To complete these objectives, this project will first examine the known history and geography of numbers stations, and what this tells us about states' covert operations; second, carry out field recordings of radio frequencies used by numbers stations, to analyse how these broadcasts and their interception reproduce state secrecy in public space; and third, analyse recordings of these broadcasts on internet archives, to understand how sonic secrecy implicitly shapes the meaning attached to states' covert activities. Out of this, the project will produce academic and magazine writings on how state secrecy shapes public life, and a website that makes the research findings accessible to the public and relates the research to current debates around state secrecy and covert practices.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research will have three main groups of users and beneficiaries. The first is civil society activists and organisations, primarily based in Europe and the United States, focused on issues of state secrecy. Over the past decade, public interest in the use of secrecy by Western liberal states for security purposes has increased, due to revelations of surveillance and spying, and the shift towards covert counter-terrorism. Activists and organisations have scrutinised the use of this secrecy and its potential political effects, both on states' ability to conduct unaccountable action and on public understandings of their governments and of international relations. Organisations such as the Remote Control Project and Statewatch have tried to document the use of state secrecy and to analyse the possible contents of those secrets, while individual activists have discussed the implications of these developments in publications including New Internationalist and Open Democracy.

The research will greatly benefit these civil society groups in two ways. First, the research results will demonstrate how covert practices can be documented and analysed, not despite, but precisely because of states' attempts to prevent public scrutiny of its policies. The research will provide methodological tools that overcome the view of secrecy as a barrier to analysis, by using the act of secrecy itself as a data source, analysing how that act manifests in the public sphere in ways beyond states' control, and what it reveals about the political power of secrecy. Second, the research will offer a new way of thinking about what secrecy is and how it operates in public life, by re-conceptualising secrecy through its relationship to sound.

The second beneficiary is the general newsreading public, primarily in Britain and the United States but also more generally in Western liberal democratic states. Media studies scholarship has concluded that citizens of these states are significantly ill-informed about their governments' covert actions and policies (eg. Moorehead et al 2017). News coverage often inaccurately reports on available information, or is too sparse and speculative to benefit public knowledge. The secrecy which surrounds covert operations, moreover, is treated simplistically in news analysis, which rarely considers the effects of secrecy itself on geopolitics and on public understandings.

The research and its outputs will benefit the newsreading public by demonstrating how secrecy does not simply restrict public knowledge, but shapes public representations of the state and its activities. Both the numbers station research and the PI's previous analysis of covert counter-terrorism will be used in research outputs as examples of how secrecy has political effects in the public sphere. The research will thereby provide this constituency with evidence of how state secrecy can affect political debate and understandings in often inconspicuous ways, regardless of the level of public knowledge of those secrets' contents, and how this potential effect can be identified. The research will also offer an alternative political position on state secrecy, beyond the current binary choice between uncritical acceptance of states' justifications for secrecy and conspiracy theorising.

Finally, the research will benefit amateur radio enthusiast communities who gather information and recordings of numbers stations broadcasts but who are unable to discern these broadcasts' content or purpose. By placing this group's work in an historical and political context, the research will encourage this constituency to consider numbers stations in terms of how state secrecy impacts the public sphere, including through this group's own archiving work. The research will also provide this group with methodological tools to gain more knowledge from their recordings, and conceptual tools to understand why these opaque broadcasts may provoke such intense amateur interest.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-01-08</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-07-09</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>161107</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/R006059/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A7A7771C-0BD1-472E-BDD3-CB8A79BDF410</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Internat.
