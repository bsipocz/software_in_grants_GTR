However, the foreign policy aspects of the UK's interrelationship with the EU is a topic that has received less attention in this debate. A strong desire for greater knowledge is evidenced by the recent decision by the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee (July 2015) to conduct an inquiry into the costs and benefits of EU membership for the UK's role in the world on the basis of the concern that leaving the EU could have significant implications for the UK's alliances and strategic partnerships, standing in other international organisations, soft power and national security. However, and as one scoping report for the ESRC notes, the interrelationship between the UK's and the EU's foreign policy is actually an under-researched area. 

This contrasts sharply to a rapidly growing body of literature on the development of the EU's foreign policy and other EU member states' relationships with EU foreign policy. Meanwhile, even fewer researchers have sought to make their research and findings accessible to a wider audience of non-academics. 

The aim of this innovative and collaborative Fellowship is to address these gaps. It is focused squarely on engaging decision-makers, stakeholders and civil society to exchange and cascade knowledge and understanding. The aim of the Fellowship is to improve understanding of the contemporary interrelationship between the UK and the EU in the area of foreign and security policy. In particular it will advance understanding of the current and future benefits and costs associated, for both the UK and the EU, with the UK's participation in the EU's foreign, security and defence policies. 

The Fellowship will address a series of questions highly relevant to a debate on the UK's future relationship with the EU: 

- What impact, if any, would leaving the EU have on the UK's foreign relations and standing within international multilateral organisations? 
- What would be the costs/benefits for the EU and its member states of a UK withdrawal or renegotiated relationship with the EU's foreign, security and defence policies? 
- And how might policy makers, practitioners, the media and public make sense of this challenge and navigate the associated issues? 

Answering these questions in an accessible and outward-facing manner will significantly inform the wider national debate about the future of the UK in a changing Europe.

To do so, the Fellowship draws upon and updates recent academic research on these questions that has only just begun to impact upon non-academic communities. It will add new understanding to existing research that are centred on these questions and then, together with the ESRC, the London-based think tank Chatham House, and the Brussels-based think tank European Policy Centre (EPC), communicate the power of social science through a series of high profile and accessible outputs. Workshops and sandpits with different groups of stakeholders, a series of evidence briefings, blogs, a final report, an accompanying launch event and social media will all be used to disseminate social science research on these areas to a wide and diverse audience.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The Project will benefit a wide and diverse range of academic and non-academic audiences, as outlined in the Pathways to Impact section. By examining the foreign policy aspects of the UK's interrelationship with the EU, working with the ESRC (and actively with the Programme Director and the Knowledge Forum) and think tanks in London and Brussels, the Fellowship will deliver twelve months of sustained knowledge exchange and impact-related activity, championing the social sciences and engaging with stakeholders from a range of organizations, including:

- UK-based policymakers who share an interest in the UK's relationship with the EU in Westminster and Whitehall and also in the devolved regions administrations, including senior civil servants and politicians in the Cabinet Office, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and, in Brussels, the European Commission and European Parliament. It should be noted that as a Fellow at both London (Chatham House) and Brussels (European Policy Centre) the Fellow is able to utilise extensive contacts in such institutions.

- Individuals in major political parties and advocacy groups, including the major political parties, Business for Britain, European Movement, British Influence, and senior Europe correspondents and journalists who write on these issues (e.g. at the BBC, Financial Times, Parliament Magazine, and The Economist).

- Think tanks that cover the EU and foreign policy issues, including the European Council on Foreign Relations; Centre for European Reform; Foreign Policy Centre, Centre for European Reform, Open Europe, Policy Network, Demos, the Institute for Public Policy Research and Policy Exchange.

-Regional opinion formers including elected members and staffers of devolved administrations, local press, civil society organisations (including business organisations) and the education sector.

The Fellowship will pursue multiple routes to impact:

- First, after updating and analysing the UK-EU foreign policy relationship the project will publish a regular series of policy papers and blogs, sharing them with beneficiaries via the ESRC, think tank (Chatham House and European Policy Centre) and the Global Europe Centre websites and on social media. The Fellow will actively encourage civil society (including schools and business organizations) to engage with us on social media and write some blogs specifically for these communities.

-Second, holding four specific focus group workshops around the United Kingdom, and for (1) regional opinion formers including members of parliament, members and officials of devolved administrations and local government, (2) local media editors and journalists, and (3) members of civil society including non-governmental organisations, regional business organisations and educationalists from secondary, tertiary and higher education organisations to help ensure that the research is cascaded and is influencing the national debate from multiple angles.

-Third, users will further benefit from a final (10,000 word) report on the costs and benefits of EU membership for the UK's role in the world and using the imprimatur of Chatham House. Published online, the report will be fully accessible and also available in a podcast format to further its reach to the widest possible audience. 

-Fourth, beneficiaries will be invited to a major dissemination event in London (simulcast on the internet) in the winter of 2016 intended to directly engage end-users with the research

-Fifth, all materials relating to the project will be made available on the ESRC Fellowship website, a dedicated page on the Global Europe Centre website and regularly communicated through social media and in response to specific events.

-Sixth, academic users will benefit from 'high-impact' journal articles that examine the interrelationship between the UK's and the EU's foreign and security policies.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>151284</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Full Fact</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Full Fact - Facts behind the Claims (UK EU Referendum debate)</gtr:description><gtr:id>D36B0B97-B89B-45BF-AA01-DEB5DBE33BF3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Hard copy and web-based publication: https://fullfact.org/media/uploads/leave-remain-the-facts-behind-the-claims.pdf

In this scenario, it is argued, the UK could then fully use diplomatic and military capabilities alongside its soft power, its position as an unrivalled international financial centre and its memberships of the 'Anglosphere' and the Commonwealth, to seek new international influence, especially with rising powers.

The UK EU Referendum called during the provided an unanticipated basis for an generating an informed understanding of the interaction between UK and EU foreign and security policies and a heightened interest in the expertise of the award holder. 
The project was conducted in an manner that allowed for its findings, and the expertise of the PI, to be used through four main sets of activities.

1. Continuous and close collaboration with beneficiaries: Beneficiaries were directly involved in the project, either as subject of research, informants, or participants in focus groups and sandpit activities. Communication was conducted on an ongoing basis via social media (especially twitter and blogging) and direct communications and the participants were asked to provide feedback and advice at all stages of the project and most especially to the Policy Brief and Policy Paper publications. Most importantly, the focus group and sandpit, conference and workshop activities, were a forum of debates that informed thinking on the challenges faced by the UK with Brexit. The lessons gleaned from the focus groups and sandpit exercises were included both in the academic outputs, and as importantly in policy briefings, papers and blogs. The high degree of activity with blogging ensured that findings were communicated in an accessible manner to a variety of audiences. As indicative of this engagement the penetration with beneficiaries of the work produced under the award was directly referenced by the Chairs of the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee (in witness questioning during an evidence session [http://parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/af258076-813e-49e9-857b-cbc14dfb750e) and by the Chair of the House of Commons Committee Exiting the EU Committee (http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/hilary-benn/brexit-patriotism_b_15079646.html}. The PI was also invited to share insight of the research via oral evidence to the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee and in-camera knowledge exchange activities with the House of Commons Foreign Affairs, International Development and Public and Constitutional Affairs Committees [See 'Engagement Activities']
2. Public engagement: The UK EU referendum allowed for a very high degree of public engagement by preparing blogs, media commentary and briefings that allowed central findings and tangible recommendations to deal with relevant issues. Findings were published (and discussed) via a variety of think tanks in the UK, Brussels, Germany and Turkey, dealing with UK EU policy issues and EU foreign and security policy. The policy brief length publications were distributed to policy makers, parliamentarians, government agencies, independent agencies NGOs and civil society organisations. To maximize the potential of integrating findings into practice and evaluate the policy impact of the project, policy briefings were used as the basis to organise discussion for the focus group and sandpit exercises conducted through the project. were circulated the applicant will contact the participants interviewed during fieldwork to examine their reaction to the findings and discuss which policy recommendations they find more useful and possible to incorporate into their policies. More extensive policy papers and were produced (via Chatham House and NIESR) targeted at a UK audience of policy makers and government agencies and political elites in the UK and other European capitals to enhance understanding of the costs/benefits and strengths/weaknesses of the current and future engagement for the UK with the EU's foreign and security policies. A further policy paper is anticipated (the outcome of the non-cost extension to the project) that will focus on scenarios on possible futures for the UK and the EU in the area of foreign and security policy and be targeted at policy influencers and opinion formers in the UK, continental Europe and the United States.

3. Outreach activities: The project generated significant activity to enhance the visibility of the UK in a Changing Europe via full and active participation in the collective events, activities and publications of the initiative and so contributed to impact through its broader dissemination activities. All commentary, policy briefs and papers have been disseminated electronically and all academic journal publication has been made available on open access. The Senior Research Fellow engaged in significant media commentary and accepted a wide range of public speaking engagements for non-academic audiences during the duration of the fellowship. In addition the Senior Fellow engaged in the writing of op-ed and other commentary pieces utilising findings from the project to stimulate comment and debate on the UK-EU foreign policy making system and relating this to appropriate news and other EU referendum and Brexit developments. as indicative of the resonance of reach of ideas produced by the award holder references were made in major print publications including The Financial Times (https://www.ft.com/content/0f20e96a-f2b5-11e6-8758-6876151821a6?emailId=58a3cd280b6f690004679d05&amp;amp;segmentId=2f40f9e8-c8d5-af4c-ecdd-78ad0b93926b and https://next.ft.com/content/931bffc8-5253-11e6-befd-2fc0c26b3c60) [And for full details of all activity see 'Engagement activities']
4. Online resources: The outputs of the project were all made available via the UK in a Changing Europe website working with the communications team of the initiative. A dedicated project website was hosted and maintained by the Global Europe Centre, the dual-site University of Kent research centre (Canterbury and Brussels) collating material that was published on a variety of platforms (for example blogs and comment pieces). Chatham House also created a dedicated set of webpages devoted to the activities of the fellow where these were conducted in association with Chatham House. Social media outputs were utilized by the Fellow to allow for the cascade of information to the widest possible audience.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>73C3C9AD-098D-401C-B883-80426C09677F</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>58c7a7d9aa2627.98026484</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project was conducted in the context of the decision by Prime Minister David Cameron to renegotiate the terms of the UK's EU membership, put those revised terms to a referendum on the UK's membership of the EU and the UK electorate voting by a majority to seek withdrawal from the EU.

What were the most significant achievements from the award?
This context gave the project a heightened degree of capacity for impact. The core questions for the project were to assess the benefits and costs associated, for both the UK and the EU, with the UK's participation in the EU's foreign, security and defence policies. By conducting the work plan of the project (focus groups, sandpits, interview fieldwork, workshops and conferences) the PI was able to collect analyse and engage in a significant degree of dissemination of finding on the impact on the UK's foreign relations and standing within international multilateral organisations and the future benefits and costs for the UK and the EU of a UK withdrawal or renegotiated relationship with the EU's foreign, security and defence policies. A key achievement was to utilise this insight for a variety of impact and public engagement activities thereby transferring academic knowledge and understanding to both general public and specialist audiences. 

To what extent were the award objectives met?
The project realised all of the objectives of the award in delivering all of the activity outlined in the work plan. Due to the timing, and the result, of the UK EU referendum there was also the opportunity to broaden the project. Following the referendum result, the project also developed a new strand in identifying (and stimulated debate) on alternative models for the future EU-UK foreign, security and defence policy relationship post-Brexit. It also identified (and made provisional research findings) on an under-explored aspect of the UK's international profile with a focus on the prospective evolution of the Devolved Administrations' capacity for external affairs as powers are returned to the UK from the EU.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>A number of the findings of the project were taken forward during the period of the Referendum campaign to offer rigorous but accessible analyses of the costs/benefits for the UK's (and EU's) foreign, security and defence policies. Since the Brexit Referendum vote ideas generated by the project have demonstrated resonance by being referenced by journalist and politician users of the research. It is anticipated that the finding of the project will continue to be of continuing utility for these non-academic users of research. Key relationships have been developed with these user-constituencies during the project and it is anticipated that these will be developed in short and medium term.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8D83A0C8-5AAA-4489-B9BC-A2CDB2D49E8B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c7a8393de4c9.73793747</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://blogs.kent.ac.uk/uk-eu-foreignpolicy/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>ED83A944-9893-46B8-8FFF-046D61A140F3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Conference paper: Going Global or Staying Local?
