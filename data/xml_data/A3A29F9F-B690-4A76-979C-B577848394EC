Through the involvement of these industries in this project, and through the activities of May Barn Consultancy as an interface between the science outputs and grower practice, the outcomes on efficacies of control regimes, combined with the feasibility of commercialisation of fully automated delivery systems will be delivered to commercial concerns and other relevant stakeholders. The potential commercial impact of reducing losses caused by botrytis has been estimated at up to &amp;pound;220 million over 5 years in the UK alone, with the added impact that the extended shelf-life of produce could allow producers to expand and consider export opportunities in appreciable quantities. The pathway to impact beyond the commercial partners is also likely to involve commercialisation of the automated UVC delivery system for glasshouse use. The aim of the project is to provide a blueprint/model for UVB and UVC delivery that will then be an opportunity for a commercial concern to produce and market the equipment as a commercial business for UK and overseas markets.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-09-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>300210</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>- Baseline UV-C treatment conditions (dosages, timing, frequency, light wavelength and effect on obscured part of plants) for applications have been developed for tomatoes.
- Detailed protocols (experimental design, treatment regimes, data acquisition, health and safety) for tomato and rose commercial glasshouse UV-C trials have been developed and circulated to partners. Commercial testing of the UV-C equipment is now being undertaken on tomatoes and roses.

- Optimisation of ethylene treatment chambers has been achieved and ethylene removal capabilities of the scrubbing equipment confirmed in several experiments.

- RNAseq studies have been undertaken on UV-C treated plants, and the data is now being validated using qPCR and further experimentation.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Only 24 months of this 36 monthproject have been completed to date, and the work is now being taken forward by the commercial partners for further evaluation over the next 12 months of the project.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E71BCF65-0566-49A5-85F7-7ADE56ADF126</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56c0b53a8729a6.08919015</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2FFC2148-68C2-483C-B8ED-6B09AD177A75</gtr:id><gtr:title>A comparison of the molecular mechanisms underpinning high-intensity, pulsed polychromatic light and low-intensity UV-C hormesis in tomato fruit</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Postharvest Biology and Technology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/071e882d6d5617fac73b55ac1d8145b1"><gtr:id>071e882d6d5617fac73b55ac1d8145b1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Scott G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0925-5214</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a8596ce0bff21.45029025</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>34F47EDB-BF3F-4482-B5F1-065BA0DF908D</gtr:id><gtr:title>A comparison of low intensity UV-C and high intensity pulsed polychromatic sources as elicitors of hormesis in tomato fruit</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Postharvest Biology and Technology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/071e882d6d5617fac73b55ac1d8145b1"><gtr:id>071e882d6d5617fac73b55ac1d8145b1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Scott G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0925-5214</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a8596ce444118.76039754</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/M01214X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5B25B6A3-B218-4F11-8A9D-661236DF455C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agri-environmental science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>13975896-2E87-4DAA-99BC-E8D86B00B146</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Plant &amp; crop science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6F3E4891-E3E8-4568-94D8-075A0552DE90</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Crop protection</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8C69AA8D-0736-45EE-BA77-D6E60B4C9893</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Plant organisms</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
