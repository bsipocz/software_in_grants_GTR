The Clinical Trials Unit (CTU) is part of a programme of work which includes one completed trial, one trial currently enrolling and also the establishment of the Institute of Psychiatry Clinical Trials Unit (IOP CTU) in Kings College, London. The CTU has advised this unit from its inception and continues to mentor, particularly the statistical team.||CALM-AD was the first trial conducted in association with the CTU; the trial was designed to assess whether Donepezil can be used for the management of agitation in patients with Alzheimers disease who have not responded to a psychosocial treatment program or for whom this treatment is inappropriate. The original study included an additional group of patients allocated to Risperidone but, after four months of enrolment, the study was suspended following the recommendation by the UK Committee for Safety of Medicines that Risperidone should not be used for the treatment of behavioural symptoms in dementia. The trial was restarted without the Risperidone group and 272 patients were enrolled and allocated to 10 mg of Donepezil or placebo for 12 weeks.||There was no significant difference between Donepezil and placebo on the primary outcome of change in the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory from baseline (mean difference in change -0.06, 95% confidence interval (-4.35, 4.22)). These findings were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in October 2007.||A second trial, DOMINO-AD, is currently recruiting and is being managed by the IOP CTU in the same way as CALM-AD. Currently cholinesterase inhibitors are prescribed to patients with mild to moderate Alzheimers disease. There is inadequate evidence to support their use in moderate to severe disease. Memantine is the only drug licensed in UK for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe Alzheimers disease. The available data are limited and are insufficient to guide treatment for such patients.||The aim of DOMINO-AD is to determine, in patients who have reached the transition point to moderate to severe Alzheimers, whether a) continuing Donepezil (the most frequently prescribed cholinesterase inhibitor), or b) switching to Memantine, or c) taking a combination of Donepezil and Memantine, results in a significantly smaller decline in ratings of cognitive function and activities of daily living over the following 12 months than those discontinuing Donepezil.||The trial has a 2 x 2 factorial, placebo-controlled and double-blind design. The four arms are placebo, Donepezil, Memantine or Donepezil plus Memantine. Fifteen trial sites across England, Scotland and Northern Ireland are expected to enrol 800 participants over 2 years. The primary outcomes, at one year, are: sMMSE (a measure of cognitive function in elderly patients) and BADLS (a measure of activities of daily living).</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>70081</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Press conference for DOMINO paper at Science Media Centre</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A302C712-6EAB-4730-9EB7-77E1AFB59B58</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Press conference at Science Media Centre for DOMINO paper published in Lancet Neurology Oct 2015.
