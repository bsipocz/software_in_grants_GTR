No doubt this would be instinct if it were true, and I simply ask for proof of the fact&amp;quot;. With the proposed research I would like to provide the first experimental evidence to support this claim. Specifically, I propose to determine whether birds use information provided by other individuals to learn what nest to build. I would do this via experimentally manipulating the kind of information that is provided by experienced nest-building zebra finches and redpolls to first-time nest builders. In zebra finches it is the male that selects the nesting material and builds the nest while in redpolls, a native British bird, it is the female that both builds the nest and incubates the eggs. Three specific questions I will ask are: what types of information are learned, who do birds learn this information from, and when is it important to learn from other individuals? Different types of information birds could learn from watching experienced individuals build a nest include what type of nest material to select, where that material is located, and how to handle different types of material. Zebra finches and redpolls are both highly social species and in nature, first-time nest builders would have the opportunity to watch multiple nests be built by different individuals, some of which may be more successful (e.g. raise chicks) compared to others (e.g. no chicks). Finally, it is not clear whether once birds have experience building a nest of their own whether they will modify subsequent nests according to what they learn from others, or whether they just rely on their personal experience. By testing two species in the laboratory I can determine the generality of the responses I see, both relative to the sex of the builder and to the specific information provided to the first-time builder from the experienced builder. By coupling those laboratory data with data from birds building in out-door aviaries I can begin to assess the ecological validity of the laboratory results. Finally, this dual-species approach will allow me to exploit fully the data my host laboratory is currently collecting on the neural basis of nest building in zebra finches. For nearly all birds, nest building is the lynchpin to that bird's reproductive success and so it is a vital context in which a builder would benefit enormously from capitalising on the success of others' nest-building experiences. Demonstrating what information is used by these two species when making nest-building decisions is socially learned will begin to address the extent to which social cognition underpins this little-known but fundamental avian behaviour. Given the increasing concern over the flexibility of birds to respond to a changing climate it is timely to ask whether those birds that can recognise and copy the success of some, while avoiding the errors of others, are less vulnerable to environmental changes.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Although challenged by Alfred Russel Wallace as early as 1867, it is still typically thought that nest construction by birds is instinctive. And yet, evidence is beginning to accumulate showing that birds will modify their nest-building behaviour and the structure they build as a result of their own building experience. To date, all this evidence points to a significant role for individual (asocial) learning in modification of nests. These data, however, do not explain how it is that birds know what nest to build. For nearly all birds, nest building is the lynchpin to that bird's reproductive success and so it is a vital context in which a builder would benefit enormously from capitalising on the success of others' nest-building experiences. The question that I would like to address is whether social learning also plays a key role in the development and modification of nest-building behaviour in birds. This is a timely question given the increasing concern over the flexibility of birds to respond to a changing climate: those birds that can recognise and copy the success of some while avoiding the errors of others, may be less vulnerable to such changes. Here, therefore, I propose to ask what birds learn from observing others about nest building (e.g. colour/structure of nest material, locations of suitable material), who they copy (e.g. related vs unrelated or successful vs unsuccessful demonstrators) and when social learning is most important (e.g. age and context, such as nest building, song learning, mate choice, and foraging). I would do this via experimentally manipulating the kind of information that is provided by experienced nest building zebra finches and redpolls to first-time nest builders. In zebra finches it is the male that selects the nesting material and builds the nest, while in redpolls, a native British bird; it is the female that builds the nest. These would be the first experimental tests of the role of social information in nest building.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>In addition to academic colleagues working on basic and applied research in the fields of biology, psychology, and neuroscience, the beneficiaries of the proposed research range from the wider public to specialist groups in society, such birders and school children, and also to the industrial sector at the national and international level. 

Nests and nest building attract considerable public interest not only because of their aesthetic value but also because nests and the birds that build them are part of our everyday lives, whether one lives in an urban or rural environment. Public outreach based on this project will be disseminated through public lectures. For example, I recently gave an invited talk about 'bird cognition' at the 4th Annual Study Day at Edinburgh Zoo hosted by the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland and University of the Third Age (U3A) Scotland in June 2014. The goal of the U3A is to provide life-enhancing and life-changing opportunities for retired and semi-retired people.

Interactive public engagement events involving all age groups give society first-hand experience with science and nature. For the Fife Science Festival 2013 the Host Group PI, Dr Sue Healy, with a colleague from Social Anthropology working on human basket-making, developed and delivered a half-day session on nest building for families. This highlighted the benefit of collaboration among different research areas and demonstrates the relationship between human and animal behavior. Furthermore, members of Dr Healy's research group also visited a local primary school to teach the children about why and how birds build nests, after which the children were provided with material with which to build nests themselves in different 'environments' using different material. I will continue to develop and deliver such sessions during the Fellowship.

Public participation in scientific research, sometimes termed 'citizen science' is another way to engage and impact society. For the past 2 years, as part of the current her BBSRC grant, the Host Group PI has received over 150 blackbird nests sent from bird watchers around the UK in response to a call for nests placed in British Trust for Ornithology newsletters. These data on variation in nest structure in this species are nearly ready for publication. This citizen science nest collection project will continue in this grant however the target species will change as I am working with redpolls, a native British bird where the female builds the nest and incubates the eggs. 

Wider community impact with be achieved through collaborations not only with artists themselves but also though museums and galleries. The Roslin Institute is involved in a cross-disciplinary association with Edinburgh College of Art. Art students visit the Roslin Institute to produce artwork based on research including that of my proposed collaborator, Dr Simone Meddle. 

Very recent (April 2014) media interest suggests that research on how birds know what nests to build will continue to be of interest and value in impacting society. For example, the BBC featured a video on their news website of a nest-building pair of zebra finches from Dr Healy's laboratory. We expect our future work to continue to attract significant media interest.

Nest building leads to power cuts that cost Scottish and Southern Electrical &amp;pound;200K per year. Nest building on man made structures is a significant problem worldwide and increasing the understanding of decisions over nest material and site is likely to lead to the development of technology to reduce this problem.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-03-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>291637</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Several pieced of artwork were produced based conversation with me about my work, using pictures of my study animals</gtr:description><gtr:id>3BE97A1B-4A35-434E-B47F-87E87FA70696</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This event was part of a larger initiative at the University of St Andrews to highlight the work of women scientists.
