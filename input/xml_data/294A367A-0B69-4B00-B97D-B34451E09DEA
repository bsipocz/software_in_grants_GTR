Action</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/J005126/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Knowledge Exchange Hub Design In Action (KEH DIA) is a national network of organisations (academia and industry,) committed to working in effective collaborations, through the ethos of knowledge exchange to deliver a working model of multi-sector participation that meets the requirements for products, processes and services designed for the demands of tomorrows users. It will build economic capability through design-led innovation to ensure that Scotland can maximise its capacity to operate effectively and meet the imperatives of building new economies for future world markets. 

The aims of KEH DIA are to:
Engage design and mobilise entrepreneurial capacity in five key sectors of food, sport, ICT, rural economies and wellbeing
Develop a knowledge exchange model for innovation
Develop a collaborative partnership model for Scotland that builds upon existing public support mechanisms
Understand opportunities for growth in international markets 
Develop hard and soft metrics for the creative economy 

KEH DIA offers a genuine alternative to the existing approach to knowledge exchange, which is project-based and demand-led. It currently occurs in isolation and when the need for it has been identified. The KEH DIA is a unique proactive model of knowledge exchange, harnessing the strategic thinking capabilities of design and designers to work on problem identification through dialogue with multiple stakeholders, in order to envision multiple perspectives / scenarios for emerging issues and single complex problems. The core KE activities undertaken by the strategic partners include 15 'Sandpit' events (which is an extreme model for facilitating innovation) resulting in a minimum of 20 Small Grant Scheme awards to develop prototypes, 10-40 support grants for micro-enterprises to fully engage in the process, an interactive Design Portal, Virtual Incubator and a series of 40 Change Audit Grants.

The four Scottish art colleges - Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art &amp;amp; Design, Edinburgh College of Art, Glasgow School of Art, Gray's School of Art, University of Abertay Dundee, University of St Andrews, Creative Scotland, Cultural Enterprise, Scottish Enterprise, DC Thomson, and the V&amp;amp;A at Dundee are the key partners, working in conjunction with an additional 30 companies. These companies, range widely from independents to SMEs to multi-nationals and collectively our partners have pledged &amp;pound;1, 470, 563 in-kind support. They are drawn to the project by the KEH DIA's approach to participatory knowledge exchange with many more keen to engage with the truly collaborative approach that the Hub will take.

Developing strong networks between academic institutions and various companies to disseminate the research and working practices that arise as a result of the KEH DIA will be key to strengthening the creative economy and to embedding the innovative approach of design throughout these networks. KEH DIA will adopt a wide-ranging dissemination strategy working in partnership with all of its strategic partners to build understanding of design across Scotland for all audiences. It will also use a variety of visual means to articulate design as strategy for innovation; these will be distributed and exhibited across Scotland in a variety of traditional and non-traditional spaces to build momentum, visibility and an appetite to engage with the people and process that are design.

Design is the strategy for effective innovation through partnership and provides a model that places design excellence at the heart of its delivery, building an inclusive culture with design values, which will generate a perceptual change in the image of Scotland as a design driven culture. 

The legacy is to embed in each region in Scotland an innovation strategy, that demonstrates the transformational effect of design to a range of audiences, enabling insights gained to become an established framework for companies to use strategically as a tool for growth.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In Scotland, the general public have had little opportunity to gain knowledge of design. The DC Thomson partnership (international publishing company) to profile the design profession, designers and KEH DIA events on a monthly and weekly basis over a four-year period will alter this dramatically; visibility of design to increase understanding of design as a strategic approach to developing innovation and economic growth will advance public awareness and lead to understanding design as a means to beneficial change. Social and media strategies of all partners will be mobilised to maximise the reach of KEH DIA activities to further attract international/national partners, through global audiences and markets. The distributed model, under the guidance of the Steering Group, enhances national engagement with innovation through design, using a variety of strategies to ensure the widest geographical reach throughout Scotland, establishing an effective framework for knowledge exchange. The V&amp;amp;A at Dundee designed by the acclaimed Japanese architect Kengo Kuma, provides a world-class context and platform for engaging with audiences about innovation through design. 
The added value that the KEH DIA brings to public sector organisations is an internationalisation strategy for design-led innovation and the legacy of an archive and database for exposing Scottish Innovation (as process, product and service) in five strategic sectors - food, ICT, sport, wellbeing and rural economies. In addition to providing evidence to improve understanding of design-led innovation it offers a new methodology for complex, large-scale Creative Industries partnership collaboration where dynamic engagement with strategic public organisations and private companies over a sustained period of time is a given. This will lead to a change as to how and why we do business with design in traditional and non-traditional contexts for future economic growth. The quality of how we evaluate knowledge exchange will improve as new metrics are devised, tested and shared. The lessons learned will be made transparent and the new design tools will be shared via national/international dissemination and branding strategies. 
The private sector will gain insight into commercial opportunities of the HE research base and their evolving knowledge banks. The greatest benefit from KEH DIA, will be gaining un-paralleled practical insight into the value of design as a strategic tool for developing business growth, particularly economic growth. KEH DIA will have significant impact on entrepreneurial activities though its Small Grants Scheme, Design Portal, Virtual Incubator and Change Audit Grants. The 15 sandpit events for businesses to engage in extreme models of innovation for the effective resolution of complex problems and the stimulation of greater wealth present rare opportunities for genuine competitive advantage through ingenuity. In total 340 businesses will have the opportunity to exploit the knowledge of leading academics, meet and liaise with new colleagues from across Scotland in progressive dialogue. 120 companies will be offered the chance to receive intense design development support with 71 of these resulting in the effective undertaking of design-led innovation to develop their national and international markets. 110 new products, process and services will be created with 10 companies emerging, and 140 new jobs created over the four-year duration 
KEH DIA is a 'game changer'; for partnership collaboration, offering an effective approach to managing today's complex problems in an uncertain climate: it offers rigorous development of a meta-solution to a meta-problem via practical pathways. It will provide an ambitious model of innovation with relevance to the way we live today and with benefit to a range of stakeholders - large and small, young and old, public and private, national and international - in their commitment to creating an economically sustainable future.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>4129006</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>#include2 and #include3: Cryptocurrencies public engagement events</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9F27D093-3309-41EA-8F09-D97A1AA5B05C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Pre-Chiasma scoping events, delivered to enhance audience understanding and engagement in cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin etc.) and recruit potential applicants and participant to 'Creative Currencies' Chiasma in Feb 2015.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>574eeee209d594.05982410</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.designinformatics.org/node/337</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Reciprociti Artist Talk and Private View</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1264C46A-21A1-4B4C-B550-7F57E8A85924</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Can the most mundane of financial transactions be used as a force for good? Designer Patrick Stevenson-Keating tests the possibilities through his imaginary bank with its own notes, debit card and cash dispenser.

Reciprociti was commissioned through the Design Museum's Designers in Residence programme 2014 and will be the first time it has been shown in Scotland.
Alongside Patrick's installation will be the work of jewellers Jonathan Matthew Boyd and Adam Henderson which questions the perceptions of innate value by considering the materials, processes and concepts which determine it.

Guided by artist Rob Kennedy and curator James Clegg, delegates were welcomed to drop-in and contribute verbally and physically to a playful discussion about how modes of exhibition and display shape and manifest cultural, social, political and physical engagements within life.

Playtime tests the fundamental process of exhibition making by looking at how the manipulation of simple objects and basic materials can allow complex ideas to be shared in imaginative and accessible ways. Starting with an empty space and pile of cardboard boxes, the workshop will have seen a diverse group of academics and students challenged to play out and debate a number of games, applying the logic of a particular world-view to the subsequent spatial creations you will find presented in the Gallery.

Led by specialist 'game leaders' the project will provide insights into ongoing research from across the University and further afield. From animal behaviour to invisibility, from translation to tool-making, from cyborgs to lateral thinking, Playtime will overcome disciplinary boundaries and foster curiosity, fantasy and imagination. The content of the exhibition will only become known through its making, this process will reflect and encourage new forms of creative learning and interaction.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c9e3a4916d96.58868028</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ed.ac.uk/talbot-rice/exhibitions/future-exhibitions/rob-kennedy-acts-of-dis-play/playtime</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>A collaborative software development project in transfusion medicine</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8AFA975E-198E-4F04-888C-AFE816C4BEE4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The presentation allowed Karl Monsen to meet other PhD candidates in the area of Human Computer Interaction, and present his research to experts in the field.

Design from/with/by Data
 
The complex constellations of personal and shared devices that are connected to everyday practices that involve the transmission of data constitute openings to new markets in which different kinds of value are exchanged. In many cases we are becoming attuned to understanding how value is constructed as we use software: social media users are becoming aware of the many pros and cons of exchanging social values in Facebook, while Trip Advisor users understand the implications of their liking, disliking and commenting upon the economic values of hotels. However, as websites and apps become replaced by objects that we use in everyday life, such as making tea, taking a shower or getting on the bus, it is less clear how the flow of data that is derived from our interactions, constructs value and is 'traded' between services. This disjuncture in the flow of value - with and without humans in the loop - presents both opportunities and threats to people and institutions. This talk will explore the implications of emerging ecosystems and an agenda for designing human data interactions, that goes beyond the organization and understanding of data, toward the development of platforms that balance the values of all stakeholders within complex digital economic systems to offer a level of commensurability with a service.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c9f01fb7e7c4.49788034</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Undergraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>European Consumer Summit, Shaping the Consumer Policy of the Future</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2FF5E23B-6D75-41C6-AA36-486E9AD48BF2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The European Consumer Summit is an annual forum gathering key European and international policy-makers and stakeholders, including representatives from the European Parliament, governments and national authorities, consumer organisations, academia and business.

RISE Connect is a follow-up initiative naturally extending on the largely successful RISE Awards launched by the EPSRC in 2013 which paired a select number of scientists and engineers with individuals not connected with the world of science and followed the development of these relationships for an entire year.

The event was opened with a welcome note by Nicola Blackwood and Phil Nelson followed by an afternoon networking session during which several scientific projects and programmes showcased the diversity and high impact of research funded by the EPSRC.

What is the problem space we will address?
Participants to this charrette will explore design approaches for alternative ways of representing, communicating or conceptualizing economic values in everyday transactions. We address the impending opportunities that new digital economic models have for the parsing, exchange and representation of value within urban contexts. By sketching complex economic cycles, we will question how they expose power, exert control and offer incentives that distort the balance of the urban landscape.
Participants to this charrette will conduct design-based research to understand the affordances of money if it were to become software. After on-site explorations, we will generate, sketch and critically discuss possible scenarios teasing out different ways of conceptualizing value, such as transport companies being able to charge customers only if their train/bus arrives at a GPS location on time, or City Councils using micro payments as incentives for pedestrians who cross roads properly.

Which methodologies will be adopted?
Research methods based on participant observation and auto-ethnography will be complemented with software on mobile devices to generate &amp;quot;geofences&amp;quot; (virtual boundaries separating physical spaces) and associate them with economic values. Addressing and interrogating the principles of blockchain technology, participants will apply algorithms to physical spaces, experimenting with how the value of a digital currency may be altered by designing specific conditions.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>574ef19ad604d8.48520201</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://designandthecity.eu/programme/lab-of-labs/blockchain-city/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>UK Digital Economy Crucible 2016, London Skills Lab</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A6935B8A-B355-41C5-A42E-4BB7437310D5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited talk to discuss the roll of value constellations in mapping research relationships across projects.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c9e531ae8b93.78410605</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://cherish-de.uk/crucible/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Design in Action &quot;What Matters in Food Innovation&quot;</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>334C84DB-57C2-4825-9E5D-57A9095FBD81</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Bringing together a mixed audience of Academics, Designers and Biz/Enterprise individuals (Rowett Institute, SRUC, RGU, Elevator, Centre for Genomic Gastronomy, etc.) this workshop explored and identified &amp;quot;innovation&amp;quot; from a food perspective using the 25+ food-related ideas generated from the Design in Action Chiasmas (residential workshops) - 6 of which launched as Scotland/UK-based food enterprises.

Things2Things was a one-year-long project of the 3TU Industrial Design programs in the Netherlands that ran from January to October 2016. The project brought together a community of almost 50 professional designers and design researchers to explore the role of design thinking in creativity and innovation within the field of the Internet of Things. We have captured the key insights generated during the workshops in a booklet that we are launching at the Dutch Design Week, DRIVE Festival for Design and Innovation. 

Anticipating a culture of small scale, distributed manufacturing, the workshop envisions a scenario in which people receive not software suggestions, but material artifacts that anticipate their daily needs. Over a period of 3 months, three families will play host to three networked 3D printers that 'print' artifacts meant to aid families in their daily practices. During the 3 months, participants in the final workshop will use readings from families' calendars in order to design objects for the families, which will then be sent over the Internet to the 3D printers. During the workshop, participants will discuss, evaluate and create new design concepts in light of the diaries families are asked to maintain about their experiences with these unusual material artifacts.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c9e70b283dc6.90473275</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://things2things.nl/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Story Blocks</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AAC5DED3-FF57-45AD-8C76-E63185D3197A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This workshop is part of a series of events in which we will explore some of the principles of the blockchain in the context of storytelling.

Design from/with/by Data

The complex constellations of personal and shared devices that are connected to everyday practices that involve the transmission of data constitute openings to new markets in which different kinds of value are exchanged. In many cases we are becoming attuned to understanding how value is constructed as we use software: social media users are becoming aware of the many pros and cons of exchanging social values in Facebook, while Trip Advisor users understand the implications of their liking, disliking and commenting upon the economic values of hotels. However, as websites and apps become replaced by objects that we use in everyday life, such as making tea, taking a shower or getting on the bus, it is less clear how the flow of data that is derived from our interactions, constructs value and is 'traded' between services. This disjuncture in the flow of value - with and without humans in the loop - presents both opportunities and threats to people and institutions. This paper will explore the implications of emerging ecosystems and an agenda for designing human data interactions, that goes beyond the organization and understanding of data, toward the development of platforms that balance the values of all stakeholders within complex digital economic systems to offer a level of commensurability with a service.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c9e6622a3976.22547300</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=york-hci;9eb9c625.1603</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Co-Directed workshops at TUDelft, part of Design United.

The Chiasma educated me in some of the design methods that are out there and I know a lot more about design now than I did. I was coming from the business planning side with very strict procedures and I didn't, initially, know how to get my idea out there. The designers and creatives at the Chiasma inspired me to put my idea out there.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>574ab3d35c8919.03239592</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:url>http://www.uanwool.co.uk/</gtr:url><gtr:yearCompanyFormed>2013</gtr:yearCompanyFormed></gtr:spinOutOutput><gtr:spinOutOutput><gtr:companyName>URBAN FARMING COMPANY (SCOTLAND) LIMITED TRADING AS TABLEFARM</gtr:companyName><gtr:description>The Urban Farming Company is a pre-revenue start-up with an innovative smart edible plant growing system targeted at the children's market, TableFarm.

The business impact:
- August 2014, the first physical store opened for 2 days in Dundee's Wellgate shopping centre
- Opened by Dundee-based MSP Jenny Marra on Friday 8th August 2014
- Featured heavily on the STV News
- Over 700 people visited the shop
- Over 550 challenge cards were taken
- The Know Sugar website got over 600 hits with visitors from as far away as India.
- 100% of visitors to the shop reported they had enjoyed their visit and had learned something new
- Employs 5 (all designers)
- KNOW trademark registered

Professor Mike Press from the University of Dundee said: This event was a great demonstration of how well considered and executed service design can engage with people, build their awareness over a health issue and challenge behaviours. The design values were evident, the tools were very well designed and the whole concept well developed. However, without volunteers who were confident, clear and adaptable, the project would never have succeeded. Well done to the whole team.

Ewan MacPherson, founder Know Sugar Shop said - I'm fundamentally a design engineer, that's my long-term background. I also enjoyed art at school but in the bad old days I had to give it up to study more science and maths to become an engineer. That was then, I'm sure it's not like that now. In my career I've been shocked at the reactionary attitude we've had towards design often seen as a stick-on, add-on extra. It's not, it's fundamentally part of things. Design in Action opened up to me, which I hadn't really appreciated before, that service design was something to focus on as a discipline. It was a gradual thing but I began to see that it's really, really important. You can recognise poor service design - you can recognise poor service - as being all around us but without recognising that design has a part to play in improving that.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>574abd6f6ecb09.68156678</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:url>http://www.designinaction.com/news/news-dundee-hosts-sugar-shop/</gtr:url><gtr:yearCompanyFormed>2013</gtr:yearCompanyFormed></gtr:spinOutOutput><gtr:spinOutOutput><gtr:companyName>A FOX WOT I DREW LIMITED TRADING AS BAUM</gtr:companyName><gtr:description>iOS gaming app with a hand-painted art style and an interesting gameplay mechanic where players must use the power of the wind to carry a tiny droplet of water through the twisting branches of a tree; sliding down the bark, avoiding obstacles and blooming flowers.

Design in Action's Impact: (James Brown, founder of Beer 52) said - I guess I didn't know that much about Design to be honest. I could appreciate good design but - in the other start-ups I worked on before, they didn't invest in design as it was seen as a luxury, something that was nice to have but that you didn't need to have. I now realise that it's a must-have! At the beginning, we just wanted to get to market as quickly and cheaply as possible and the packaging wasn't right and hadn't been tested enough. We had a very short window to fix it - people were waiting for their beer and starting to get angry - and the designers in the team got to work testing various alternatives and doing drop tests. There were a few different boxes and we eventually found one that worked. The design process is a collective responsibility and is evident in the team - all input is welcome and there is no one decision maker. It is very much influenced by design methodologies and co-creation.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5739e8175a9271.87986881</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:url>http://www.beer52.com</gtr:url><gtr:yearCompanyFormed>2013</gtr:yearCompanyFormed></gtr:spinOutOutput><gtr:spinOutOutput><gtr:companyName>BYO.MYO LIMITED TRADING AS STONESOOP</gtr:companyName><gtr:description>A service to connect people who want to share a meal.

Design in Action's impact (Ninian Stuart founder of WoodWorks) said - In a sense, I saw design as a word where I wouldn't normally be in the same room as people who discussed it would be but I thought Chiasma was a very interesting process and I really enjoyed it. Being in a large room with so many designers and some of the language of design was quite new to me. I found it [the language] quite helpful and even parts that weren't design related, I found useful. The most challenging part for me was the 'Dragon's Den' type design process but it was very interesting. There was competition in one hand and collaboration in the other hand which was very stimulating.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>574abc3de40dc2.08224748</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:url>http://woodworks.org.uk/</gtr:url><gtr:yearCompanyFormed>2010</gtr:yearCompanyFormed></gtr:spinOutOutput><gtr:spinOutOutput><gtr:companyName>NAUTILUS BEAM LIMITED TRADING AS TUSI</gtr:companyName><gtr:description>Tusi by Nautilus Beam is a smartwatch chat app which features a unique keyboard interface that makes typing on tiny screens fast and simple.

Design in Action Impacts (Rebecca Thomson founder of Squidz): Before Chiasma, I wasn't someone who would call myself a designer every day but after working with Design in Action and learning about design thinking and the process, I realised I actually am a designer! Chiasma really changed the way I think about design. It changed the way I see myself and our company. The design thinking and process toolkit that you gave to designers [at Rural Economies Chiasma, 'Sustaining Rural Scotland' in Oct 2014] is something that we use for everything now. I think it's something that we did to a certain extent before, not consciously realising it was design thinking, but now we're much more conscious of it and make sure we go through that process much more on a conscious level which puts design as more of a focus on everything that we do. Developing ideas together, around a specific problem, provides an opportunity to come up with solutions together. If you have a business on your own, you don't have that sort of insight.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>574ab70915c2d3.69552777</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:url>http://hottapmedia.com/squidz-app-is-now-live-in-the-app-store/</gtr:url><gtr:yearCompanyFormed>2011</gtr:yearCompanyFormed></gtr:spinOutOutput><gtr:spinOutOutput><gtr:companyName>VITSEY LIMITED TRADING AS SHOPPING BASKET HEALTH CHECK</gtr:companyName><gtr:description>The Shopping Basket Health Check is a snapshot assessment of how healthy a selection is for a given shopping purchase.
