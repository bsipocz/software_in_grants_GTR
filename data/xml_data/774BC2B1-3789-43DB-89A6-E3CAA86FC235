The impact of strong tropical cyclones (TCs or Typhoons) is of crucial importance and leading to major losses in southern China, especially in Guangdong Province. 

One way of mitigating severe, negative impacts on different sectors of society is the development and application of financial instruments for risk transfer and adequate response. Beside classical (privately organised) (re-)insurance solutions, since recently, parametric insurance solutions have been developed for test cases in some areas, as e.g. by SwissRe Beijing Branch, our practitioner partner. 

The challenge SwissRe Beijing Branch is now facing, is to achieve a reliable structure for the parametric insurance programmes designed and underwritten for TC index triggers for Guangdong Government. 

The first major challenge is the regionalised effect of Typhoons, leading to difficulties in the robust estimate of losses per sub-region or prefecture level in Guangdong province, which will lead to under- or overcompensating for specific prefectures. 

The second major challenge is the very limited and instationary nature of meteorological information (as well as for past losses) available for extreme Typhoons.
Consequently, the design of parametric insurance has shortcomings in the assessment of the real hazard frequency and intensity on one side and on the other side suffers from limited availability of historic loss (insured and economic loss) to calibrate the impact. 

INPAIS aims to improve the hazard risk assessment and thus to improve the response trigger points for Guangdong province. Ultimately, this will lead to increased rapid response and recovery after a Typhoon strikes. 

To address challenge one, the problem of missing regional assessment of losses in affected prefectures, INPAIS will apply and further develop the successful tool to objectively measure and quantify storm severity (Storm Severity Index, SSI) based on the WiTrack algorithm from University of Birmingham. This hazard assessment will allow for an integrated characterisation on event basis. Detailed information per Typhoon system (footprint, area affected in relation to damages; wind speed information relative to climatological background; track location; etc.) will be provided. Our co-investigator, Prof. Ye, will collect information of losses on prefecture level from archives of the Chinese Meteorological Agency, only available in local sites and in Chinese. 

To address challenge two, the problem of small samples of physically consistent meteorological data available and thus leading to less robust assessments of the real hazard risk and its uncertainty, the objective tool will be applied to the operational forecast archive TIGGE (THORPEX Interactive Grand Global Ensemble) in a climatological approach. The TIGGE dataset consists of multi-model ensemble forecast data from 10 global Numerical Weather Prediction centres, available for the last 10 years. This will allow to estimate return-levels of Typhoons out of a sample equivalent to some 40,000 to 50,000 years. 

The INPAIS outputs will be used: 
A) Scientifically: To inform about more realistic frequency-intensity distributions of the integrated hazard Typhoon (dry - wet) on a regional scale. This will lead to improved estimates of uncertainties of hazards on seasonal to decadal time scales necessary for output:
B) Financial Instrument: to improve the trigger points of the existing parametric Typhoon insurance for Guangdong province. This will led to improved matching of damages/losses and cover existing. 

This will also tackle the problem of under- or overcompensating in specific regions and the potential development of improved distribution mechanisms, ultimately enabling increased rapid response and recovery.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>INPAIS will impact on two levels:
Firstly, it will improve the scientific assessment of damage relevant tropical cyclones in the West-Pacific. INPAIS will build an event set of extra-tropical storms, to increase the sample size of Typhoon events to derive robust measures of return levels (distribution fitting problem), by expanding the sample of real events by physically consistent cases out of the multi-model ensemble TIGGE. As the forecast system consists of 10 forecast suites with about 20-50 members each, we sample Typhoons out of about 40,000 to 50,000 years. This will allow for much longer, physically consistent meteorological data available and thus lead to a more robust assessment of the real hazard risk and its uncertainty. This has also the potential to impact on other companies view on Typhoon risk by introducing physical consistent event sets. 
Secondly, INPAIS will achieve impact especially to an improved insurance cover for Guangdong province, but will also set the scene for the application of the developed hazard risk assessment and the financial instrument tool to further provinces in China (e.g., Fujian, Hainan) or further regions in SE Asia (Vietnam, Laos, etc.) affected by disastrous Typhoons. In this sense, INPAIS will be a game changer in the further development and application of parametric insurance solutions for meteorological extremes (like Typhoons) in SE Asia. 
INPAIS will impact on the governmental approach to allocate the pay-outs out of the financial product in case of a disaster. Incorporating information about spatial distributions of potential needs out of pure meteorological information close to the event unfolding, will add valuable information to the rapid response chain in governmental and societal actors. This could also trigger a new social science research approach to analyse and to improve current distribution structures and practices. 
Further on, INPAIS will impact on training insurance professionals. As part of ESPRE, the Academy of Disaster Reduction and Emergency Management (ADREM) was founded at Beijing Normal University in 2006 and co-sponsored by both Ministry of Civil Affairs and Ministry of Education. To meet China's needs for disaster reduction and risk governance and emergency management, ADREM is also authorized to be the education and training centre for both researchers, policy makers and professionals in the fields of disaster risk science and practice. The methodology and products developed by this project will not only provide new tools for ADREM to better train young professionals in insurance and reinsurance business but also improve their capabilities of using financial products.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>222312</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/R014264/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Climate &amp; Climate Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>396591D1-8226-43A9-991D-8E0D265D99D0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Regional &amp; Extreme Weather</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>D640D1B8-B141-4DFC-BCD3-CEADD848A918</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>GCRF</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
