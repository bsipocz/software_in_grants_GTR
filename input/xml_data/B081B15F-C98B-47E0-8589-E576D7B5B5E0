Standard practice is to use one of several scanning probe microscopes (SPMs), principally atomic force microscopy (AFM). The principle of an AFM is simple: a horizontally oriented cantilever with a very sharp tip is moved across the object of interest, allowing the capture of a three dimensional topographical image. However, the low forces and fast timescales of the fundamental inter-molecular events of interest in bio-medical sciences, generally lie far outside the operational range of commercial AFMs, which typically require several minutes per image. Thus, while AFMs can provide sub-molecular resolution of biomolecules under physiological conditions (cf. electron microscopy which uses a vacuum) there are two significant disadvantages of AFMs still to be overcome.- slow imaging rates: A typical 256x256 pixel image takes 60 seconds to produce.- excessive interaction forces during imaging: A significant challenge to imaging biomolecular interactions is that the forces typically present between the probe and the sample disturb or even damage the biomolecules.To counter these issues, we will combine the latest advances in control theory with the novel SPM instrumentation, currently in development in Bristol, to produce a new scanning probe microscope capable of imaging these fragile samples without damaging them: Thus, Bristol's transverse dynamic force microscope (TDFM) will represent a breakthrough in both SPM instrumentation and the study of biomolecules.In Bristol's TDFM, the probe is aligned perpendicularly to the sample surface (rather than parallel to it, as in AFMs) and oscillates in the plane of the sample. The amplitude of oscillation decreases as the tip-sample separation distance decreases. The amplitude of the probe oscillation can be used as a measurement signal to control the probe-sample separation with sub-nanometer precision. When using this control method, at no point during scanning should the probe come into contact with the sample surface.Novel control methods will create a high-speed TDFM (HS-TDFM) by-controlling the fast movement of the cantilever height (z-motion)-controlling the fast placement of any (biological) specimen to be observed (x-y-motion)-estimating sample-cantilever forces, e.g. Van-der Waals forces, to better understand the wealth of measured information for faster and simpler fusion &amp;amp; processing of data obtained from the HS-TDFM.Before any of this is possible, the TDFM will be redesigned to incorporate highly precise sensor technology and to obtain the best possible dynamic behaviour. The modern control approaches will include linear robust control approaches, nonlinear sliding mode control, nonlinear adaptive (neural network) control, modern estimation/observer techniques using sliding modes, and adaptive principles.The challenges will be to-achieve practical control at bandwidths above 1MHz;-understand &amp;amp; exploit the nonlinear HS-TDFM dynamics for better data interpretation;-develop novel estimators/observers combining the paradigms of adaptive and sliding mode methods, for signal and parameter identification;-incorporate novel estimation and control approaches for improving the control system of the HS-TDFM.The resulting HS-TDFM will be a true non-contact imaging technique capable of comparable spatial resolution and lower interaction forces than AFMs. The HS-TDFM will display pico-Newton force-sensitivity and provide a wealth of information from direct observation of the interacting biomolecules. It will collect multiple images per second as required for observing biological processes. This will not only benefit life-sciences but also support SPM users in material science, producers of nano-sized systems, and in nano-electronics, e.g. microprocessors.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-07-09</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-29</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>262782</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>IMECHE Public Talk</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F7877B72-20E9-4194-AC6E-D8E384E80F45</gtr:id><gtr:impact>&amp;quot;Engineering and its impact on biomedical research at nano-scale&amp;quot;, 11 March 2015 19:00 - 20:00, talk held by Dr Guido Herrmann (P-I), Dr Toshiaki Hatano (Postdoctoral Researcher) &amp;amp; Gavindu De Silva (Research Intern)

These talks are usually attended by engineers working and living within the region of Bristol and Bath. In addition, post-graduate and post-doctoral researchers, undergraduate students, members of other faculties within the University of Bristol attend. This is an ideal way of disseminating the research outcomes. This talk has sparked discussions across the Faculty of Engineering and the University.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dc6e34b1fde2.04369016</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://nearyou.imeche.org/near-you/UK/Western/Bath---Bristol-Area/event-detail?id=10247</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talks on STEM subjects and current engineering research, e.g. the transverse dynamic force microscope, to primary, secondary and A-level students</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>864FB8B3-EE54-4B32-843D-247C50AFFCF6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Professor Stuart Burgess, one of the co-investigators, has been highly active in disseminating engineering and engineering research to schools to increase the interest in STEM and in particular in engineering subjects among primary, secondary and A-level students. During the following talks, the work on the high precision control and mechanical design problems for the Transverse Dynamics Force Microscope have been particularly mentioned:

- St Mary's, http://www.stmaryscalne.org, a secondary / A-level girls' school, SN11 0DF, Calne, Wiltshire, 28 Jan 2014
- Clifton High School, http://www.cliftonhigh.bristol.sch.uk, a primary, secondary &amp;amp; A-level school, BS8 3JD, Bristol, 10 March 2014
- forthcoming: Emmaus School, http://www.emmaus-school.org.uk, a primary school, BA14 6NZ, Wiltshire, 23 June 2014


Professor Stuart Burgess has been very successful with these presentations at schools. As a result, he has hosted summer placement students within the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Bristol. It is expected that similar summer placement activities will take place in the near future.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>546090798c7ee1.53518449</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Dissemination of the results on both a formal and informal level within the two universities (University of Bristol and University of Exeter), has led to extended interest. In particular, the Institution of Mechanical Engineering (IMECHE) supported a talk at the University of Bristol on 19 March 2015 and generated the first significant impact on engineers within the region of Bristol and Bath and other researchers within the Faculty of Engineering and university wide. Moreover, a public talk at schools have created further interest in STEM subjects.</gtr:description><gtr:id>82EDC8EB-6FAD-4BE6-8D28-A3C80292D945</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56def90f2bd422.26514583</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Practically validated methods 

- A new improved, robust and more user friendly set-up of Bristol's Transverse Dynamic Force Microscope (relating to Objective 1) 

- Development of a high speed x-y stage and positioning control (Objectives 1 and 2) 

- Creation of a robust controller for non-contact scanning based on a secondary z-height signal (Objective 2) 

 - Improved control robustness after a redesign of existing controllers (Objective 2) 

- Development of several practical procedures for creating a family of dynamic ordinary differential equations characterising the behaviour of the TDFM cantilever, starting from an accurate spatio-temporal approach (partial differential equations) and using measurements captured at a high sampling frequency from the TDFM rig. This is significant for easy design of advanced control-engineering based estimators and control laws. (Objectives 2 and 4) 

- Creation of a real-time capable algorithm for the estimation of unmeasurable shear forces resulting from the cantilever interacting with a fluid layer above the specimen(Objective 4)

- Real-time identification of viscosity and elasticity coefficients within the fluid layer above the specimen (Objective 4) 

In addition several other new methods have been validated in simulation (and possess solid theoretical underpinnings) but have not yet been implemented on the TDFM: 

- Non-raster scanning approaches (relating to Objective 4) 
 
- An adaptive approach for cantilever amplitude control which allows implicit estimation of the tip-to-sample distance (relating to Objectives 2 and 5) 

Journal papers are under review or are being prepared with currently available results. We have addressed in our work all the 5 originally planned objectives. Further work on Objective 5 (Enhanced robust and adaptive control of the HS-TDFM cantilever system using observer based methods) is being carried out by a new PhD student Kaiqiang Zhang. Objective 5 is the most challenging and the most 'blue sky' of all the objectives. A slight change to the original objective, to the more general theme of 'nonlinear robust multi-variable control methods', was needed, as we understand now all requirements for control better. Note that the completion of the project was delayed for more than one year in 2012 by the extended construction work on a major building next to the Nano-science and Quantum Information (NSQI) Centre of the University of Bristol. The NSQI houses the experimental system, as it is, in the UK and world-wide, one of the most advanced nano-science research centres with its vibration reduced working environment. Much of the initial work in 2012 (although intense) was preparatory and directed towards redesign of the force microscope, while learning practical skills necessary for the effective use of the force microscope started only in 2013. This unplanned delay has certainly had an effect on the morale of the team. Moreover, the resignation of a researcher at the University of Bristol during that initial period in 2013 was not beneficial. (This researcher left for personal reasons.) It should be understood that the transverse dynamic force microscope is a probe microscope built from first principles. Thus, the hardware and in particular the control software has also been built in house using the most powerful FPGA-based control implementation equipment system on the market at the time of start of the project. Complete practical realization of objective 5 will require additional, upgraded FPGA-equipment. This fact has made the project challenging and exciting. Thus, in any respect, the team is very happy to have achieved the majority of the targeted objectives (while addressing them all), of which many additional results are to be published soon.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Mr Kaiqiang Zhang, who worked as a research intern on this project, has successfully (co-)authored 5 conference and journal papers for this project. As a result, he obtained a PhD studentship from the University of Bristol (update of status as of 15 March 2017: 3 journal and 3 conference papers). He started his PhD research in March 2015 on advanced nonlinear control algorithms for Bristol's nano-precision devices such as the Transverse Dynamics Force Microscope under supervision of Dr Herrmann, Professor Miles and Dr Massimo Antognozzi. In preparation of further impact and the application for new funding, further actions on outcomes of the project are: The Transverse Dynamic Force Microscope has been successfully used for analysis of artificially engineered proteins (SAGE - Self-assembled peptide cages). This is a first collaboration with the Department of Chemistry: Professor Dek Woolfson is working on Protein design and its application in bionanotechnology and synthetic biology. This is a result of discussions in a funding oriented multi-disciplinary, cross university initiative at the University of Bristol has been successful (Long-term BristolBridge initiative): The objective is to use the transverse dynamic force microscope for non-contact scanning of biological specimen and the cell interior. Further discussions with the Infection and immunity research group, in the School of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Bristol are being carried out. For instance, the sliding-mode based shear force detection method is a relatively generic approach with many other potential application areas and could be used in a larger scale device for viscosity and elasticity characterisation of viscous fluid layers. This has potential for investigating joint fluids in animals. This is a more speculative outcome of the discussions at the BristolBridge event. As a separate device, the development of the x-y stage for the force microscope has created a significant pool of expertise and knowledge in the design of electro-mechanical x-y stages, the use of laser-interferometry for position x-y measurements and the design and implementation of related controllers. Plans are underway to use this knowledge for projects targeting a higher technology readiness
