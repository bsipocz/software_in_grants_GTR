In animals, plants and fungi (such as the budding yeast model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae) every cell contains two copies of each chromosome: one inherited from the mother and one from the father. During the specialised cell division called &amp;quot;meiosis&amp;quot;, HR occurs between these chromosome pairs producing gametes (eggs and sperm) that each contains a unique combination of the parental genes. Meiotic HR is initiated by numerous DNA breaks spread across all the parental chromosomes. Meiotic cells use HR to repair these DNA breaks to create so-called &amp;quot;crossovers&amp;quot; (COs) and &amp;quot;non-crossovers&amp;quot; (NCOs), both of which are important for genetic variation in individual gametes, and therefore essential for biodiversity and crop breeding. COs are also essential for accurate chromosome segregation during meiosis, by preventing aneuploidy (a type of genome instability characterised by gametes with an incorrect number of chromosomes), which is a common cause of infertility and genetic disorders such as Down Syndrome. HR is also critical to repair errors in the DNA arising spontaneously or induced by the environment, and HR defects can confer genetic instability, which can then trigger cancer development.

A central step of HR is the processing of DNA breaks by various enzymes that degrade one of the two DNA strands of the DNA double helix, generating short regions of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). This process is referred to as &amp;quot;resection&amp;quot;. These ssDNA regions are used by evolutionarily conserved repair enzymes (called RecA, Rad51 and Dmc1) to search for similar DNA sequences present elsewhere in the genome. These similar sequences are used as templates from which to copy, and thereby repair, the DNA breaks.

The initiation step of resection (engaging and commiting the DNA end to be repaired by HR) is well characterised, but the mechanisms that switch off resection, and the link between resection length, genome stability and genetic variation is poorly understood. This is despite a number of compelling indications that resection length will impact genome stability and genetic variation. For example, clusters of mutations identified in whole-genome sequencing of malignant tumors are linked to DNA damage occurring on the ssDNA that arises during resection. Furthermore, our unpublished work indicates that deregulated resection is one of the major risk factors associated with aberrant recombination during meiosis, generating imbalanced chromosome rearrangements that reduce fertility.

In this proposal we will use advanced whole-genome technologies in the budding yeast model organism to examine how DNA resection termination is regulated at all locations in the genome. DNA breaks activate checkpoint pathways that delay cell division until the DNA is repaired. We will study how resection is regulated by the checkpoint pathway, and how structural features of the chromosome affect the resection process at different locations across the genome. Importantly, we will use advanced genetic methods to examine how changes in the extent of resection influence the mechanism of HR, with particular interest in the impact on genome stability and genetic variation.

Our work, &amp;quot;discovery science&amp;quot;, will be of fundamental importance to understand if, how and why resection, and more broadly HR, control fertility, biodiversity, genome stability and cancer.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Homologous recombination (HR) is a critical step in gametogenesis for many organisms, enabling the creation of genetically diverse haploid gametes. HR is also used in cycling cells to repair errors arising during and after DNA replication. A central step of HR is &amp;quot;resection&amp;quot; where DNA ends are processed by various nucleases to generate short regions of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). While much is understood about resection initiation, how resection is terminated and the link between resection length, genome stability and genetic variation is largely unexplored. To examine how resection termination is regulated, we will study the budding yeast model organism during meiosis when hundreds of discrete Spo11-induced DNA breaks arise at well-characterised hotspots. We will first investigate the role of the DNA damage checkpoint (which appears to inhibit excessive resection). Next, we will investigate how structural features of the chromosome influence resection by mapping the resection termination positions at each Spo11 hotspot and comparing these positions to maps of nucleosomes, histone modifications/variants (methylation, acetylation, H2AZ, etc) and chromosome structural features (Rec8, Hop1, etc). This analysis will allow us to determine whether resection is uniform across the genome, and identify chromosome features that may influence resection termination. To understand how resection influences the HR process (efficiency, fidelity, pathway used), we will monitor HR patterns genome-wide in mutants causing either hypo- or hyper-resection defects using whole-genome sequencing of haploid meiotic products. This method will also allow us to map aberrant non-allelic HR events typical of genome instability. Our study will be of great value to researchers investigating the mechanisms that give rise to mutation and genomic instability (for example, in mammalian cancer cells), and genetic variation (for example in crop breeding and evolutionary studies).</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Impact summary:
Our proposal will investigate the fundamental relationship between the extent of ssDNA formation during meiotic recombination (resection) at different locations across the genome and the underlying features of the eukaryotic chromosome such as: histones occupancy, variants and modifications; position relative to centromeres and telomeres; active transcription (and orientation); and structural features such as cohesin and condensin; and meiosis-specific DNA binding factors such as the RMM complex. In parallel we will determine the impact of resection deregulation on the outcome of meiotic recombination and genome stability.

Our proposal is &amp;quot;discovery science&amp;quot;, and as such will have the greatest and most immediate impact on academic researchers working in the related fields of: 1) Meiosis research, 2) Genome Stability and Cancer Research; and also in 3) Synthetic biology. There are clear avenues for our research and future research arising from these three areas to make a wide impact. I outline those below:

Crop science and food security: A major concern for the 21st century is in providing adequate food for a growing world population in a warming (and increasingly erratic) climate. Research is underway in both academic and industrial agricultural companies to improve crop yield and resistance to stress. Many important agricultural crops such as tomato, maize and barley have non-uniform rates of recombination across the genome, creating large haplotype blocks that diverge very little during breeding. By understanding better the molecular mechanisms that influence genetic recombination distribution and recombination type (gene conversion versus crossover) it will become possible to generate novel crop variants that have beneficial characteristics for future food production.

Health, cancer, fertility and ageing: Past advances in medicine and access to health services have dramatically improved the lifespan of many people in the world. However, longer lifespan is associated with an increased risk of cellular malfunction leading to various types of cancer. Many of the proteins and processes involved in homologous recombination, HR, (and conserved within budding yeast to humans) are essential to repair damage to DNA and thereby to aid cancer avoidance. Our proposed work on investigating the factors that modulate ssDNA formation (an essential step in HR) will therefore lead to potential impacts in healthcare and cancer treatment regimens. Because ssDNA is always present at telomeres, and because telomere length is associated with ageing, our studies will also help to understand better the cellular ageing process (and may in the future provide novel ways to extend cellular lifespan). Finally, reproduction in sexually reproducing organisms requires the formation of haploid gametes. HR is essential, not only to generate diversity within gametes, but also to enable haploidisation via reductional chromosome segregation during the meiotic division. Our work will help to understand potential molecular causes to meiotic recombination failure leading to infertility.

Biotechnology industry: Synthetic biology is a growing field, with the potential to develop radically new types of cells and simple organisms with unique and useful properties, which could change the future of science and the biotechnology industry as a whole. One way of generating large DNA constructs is via the recombination and stitching together, in vitro or in vivo, smaller synthetic nucleic acid fragments. Our basic work on understanding the ssDNA phase of HR may influence protocols in this area, particularly in relation to generating large synthetic chimeric chromosomal additions, and rearrangements.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>373062</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>National Center for Scientific Research (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique CNRS)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>France, French Republic</gtr:country><gtr:department>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique Marseille</gtr:department><gtr:description>LLorente &amp;amp; Garcia</gtr:description><gtr:id>74E0C0B0-BC0F-4868-BFD7-45C6B1B2FB3A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In progress</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56ddb650e52fe0.83076728-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Sharing bioinformatic skills and methods</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Sharing bioinformatic skills and methods</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Eggs and bacon</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E5376535-E8AC-46A0-AA7F-BD1A48C89A3B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A play about genetic variation, DNA replication and the perils of eating bacon.
