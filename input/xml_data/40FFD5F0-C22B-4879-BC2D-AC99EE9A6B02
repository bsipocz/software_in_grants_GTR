As well as having intrinsic cultural and aesthetic value, they provide the resources that support wildlife. It is likely that global warming will alter the distribution of individual plant species and the composition of communities. For example, increasing temperatures will affect the time plants flower and changing rainfall patterns may increase drought stress in the summer. Climate change may even allow invasive plant species (for example, ones that are currently adapted to a Mediterranean climate) to establish in the UK. One way that has been used to predict how the distribution of species may vary in response to climate change is to determine the climatic range of the areas where a species is currently found now and then to predict how that range may shift. However, this approach is limited and is only useful on a continental scale, because it doesn't take into account all the other factors that might determine whether a plant can survive in a locality such as land management or competition from other plants. For many years, scientists have been studying how plants adapted to cropped fields (weeds) respond to these factors in order to advice farmers how to manage them. This proposal will use the information available on weeds to help develop a general understanding of the impact of climate change on plant communities at a regional scale. We will do this by combining computer models that are able to predict the response of plants to the environment and management with simulations of what the weather might be like in the future. The work will help us to decide what is most important in controlling which plants grow where if the climate changes - is it the weather or the way land is managed? We will also be able to predict whether, for a farm in a given location, the plants that are able to grow in the crops will be broadly similar to now under climate change or if there will be changes. This may have consequences for the way weeds are controlled and the biodiversity they can support.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>There is concern about the potential impact of climate change on the diversity of the UK flora and the fauna it supports. It is likely that the increasing temperatures, changing rainfall patterns and increased likelihood of extreme events predicted by Global Climate Models (GCMs) will alter the current distribution of indigenous plant species and may provide opportunities for non-indigenous plants to invade. The conventional approach to predicting these changes has been to combine species distribution models (based on current habitat range) with GCMs to model the shift in the bioclimatic envelope. However, the species assembly that ultimately occupies a locality will also depend on local conditions, land management and biotic interactions. All of these drivers are likely to respond to climate change and, if the resulting shift in plant functional diversity is to be predicted, they all need to be included in the analysis within a simulation framework based on climate change scenarios predicted for a selected region. Because an extensive literature on the eco-physiology of weeds and their response to the environment and management already exists, arable plant communities are an ideal model system for addressing this fundamental research challenge. We will combine a process based eco-physiological model of weed population dynamics and competition with a stochastic weather generator to predict the shift in the realised niche of indigenous UK arable plants and the potential for non-indigenous species to invade on a regional scale. In addition, the ability of species to adapt and the potential shift in plant functional diversity will be predicted using data on intra and inter specific variability in plant functional traits. The approaches and principles developed in the proposal will be instrumental in improving the predictive understanding and manipulation of plant communities in a range of habitats under climate change including grassland systems.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>291717</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Weeds can be a major problem for crop production in the UK with weed killers making up the largest part of the total pesticide load applied to fields. Weeds reduce crop yield by competing for light, water and nutrients as well as reducing crop quality. The scale of this impact will be dependent on the competitive balance between the crop and the weeds and this 'race for resources' will be a determined by an interaction of the biology of the competing species and the local growing conditions (weather and soil type). It is likely that the crop-weed balance, and hence yield loss, will shift under climate change. However to predict these changes requires a complex analysis of the impact of different weather on the biology of the crop and the weed. We brought together expertise in weed biology, computer and climate science to meet this challenge. A model of interplant competition, Sirius 2010, was developed that was able to predict how competitive a weed would be in specific location based on current or future weather. This model can be used in a number of ways. 
Firstly, it was applied to the question of whether plant species that are currently common weeds in farmers' will become more or less of a problem under climate change. The most serious weed in the UK is currently black-grass which is found in most winter wheat fields and is becoming increasingly difficult to control because it has developed resistance to a number of chemical weed killers. The model was first used to recreate the current distribution of the weed using present-day weather data and then to predict how the impact of the weed might change under climate change. Black-grass is very similar to winter wheat - they are both grasses and have a similar period of development, although black-grass flowers a few weeks earlier than the crop. In many respects, therefore, they responded in a similar way to changes in future weather. However, black-grass has shallower roots than the crop meaning, that in dry conditions, it is at a disadvantage as the crop can access water unavailable to it. It was predicted that climate change would result in more frequent and severe droughts in the summer and that this would shift the competitive balance in favour of the crop, reducing yield loss. This effect was predicted to be most apparent on sandy or chalky soils that tend to be drier.
Secondly, the model is a powerful tool for predicting the potential for invasive weed species to establish in UK fields in the future. There are a number of these species that are common in crops grown more commonly on the continent such as sunflower and maize. Examples of these exotic weeds include velvetleaf, barnyard grass and common ragweed. Ragweed may be a particular concern because hayfever sufferers tend to be highly sensitive to its pollen. We collected data on some of these species growing in UK conditions and are working towards a prediction of the risk of them becoming a problem in the UK if the weather or types of crops grown changes. Finally, the software developed in this project will be useful for predicting the change in weed communities under environmental change. As well as being a problem for crop production, weeds also provide resources for farmland biodiversity and there is a need to balance their negative and positive roles in the environment. Ways are being explored of using the model in a more general way to assess the relative impact of future changes on damaging weeds and beneficial plants.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Models developed in this project are available for academic community for their research.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>99115A11-0FE9-433C-8E1C-D87CF6A084F4</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56b897c9f150f8.86658434</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>LARS-WG is a model simulating time-series of daily weather at a single site. It can be used:

1. to generate long time-series suitable for the assessment of agricultural and hydrological risk;
2. to provide the means of extending the simulation of weather to unobserved locations;
3. to serve as a computationally inexpensive tool to produce daily site-specific climate scenarios for impact assessments of climate change.

LARS-WG version 5.0 includes climate scenarios based on 15 Global Climate Models (GCMs) which have been used in the IPCC 4AR (2007). This large dataset of future climate projections was produced by leading modelling groups worldwide who performed a set of coordinated climate experiments in which GCMs have been run for a common set of experiments and emission scenarios. Multi-model ensembles allow to explore the uncertainty in climate predictions resulting from structural differences in the global climate model design as well as uncertainty in variations of initial conditions or model parameters. The new version also improves simulation of extreme weather events, such as extreme daily precipitation, long dry spells and heat waves. LARS-WG has been well validated in diverse climates around the world.</gtr:description><gtr:id>E7E6B6F3-C30C-4702-B22E-22A825C404F2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>LARS-WG has been used in more than 65 countries for research and in several Universities as an educational tool.
