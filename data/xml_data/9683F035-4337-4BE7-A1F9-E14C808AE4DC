water</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/J005894/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>A great number of chemicals used in everyday manufacturing processes have been identified as being capable of disrupting the normal function of the hormonal system in both humans and wildlife; collectively these are known as Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDC's). The catastrophic damage caused by the release of EDC's in to the aquatic environment is well documented and a clear casual link has been established between the release of EDC's and an alarming reduction in the population of molluscs, crustaceans, insects, fish and amphibians both in the UK and elsewhere. Strict legislation is in place to ensure that significant amounts of EDC's do not reach the aquatic environment; this however, places a great financial burden on wastewater producers. Conventional wastewater treatment facilitates are ill designed to cope with such chemicals hence there is a real need to develop new technologies capable of rapidly and efficiently degrading EDC's in water.
Recent interest has focused on the use of Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOP's) to degrade EDC's in water. Methods such as the Fenton reaction and Photocatalysis are effective; however, the need to provide external oxidising agents greatly reduces their cost-effectiveness. This study considers plasma, the fourth state of matter, generated directly in-contact with liquid to produce an abundance of highly oxidising species at the point of need. Cutting edge electrical and optical diagnostics in combination with innovative engineering techniques are used to explore the interaction between the highly non-equilibrium plasma phase and the liquid phase. The relationship between plasma excitation mechanism, electrical efficiency, reactor design and EDC degradation efficiency will be established and compared directly with other AOP's reported in the literature. 

By developing this transformative technology there is a real opportunity to addresses a pressing environmental challenge, whilst simultaneously delivering scientifically excellent, industrially relevant research. This adventurous, multidisciplinary research project lies at the interface between physical and environmental sciences and aims to bridge the gap between the EPSRC signposted area of 'Matter far from equilibrium' and the 'Living with environmental change' priority research area.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This adventurous research proposal is at the interface between physics and environmental science. It has real potential to not only deliver high-impact science in these disciplines; but have a lasting impact across a broad spectrum of scientific activity through the development of novel diagnostic techniques and methods. Beyond academic impact, water pollution has a detrimental impact on both the economy and our quality of life. The transformative technology developed in this research project has the potential to not only benefit, but, capture the imagination of both the general public and UK industry. 

The short term focus of the project will be on delivering scientifically excellent research and disseminating widely and effectively to maximise academic impact. The project comprises of three work phases, it is envisaged that each work phase will produce high-impact publications. To maximise this impact leading journals will be targeted in the fields of electrical engineering, applied physics, chemistry / chemical engineering, and environmental science. As the project progresses the PI will use the critical mass of quality research produced to actively seek out new funding opportunities; allowing the PI to explore this vital research area further in the future.

In the medium term the focus will be on engaging UK industry and maximising industrial impact; a key driver in this activity will be the projects current industrial partners. Interaction with a leading consultancy to the wastewater industry provides access to a vast customer base of potential end-users; two-way engagement with this these will act as a guide to shape future research projects. The development of a transformative technology to cut the cost of water-treatment directly enhances the competitiveness of UK industry. To maximise this impact it is envisaged that the numerous outcomes will be patentable; these will be explored under the guidance of the University of Liverpool Partnerships and Innovation office.
 
The long term impact of the proposed research could be very significant. Our quality of life is inextricably linked to the aquatic environment; in the face of rising population and increased industrialisation the challenge of water pollution is very much in the public spotlight. Any technology to minimise the release of harmful chemicals is likely to capture the imagination of the general public. To ensure the PI is equipped with the skills necessary to deliver maximise the long term impact of the project funds are to be requested for the participation in a public engagement course training course.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-01-19</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-01-20</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>92245</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Institute Josef Stefan</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Slovenia, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Plasma-liquid interactions</gtr:description><gtr:id>A0046811-2576-4D75-BA63-B859F7A6601A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Two joint papers are being written and two research visits (funded by various EU COST actions) have taken place.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dc4663eb43f1.28402740-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The team at IJS are leading in the analysis of plasma treated materials, by using my plasma sources to conduct their experiments I am being provided with a wealth of results and insight.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>A strong collaborative link between my research team and the leading surface science research group at IJS has been formed.

It was found that degradation efficiency for pulse modulated cases, i.e. those with duty cycles of less than 100 %, was significantly higher than cases in which continuous sinusoidal excitation was employed. It was demonstrated that degradation efficiency can be more than doubled when using a pulse modulation duty cycle of 25 % compared to continuously generated plasma. The period of the pulse modulated signal was determined to not have a significant impact on degradation efficiency or gas phase ozone production. 

Measurements of ozone evolution in the reactor show that in every case the concentration of ozone reaches a peak shortly after plasma ignition, followed by a period of decay; with the rate of decay being linked to an increase in plasma temperature and elevated NO production. Although the peak ozone concentration was found to be lower in the pulse modulated cases, the decay rate of ozone in the reactor was also found to be lower than that observed in continuous cases, with the 25 % duty case showing only a very slight reduction over the duration of the test. 

Improvements in the degradation efficiency when using pulsed modulation can be attributed to: (1) The sample having a longer residence time in the reactor thus allowing for more absorption of long-lived reactive species from the gas phase, (2) the reduction of gas heating leading to an increase in O3 production rate coupled with reduced thermal decomposition of O3 and (3) the reduced production of NO and subsequent poisoning of the Ozone formation process. Pulse modulation period did not have a significant effect on the degradation efficiency, suggesting that the plasma species in the reactor have already reached equilibrium within 2 ms (the lowest period considered). 

The pulse modulated test cases also produced a markedly reduced concentration of nitrites, nitrates and other ionic compounds when compared with continuous-wave tests as determined by ion chromatographic analysis, pH and conductivity measurements. With the concentration of nitrate in water being up to 22 times lower when exposed to pulse modulated plasma compared to continuously generated plasma. Conductivity and pH measurements confirmed that the low duty cycle cases produced a smaller concentration of ionic compounds compared to the continuous cases. From the results of this study it is clear that manipulation of the electrical excitation, specifically via pulse modulation, is a highly effective means to significantly enhance the efficiency of plasma mediated breakdown of organic contamination in water whilst simultaneously improving the quality of water such that it is suitable for discharge without further processing.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The fundamental science uncovered on this project has been a exploited in several other RCUK priority areas, including food security (InnovateUK funded, led by Sainsbury's - plasma treatment of fresh food for shelf-life extension) and healthcare (EPSRC funded EP/N021347/1 - establishing a centre for plasma microbiology - with a focus on biofilm decontamination in collaboration with Public Health England).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>2BF1141F-4860-45BD-8A5D-00E036A2BF5E</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545cb11f4739f3.98296096</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5D357CE2-8BBE-4281-A148-2FE969C632A9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Turbulent jet flow generated downstream of a low temperature dielectric barrier atmospheric pressure plasma device.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Scientific reports</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/0c4fd3fee0dc8108f4000a64cc985a83"><gtr:id>0c4fd3fee0dc8108f4000a64cc985a83</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Whalley RD</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2045-2322</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>585d50e62a85a7.40217970</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D7DA7D13-A415-445C-8FBA-CB1F73F71E04</gtr:id><gtr:title>modification of chromatography adsorbents using cold atmospheric pressure plasmas</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Applied Physics Letters</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/da7c34bb7bba2e5415e2ebe89e7dd803"><gtr:id>da7c34bb7bba2e5415e2ebe89e7dd803</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Olszewski P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d038038fbb10d3</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>230288D0-4D89-48BA-B68F-D9C0AC1CF3F5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Optimizing the electrical excitation of an atmospheric pressure plasma advanced oxidation process.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of hazardous materials</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/da7c34bb7bba2e5415e2ebe89e7dd803"><gtr:id>da7c34bb7bba2e5415e2ebe89e7dd803</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Olszewski P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0304-3894</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>545cae42e8e329.67584227</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>88F5E754-8552-45D7-AEF4-F346C8C5D28A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Cold plasma - Decontamination for the food industry</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/1c267c000bc9e5f7c837914b16796fdc"><gtr:id>1c267c000bc9e5f7c837914b16796fdc</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bayliss D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56dc40c8d0ffc5.96788426</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8FD42848-906A-4AB2-BD7E-7C4A92A3DD1A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Influence of food intrinsic factors on the inactivation efficacy of cold atmospheric plasma: Impact of osmotic stress, suboptimal pH and food structure</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Innovative Food Science &amp;
