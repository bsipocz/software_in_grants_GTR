Sadly, diseases like cancer put a tremendous strain on the sufferer and their families and a significant burden on our laden healthcare system. Indeed, as our population continues to age the prevalence of diseases such as cancer and the need for improved diagnostics and therapies will only increase. On the other hand, there is cause for optimism as the early detection of cancer dramatically improves the outlook for sufferers. This has been clearly demonstrated by successful screening programs for breast and ovarian cancers that have had a dramatic impact on the survival rates for sufferers.
One of the most promising tools in our battle to understand and identify cancer at an early stage comes in the form of small chemical modifications of our DNA, referred to as our epigenome. There is increasing evidence that the epigenome is both a critical indicator and influencer of the progression of cancer. These chemical modifications to genetic material change throughout our lives in response to many factors including ageing, the environment and disease. Our expanding knowledge in this area of research is driving the development of diagnostics that allow an individual's epigenome to be monitored as a predictive, prognostic and diagnostic marker of disease. However, epigenomic information is typically difficult and expensive to read-out and as a result there is a pressing need for the development of methodology that streamlines this process.
This project will develop biochemistry, analytical and state-of-the-art imaging solutions that underpin the realization of this goal. My group will prepare combinations of small molecules (cofactors) and specially selected enzymes that can be used to track and test epigenomic modifications in our cells. Our ultimate aim is to work with medical and clinical scientists to develop and apply simple tests that will improve our ability to make informed decisions about the treatment of individual patients.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research that will be carried out in this project will develop the physical science that will underpin future research in biology and medicine by providing new tools for studying the epigenome. The technologies we develop represent an alternative to the current approaches for epigenomic analysis; bisulfite conversion and antibody-based DNA capture (immunoprecipitation). These research tools represent a significant annual market of approximately 600M USD. By establishing the chemistry behind DNA capture using the methyltransferase enzymes and by optimising this for the subsequent analytical pipeline (i.e. DNA sequencing, microarray analysis or real-time quantitative PCR analysis) the work that is carried out in this project has the potential to establish itself as a genuine alternative to either bisulfite conversion (which requires relatively large amounts of material and significant work-up prior to analysis) or antibodies (which show bias for heavily methylated regions of the genome). The long-term goal for the science that is developed in my laboratory and proven with researchers in the medical field is to find a partner or licensor(s) with whom we can work to ensures the methyltransferase-directed labelling is able to reach the scientific community worldwide.
The development of new approaches for studying and isolating the targets of epigenomic modifications has the potential for development as a companion diagnostic for the pharmaceutical industry. Key to generating this impact is that my research group develops the network of industrial collaborators that will enable this. This will be achieved, in the first instance, by establishing the performance of the tools I develop through research collaborations and subsequently by reaching out to industrial partners, for example, to GlaxoSmithKline, who are a partner of the EPSRC-sponsored Physical Sciences for Health Centre for Doctoral Training in which I work at Birmingham.
All of the commercialisation work I undertake will be carried out in partnership with Alta Innovations at the University of Birmingham. Alta offers the use of office space, support and, potentially lab space through the new BioHub laboratories adjacent to the University campus. Furthermore, the University has strong connections with Abingdon Health, a diagnostics development company and a possible future partner for the commercialisation of a clinical assay that is developed using the chemistry that will underpin this project.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1000806</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>10B0048C-5CAA-4BF1-9811-9C29542E14B5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Methyltransferase-Directed Labeling of Biomolecules and its Applications.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/bd20b67a264ab30d991bf316fb440a92"><gtr:id>bd20b67a264ab30d991bf316fb440a92</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Deen J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1433-7851</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58b57c76318726.95568630</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5320E40B-5710-4139-B2FE-3FC87E6F9F33</gtr:id><gtr:title>Die Methyltransferase-gesteuerte Markierung von Biomolek&amp;uuml;len und ihre Anwendungen</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Angewandte Chemie</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/bd20b67a264ab30d991bf316fb440a92"><gtr:id>bd20b67a264ab30d991bf316fb440a92</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Deen J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fe3798036c3.31047840</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1831A3A7-67AB-49E8-96AA-BFFDEA43AD23</gtr:id><gtr:title>Methyltransferase-directed covalent coupling of fluorophores to DNA.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Chemical science</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/65582d713276ffca02232e0d5cbd35a5"><gtr:id>65582d713276ffca02232e0d5cbd35a5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lauer MH</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2041-6520</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a35291b2e0fb5.96118652</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/N020901/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F442B6BE-8B89-4C01-8D3B-E8A4D320B672</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biomolecules &amp; biochemistry</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>863FC58A-7217-42EA-B076-663F2D770BB8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical measurement</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>60EBB420-734E-4DB5-B0F2-65A1115A27F8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical synthesis</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>98EA7556-1427-44F9-84F3-BF99B7207302</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Analytical Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>0B9701E7-D17F-4963-82DA-B3926A65B50A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biological &amp; Medicinal Chem.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>02567418-12CB-462E-9092-530C6E63B359</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical Biology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>454398F2-57A6-4959-8845-0F248CF4D5C4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical Synthetic Methodology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
