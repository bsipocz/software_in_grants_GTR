They present the two regions with some common challenges, including rising economic inequality, heightened migration, regional imbalance and population ageing.

What are the implications of these social changes for the life course of individuals and families? China and Europe do have different histories, social institutions and cultural traditions. Do they create different kinds of risks, vulnerabilities and opportunities for their citizens? What can Chinese and European scholars, policy-makers and other stakeholders learn from each other's experiences as they formulate policy responses to the common challenges confronting them.

In this project, we use recent, high quality, large-scale and nationally representative household survey data to explore the experience of individuals and families in China, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK. Moreover, because all respondents of these surveys have been followed through the years and were interviewed multiple times, we gain a deeper insight into how their experiences change over time.

We focus on the key issues that confront people at four stages of their life: (1) child development and schooling, (2) transition to adulthood, (3) security and well-being in middle life, and (4) intergenerational support and well-being in later life. 

This project will produce harmonised and fully documented data sets which will be deposited in an international data archive. This will become a key international data resource for scholars and policy-makers who wish to understand the changing population and family dynamics in China and Europe.

In addition, a number of doctoral students and postdoctoral scholars will receive training in this project. These junior scholar as well as the senior scholars of the project will work closely together, fostering Chinese and European collaboration in research on understanding population change.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research will inform public debates on many social challenges that are facing China and Europe, e.g., rising inequality, increased migration, regional imbalance, and population ageing. Because we cover almost the entire range of the life course in this project (from child development and education, through the transition to adulthood, and the middle life, to intergenerational exchange and well being in later life), our research should be of interest to a wide range of government departments and non-governmental organisations. 

For example, in the UK alone, our work on social mobility and on the inequalities in child development and educational attainment would be of interest to the Sutton Trust, the UK Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission, and the Department for Education. Similarly, our work on later life well being and intergenerational support would be of interest to organisations such as AgeUK and Grandparents Plus. We will actively make contacts with these organisations, and their counterparts in China, Germany and the Netherlands.

The findings of this project will also be relevant to organisations that are interested in Europe--China relationship in general, such as the Great Britain China Centre. Our project will also speak to international organisations that are concerned with cross-national population issues, such as the Population Unit of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe.

By publicising the emerging research findings of our project through the media, members of the general public might also benefit from a better understanding of some of the common population issues facing both regions, and the similarities and differences of the policy responses in China and Europe.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>409552</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We show that levels of income inequality is very much higher in China than in Western countries. We also show that there is considerably more income mobility in China than in the West. Although income mobility might reduced income inequality over time, it turns out that China is much more unequal than the West in terms of long-run income difference. There is also much greater income volatility or insecurity in the short term in China. The findings of our research suggest that thirty years into the market reform, inequality of income and of educational opportunity in China has become a very serious issue and policy challenge in China.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We are continuing our research, presenting our results in academic conferences and sending them to scholarly journals. This should stimulate academic interests in this area of research. At the same time, we are trying to organise meetings with think tanks and policy colleagues to ensure that our research could speak to their concerns.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>74F7642A-AF04-457E-A346-36CAB2CD04F0</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dd9a1ee4eb97.01048510</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>A major goal of the project is to harmonise and document household panel survey data from China (from the China Family Panel Survey) with comparable European data source (e.g. UK's Understanding Society and the German SocioEconomic Panel).
