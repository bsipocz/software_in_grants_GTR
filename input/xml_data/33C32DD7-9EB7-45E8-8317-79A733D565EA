and arthritis</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/I02770X/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This project aims to provide new label-free detection and imaging tools for minimally invasive diagnosis of arthritis and heart disease. When biological tissue is illuminated with light at appropriate wavelengths, certain naturally occurring biomolecules can absorb this excitation energy and emit new radiation called fluorescence. By analysing such autofluorescence signals, it is possible to detect particular biochemical or structural changes in tissue, which may be exploited to detect the early onset of diseases such as arthritis, heart disease and cancer, which can cause changes in the concentration, distribution and interaction of these autofluorescent biomolecules. Unfortunately, biological tissue is heterogeneous, typically containing many kinds of biomolecule in unknown quantities that can interact with autofluorescence measurements. It also strongly scatters optical radiation, making quantitative fluorescence measurements unreliable. It is therefore desirable to analyse tissue autofluorescence in a way that avoids artefacts arising from unknown variations in molecular concentrations and light intensity. One way to do this is to exploit the fact that excited molecules can radiate fluorescence at different rates, depending on the particular biomolecule or on how it is interacting with its surroundings. By observing the fluorescence decay times (lifetimes), it is possible to distinguish different chemical species or different molecular environments that can correlate with different tissue structures. Although this technique is attracting increasing interest in laboratory-based research, there is very little work, to date, on translating this to clinical practice. Here, we propose to develop fibre-optic-based probes that clinicians can use to measure fluorescence lifetimes in situ in biological tissue samples or live subjects including patients. We will also develop a fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) system that will be able to rapidly map the spatial variation of autofluorescence lifetime, which can provide diagnostic functional images for medical research and clinical practice.We will develop one fibre-optic autofluorescence lifetime (AFL) probe to be applied to changes in tissue matrix components associated with arthritis, which leads to loss of joint function and pain in ~9 million people in the UK's aging population. Arthritis is caused by the degradation of cartilage in our limb joints. Currently, there is no way to examine the integrity of cartilage tissue without invasive surgical biopsy. In preliminary work, we have shown that degraded cartilage exhibits significantly different AFL compared to healthy cartilage. Here we aim to investigate how AFL measurements can provide label free information on the structure and health of cartilage. We would also investigate the prognostic value of FLIM arthroscopy of cartilage in early rheumatoid and osteoarthritis and monitor the effect of drugs applied to repair cartilage.A second AFL probe will be applied to the study of heart disease - the major cause of death in the developed world - which is characterised by abnormalities of heart muscle energetics. Energetic inefficiency accelerates further disease progression, manifesting as changes in the mechanical and electrical properties of the heart. Two important autofluorescent molecules, NAD(P)H and flavins, are intimately involved in metabolism but, apart from our preliminary results presented below, no AFL measurements have been made in situ in live heart tissue. We aim to investigate how cardiac AFL can provide a quantitative label-free readout of the metabolic state of the beating heart and to identify signatures of disease through AFL measurements and FLIM of cardiac tissue matrix adaptations associated with heart disease and electrical disturbances. These label-free readouts of diseased heart tissue could provide a novel means to determine treatment of patients following a heart attack.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project aims to provide new non-invasive tools for improved patient prognosis and treatment, particularly for arthritis and heart disease, and so addresses the needs of the aging UK population. The autofluorescence lifetime (AFL) technologies to be developed and validated would find other biomedical applications, e.g. for research, diagnosis and monitoring of therapies in cancer, inflammation, wound healing and any condition where label-free readouts of tissue matrix properties or metabolism are useful. They could also be used with fluorescence labels, including in genetically manipulated live disease models to provide readouts of signal pathways for drug discovery. Other bio-applications include tissue engineering, stem cell culture and bio-reactors. Some of these are being addressed by lab-based FLIM microscopy but our fit-for-purpose technology should lower the cost and increase the potential for real-world deployment. AFL technologies are applicable in the pharmaceutical sector, e.g. to test drugs in patients and animals - permitting longitudinal studies and therefore reducing the required numbers of animals. For agriculture, AFL may be useful to study plant disease, to monitor the effects of chemical intervention and to assess crops before harvest. For food safety, AFL may help detect dangerous bacteria or decomposition. Beyond the life sciences, our proposed instrumentation could be used to rapidly assess, in situ, devices such as OLED's and photovoltaics, including during manufacturing for quality control. The most direct impact of this project is envisaged to be medical research addressing the label-free detection, diagnosis and monitoring of arthritis and heart disease, although we anticipate patient-orientated follow-on studies and clinical trials to deliver new clinical tools. We also note the valuable training of project research staff. For both arthritis and heart disease, there are unmet needs for minimally invasive functional and spatially-resolved readouts of biological tissue to improve patient prognosis and more effectively target treatment. For arthritis, the proposed AFL instrumentation could enable the early detection of disease - before significant irreversible cartilage degradation. This would help the NHS budget by reducing the number of joint replacements and significantly improve patient quality of life. The ability to monitor cartilage integrity in situ also enables monitoring of potential therapies such as inhibitors that block the action of cartilage-degrading enzymes that otherwise can only be studied using invasive biopsy and/or the sacrifice of animals at each endpoint. Currently there are no such therapies targeting cartilage degradation available for arthritis. For heart disease the use of AFL to read out changes in metabolism and tissue matrix properties could address the current inability to accurately predict which heart disease patients are at risk of both sudden cardiac death from malignant arrhythmias and progressive mechanical deterioration and death from 'pump failure'. Better patient selection and targeting of expensive treatments, such as implantable defibrillators, arrhythmia ablation and the emerging stem cell and gene therapies, would significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce costs to the NHS. Because this AFL instrumentation represents a relatively cost-effective add-on to current clinical diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, it presents new commercial opportunities, e.g. for medical device manufacturers. Kentech Instruments Ltd, in particular, are keen to develop products for clinical AFL imaging based on their gated intensifier technology and will work with us to establish the requirements for clinical devices. For the single-point AFL fibre-optic probe, we are seeking commercial exploitation partners and want to use the data from this project to validate the clinical applications and strengthen our case for commercial investment.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>949099</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Kentech Instruments Ltd</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Kentech Instruments Ltd</gtr:description><gtr:id>1EED0838-9781-4CC3-BE89-D3738E2C0250</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Joint publications

Autofluorescence is the emission from naturally occurring fluorophores in biological tissue that can excited with ultraviolet or visible radiation. These instruments can resolve tissue autofluorescence with respect to wavelength and can also measure the decay time of this emission, which typically occurs on a nanosecond timescale. This combined autofluorescence spectral and fluorescence lifetime information can provide information about changes in tissue matrix properties, such as scarring (which is manifest by an increase in collagen) or degradation of collagen such as occurs during osteoarthritis. These instruments can also read out changes in cellular metabolism, which can be used to study the function of the heart or can be used to identify cancerous tissue. 

The technology used to make these measurements is based on spectrally resolved time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) following excitation with gain-switched picosecond diode lasers. Essentially these instruments deliver ultraviolet or blue ultrashort optical pulses via an optical fibre that excites autofluorescence which is collected by other optical fibres incorporated into the same optical probe. This emission is spectrally filtered and sent to time-resolved detectors to allow us to measure the decay profiles of the autofluorescence signals resulting from the pulsed excitation. The system we have developed consists of compact instrumentation that fits on a small trolley and plugs into a laptop computer. 

We have applied one of these instruments to study heart disease and particularly the changes in tissue autofluorescence following a heart attack. Through preclinical experiments using rodent models, we have established that our instrument can be used to detect scarring and changes in the energetics of the heart tissue. If this could be implemented with human patients, our results suggest that the clinicians could gain valuable information about how a specific heart recovers after a heart attack - which could inform the treatment regime of that particular patient. The system also has the potential to provide a readout of the metabolic health of a heart in real time during open heart surgery.

We have also applied one of these instruments to studies of the degradation of cartilage associated with osteoarthritis. First we showed that our instruments could provide quantitative readouts of controlled degradation of cartilage tissue in vitro and then we applied the instrument to ex vivo animal and human tissue and showed that we see a change in the autofluorescence lifetime of the cartilage when it degrades. This is important because clinicians currently lack a means to diagnose osteoarthritis before significant symptoms are presented, by which time it is usually too late for any effective treatment. Our instruments could potentially be used to help diagnose osteoarthritis earlier and to monitor the effectiveness of new treatments. 

These optical fibre-based probes provide single point measurements and so do not yield information about tissue structure or sub-mm scale spatial variations in the tissue properties. For exploratory diagnosis and screening applications, we therefore developed a wide-field fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) endoscope system that can acquire maps of autofluorescence lifetime cross a field of view of a few mm. We showed that this was able to differentiate between normal tissue and cancer in ex vivo tissue. Such experiments usually require bulky apparatus but we developed a compact trolley-based FLIM endoscope system that can be used for clinical or preclinical imaging with a handheld optical fibre-coupled imaging probe. 

We also studied the autofluorescence lifetime signals in a novel automated FLIM microscope where we showed that the change in lifetime of cellular autofluorescence could be used to read out the response of the cells to anticancer drugs.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our single-point instruments and the wide-field FLIM endoscopes can be used to provide label-free optical molecular contrast to study a range of diseases including cancer, heart disease and osteoarthritis. Our results indicate that these instruments can provide signals that permit diseased tissue to be identified and this could be used for diagnosis and screening, e.g. using &amp;quot;optical biopsy&amp;quot;, or to guide conventional biopsies. They could potentially be used to assay the response of specific patients to particular therapies and therefore to stratify patients for &amp;quot;personalised medicine&amp;quot;. 

The next step is to translate the preclinical and ex vivo results to clinical trials in humans. We already have the instrumentation in place and so the next studies must concentrate on obtaining the data required to obtain ethical and regulatory approval. The key issue is that there is no data on hazards or regulation of light dose to internal tissues. Our instruments typically present lower intensities and therefore lower hazards than sunlight and are well within the safe exposure limits for skin.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0D0BD57B-487B-480E-88DA-2D8ADF00CC94</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545bac8d806d08.44056826</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>729F6D8D-7578-47C3-9ECF-C8B6A79F3D56</gtr:id><gtr:title>Characterisation of new gated optical image intensifiers for fluorescence lifetime imaging.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Review of scientific instruments</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e1a40add9ce569ce7cb64fd3d39b1681"><gtr:id>e1a40add9ce569ce7cb64fd3d39b1681</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Sparks H</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0034-6748</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58c96a7d843460.36299457</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1C2F1F92-6410-4830-AD64-344E10203A83</gtr:id><gtr:title>Fluorescence lifetime imaging across the scales - Plenary Lecture LALS 2014</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/bf7ae13e2e627786ac8dd105322f1b02"><gtr:id>bf7ae13e2e627786ac8dd105322f1b02</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>French,PMW</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>56dcb16c145158.09547535</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>31944250-9483-446B-85A6-184AED9B3D51</gtr:id><gtr:title>Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging for Biomedicine</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/fe0ca69d98568622e5c24beb8f244db6"><gtr:id>fe0ca69d98568622e5c24beb8f244db6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>French P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-55752-999-2</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>545bab25897179.41071921</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>365B9ECC-2A38-4C73-BA67-03E6FFF5EBD6</gtr:id><gtr:title>Correction Approach for Delta Function Convolution Model Fitting of Fluorescence Decay Data in the Case of a Monoexponential Reference Fluorophore.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of fluorescence</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/67867328dc81ae04f3981ac91baadc3a"><gtr:id>67867328dc81ae04f3981ac91baadc3a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Talbot CB</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1053-0509</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>585d4e25ddd2f5.14824978</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9CFCBA4F-5DCF-4200-9852-177829905B30</gtr:id><gtr:title>186&amp;acirc;?
