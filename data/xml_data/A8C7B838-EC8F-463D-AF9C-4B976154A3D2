&lt;p>To address this need, this project aims to provide proof-of-concept for an online tool prototype, which assesses the skills and competencies of business incubator managers, as well as the performance and impact of business incubators, longitudinally.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>To this end, a sample of 30 incubators (approximately 10 per cent of the total UK population) will be selected to reflect a cross-section of incubation circumstances, so that incubators with a social inclusion, community and regeneration objectives are included.The managers of these incubators will be interviewed face-to-face (30 interviews will be conducted).These interviews, in conjunction with non-participant observation of using the online tool and consideration of the incubators? policies and strategic plans, will be undertaken to test and fine-tune the prototype.Through this process, a database containing comparable information about the incubators? management, performance and impact will be populated.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project will serve as a catalyst for nurturing a community of incubation management practitioners, which will be using the online tool to align itself to best practice&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-03-11</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-01-09</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>83144</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop 2 - A Tool for Assessing &amp; Benchmarking Business Incubation Management Practice, Performance and Impact</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:id>116EE966-DBF2-4B99-AF61-4A1A9F698634</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Demonstrating work-in-progress and obtaining feedback on the intermediate formulation of the assessment and benchmarking tool</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-481079183.96692652aecb8e0</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>An online tool for Assessing and Benchmarking Business Incubation Management Practice, Performance and Impact</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F31572A2-E25A-4A60-821D-0C1AC9E31620</gtr:id><gtr:impact>There is a pressing need among various stakeholders, including practitioners, academics and policy makers to create a credible mechanism that enables the assessment of business incubation management against best practice and the evaluation of performance and impact of business incubators, longitudinally. To address this need, this provided proof-of-concept for an online tool, which simplifies the collection and presentation of the data needed to assess and benchmark business incubation management and performance against best practice, over time. This assessment and benchmarking tool comprises thirty-six indicators corresponding to six key domains of business incubation inputs, processes and output performance. Thirteen indicators out of these are focused on outcome performance, centred on the added value and impact of business incubation. The tool features three performance categories (Developing - Advanced - Leading) with established thresholds. However, the impact of contextual factors (e.g. variation in levels of demand, business support landscape and regional entrepreneurial dynamism) is taken into account when assessing the added value (output performance) and impact of business incubation. It is envisaged that this project will serve as a catalyst for nurturing a community of incubation management practitioners, which will be using the resultant online assessment and benchmarking tool to align itself with best practice. This is strengthened by the fact that this tool has been developed jointly by Aston Business School (ABS) and UK Business Incubation (UKBI), the professional body for the business incubation industry in the UK.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-102199073.976091182b2d19b2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>An online tool for Assessing and Benchmarking Business Incubation Management Practice, Performance and Impact</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8D35BE45-4E87-4612-8DC8-C0D2F368A14A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>There is a pressing need among various stakeholders, including practitioners, academics and policy makers to create a credible mechanism that enables the assessment of business incubation management against best practice and the evaluation of performance and impact of business incubators, longitudinally.
