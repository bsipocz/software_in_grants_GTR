In 2003 the PI published findings from a study of surrogate mothers who were interviewed one year following the birth of their surrogacy child. Whilst the study found that surrogacy can result in positive experiences for women, no studies have addressed its longer-term consequences. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>The proposed study will follow-up this original sample almost a decade later and will examine the relationship between the surrogate and the commissioning parents and surrogate child, the attitudes and feelings of members of the surrogate's family, and the motivations of women who engage in repeated surrogacy arrangements. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>Surrogates, their partners and their children will be interviewed and asked to complete questionnaires examining psychological state and family functioning. Similarities and differences will be examined between genetic (where the surrogate is the genetic mother of the child) and gestational (where the commissioning couple are the genetic parents of the child) surrogates and between surrogates who were previously known and unknown to the commissioning couple. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>The findings will be of relevance to families, clinicians and other professionals involved in surrogacy and will inform policy and legislation nationally and internationally.&lt;br />&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>189216</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Surrogacy in the UK: the experience of surrogates and their families</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>21EE02A3-DA71-45A5-80AD-26B8A01E2683</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited to speak at the first international conference on surrogacy held in Paris.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58907dd8c55782.35891934</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Surrogacy law: a call for change?</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8156916D-69A9-4BB6-A393-47634EE0D51B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This article written for bionews discussed findings from the study related to surrogacy law, including how surrogates viewed surrogacy law, whether they had concerns about how surrogacy is carried out, and whether they could recommend improvements.

Furthermore, no studies had evaluated how the children of surrogates are affected by their mother's decision to be a surrogate. Semi-structured interviews and questionnaires were administered to 34 surrogates, 11 of their partners and 36 of their children.

This study found that overall, the long-term health of surrogate mothers was good and they were not experiencing psychological problems. Those surrogates who were in a cohabiting relationship scored average or above average for relationship quality. The majority of surrogates recalled positive experiences of their surrogacy arrangement and most continued to stay in contact with the couples and the resulting child. The frequency of contact varied, with some surrogates maintaining very frequent contact and others not seeing the family at all. Most were happy with the level of contact they had with the family they helped create; it was only when their expectations of contact were not met that surrogates reported feeling disappointment. All surrogates who had no contact with the child were happy for the child to contact them in the future.

We found a high proportion of surrogates had carried out surrogacy a number of times, the average being 3. This did not appear to impact their psychological health. Reasons for carrying out further surrogacy arrangements included wanting to complete a family, (i.e. by providing a sibling for a child whom they had also gestated), and wanting to help other childless couples to have a child. 

No differences were found between surrogates who had used their own egg for the surrogacy and those that had used the couple's gametes. Contrary to previous studies which have found surrogates undergo either traditional (where the surrogate uses her own egg) or gestational surrogacy (where the surrogate does not use her own egg), this study found that a quarter of women had carried out both types of surrogacy, and their reasons for doing so appeared to be based on their circumstances and those of the couple they wished to help.

Surrogates' partners and their children were generally very supportive of the surrogate's involvement in surrogacy. The vast majority of the surrogates' children viewed surrogacy in a positive light and some mentioned how proud they were of their mother. 

Overall, contact between the surrogate and her family, and the parents and child created by surrogacy, was determined by the strength of the relationship between the different parties involved rather than the gestational and genetic connection between them. The findings from this study will inform further research into the experiences of surrogacy for surrogates and intended parents.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The research findings will be of benefit to surrogates and their families in the United Kingdom and elsewhere as well as to intended parents thinking of surrogacy as a route to family building. The results of this study are also of importance to professionals involved in surrogacy by informing them of the issues that are of relevance to surrogates and their families. The research findings have been disseminated in a number of ways. The results have been published in peer reviewed journals and in book chapters in the UK and abroad and have been presented at a number of scientific meetings targeting medical professionals, counsellors and other professionals involved in surrogacy and infertility. Furthermore, the results have been presented at academic conferences to interdisciplinary audiences. The research findings have been made available through a number of different formats including podcasts, reports and articles. A project report was compiled which was sent to all participants of the study and data were presented to surrogacy organisations targeting surrogates and intended parents. We plan to continue to disseminate findings in the months ahead.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>493F2B97-486B-4D35-8BC9-D7C350BF471A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-6312027216.2482395b2f2eefc</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Member of NGDT Advisory committee</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2D5768EA-D641-47F2-99BA-A8A56F528238</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5460e8abbfc825.27008390</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8B991B26-19CD-488F-A20D-520879CE2602</gtr:id><gtr:title>Children of surrogate mothers: psychological well-being, family relationships and experiences of surrogacy.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Human reproduction (Oxford, England)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/1031247048f021a8836d2b7fe99e7b2f"><gtr:id>1031247048f021a8836d2b7fe99e7b2f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Jadva V</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0268-1161</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cf9ff9f3c4b4d0</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F269AFFF-2F1D-4C1D-85E9-55C3FBE4B3DC</gtr:id><gtr:title>The long-term experiences of surrogates: relationships and contact with surrogacy families in genetic and gestational surrogacy arrangements.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Reproductive biomedicine online</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/438748d0310aa6c238fe4e81614d2441"><gtr:id>438748d0310aa6c238fe4e81614d2441</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Imrie S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1472-6483</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>542bd61e37c412.15459334</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AB247397-4D01-4A0D-A1B7-2B791985A83A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Relatedness in Assisted Reproduction - Families, Origins and Identities</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/1031247048f021a8836d2b7fe99e7b2f"><gtr:id>1031247048f021a8836d2b7fe99e7b2f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Jadva V</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781107038288</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>56cdb7bc3262f4.10969466</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>969CC50B-2612-4FC3-9B27-76D68C09F6CF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Surrogate mothers 10 years on: a longitudinal study of psychological well-being and relationships with the parents and child.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Human reproduction (Oxford, England)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/1031247048f021a8836d2b7fe99e7b2f"><gtr:id>1031247048f021a8836d2b7fe99e7b2f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Jadva V</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0268-1161</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>55f6d1cfa9c2c3.48602765</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>DB760C0B-7D67-4B0E-80CB-E7B7ED34BA9E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Surrogates and intended parents in the UK</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Medical Law and Ethics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/1031247048f021a8836d2b7fe99e7b2f"><gtr:id>1031247048f021a8836d2b7fe99e7b2f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Jadva V</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a7334f2eb17c7.03696469</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/I009221/1</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-061-25-0480</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
