&lt;p>The tested model proposes that support for terrorism arises from the complex interplay of social identities, associated appraisals (eg, relating injustices committed against one's group) and emotions, the perceived ability of one's group to deal with injustices, and the efficacy of potential collective action strategies. Characteristics of the social context (assessed using census data and indices of responses by other group members) are expected to exert effects on psychological variables by affecting intergroup and intragroup processes, social norms, and beliefs about how others see one's group. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>This theoretical model will be tested in the context of support for terrorism among British Muslims, whose attitudes towards violent extremism have been subject to much speculation and in the recent years. The research is planned in three phases:&lt;/p>

Policy and practical implications of our research have primarily focused on providing new insights into the psychological factors involved in attitudes towards normative and non-normative political action and on understanding the role of social context in these processes. Our initial findings have been discussed with members of the non-academic community and relevant stakeholders and we hope that our findings (once finalized) will have a more direct societal impact as we further develop these links and disseminate our findings.</gtr:description><gtr:id>8F331152-8C19-457E-9606-36D2F5B062AE</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>54648602b74724.79717440</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project has made theoretical, empirical, and methodological contributions to the field.
Theoretical: Our research was the first to apply theoretical models of collective action to the issue of support for political violence. It extended existing models by demonstrating that, although similar psychological processes are involved in non-normative as in normative collective action (i.e., injustice and efficacy appraisals, emotions), there are also important differences (e.g., contempt rather than anger predicts support for non-normative action, low rather than high general efficacy predicts support for non-normative action). 
Empirical: Although some of the investigated mechanisms were described in anecdotal examples (i.e., low efficacy as a predictor of violence), these had not been investigated quantitatively. Our research has extended the field by empirically examining predictors of support for non-normative action. Moreover, our findings help to dispel some widely held beliefs, such as that anger is an important predictor of collective violence, or that living in highly segregated or deprived areas is associated with radical views. 
Methodological: One of the most innovative aspects of this project was that it examined the role of social context in these psychological processes by using a multi-level approach. Multi-level conceptualizations of social-psychological phenomena are still rare in the literature. The structure of our data allowed us to conduct sophisticated statistical analyses such as multi-level latent class analysis (MLLCA), which enabled us to distinguish different constellations of political attitudes at both the individual and the context level. This method has thus far been applied in only one published paper (a clinical study).
Key findings:
Distinguishing latent classes: MLLCA allowed us to establish a typology of political attitudes both at the level of individuals and context. The analyses revealed that three meaningful latent classes could be distinguished: individuals who support neither normative nor non-normative action (66.1%), individuals who support normative action (e.g., protest) but reject violence (24.2%), and individuals who support both (9.7%). At the level of neighbourhood, two types of context emerged: areas where the majority (83%) of respondents were apolitical and areas where most respondents supported political action (on average 59% supported normative action but rejected violence in these areas, and 16.8% supported both).
The role of emotion: A consistent finding was that contempt in relation to foreign policy, rather than anger, predicts support for non-normative action such as violence and distinguishes latent classes of people who reject vs. support violence. 
The role of efficacy: Our findings for the role of efficacy are more complex. While there is some evidence that low efficacy predicts support for violence, different types need to be distinguished. Most predictive of the rejection of violence was high perceived efficacy of normative channels.
Contextual variables as predictors: Overall, our multi-level analyses suggest that context explains a significant amount of variation in individual attitudes. The MLLCA revealed, however, that living in areas with a high Muslim concentration or in deprived areas does NOT predict politicization or support for violence.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The first paper based on the findings from this project (Tausch et al., 2011) is already widely cited and used by other research groups working on collective action and social movements. It emphasized the distinction between different types of action and identified the different underlying psychological mechanisms. These findings are important for further theory development and have implications for our understanding of radical action like terrorism.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C91E5F6B-908D-4C76-8E5E-B0B811536219</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5464859dc22397.06907330</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>631E7EB9-F1CB-4166-90D3-AF9C2A0E7643</gtr:id><gtr:title>Explaining radical group behavior: Developing emotion and efficacy routes to normative and nonnormative collective action.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of personality and social psychology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/786d24c011f46013a9829b46e87fc4fa"><gtr:id>786d24c011f46013a9829b46e87fc4fa</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Tausch N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0022-3514</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>pm_53cbfe2bfe2b6f05c</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>48EC70DA-6A03-432A-B016-8D71CEACCB0D</gtr:id><gtr:title>New Developments in Collective Action Research: Understanding Radical Forms of Action, Dynamic Processes, and Psychological Barriers</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9e4958e4234c6e78174dd7be036824c2"><gtr:id>9e4958e4234c6e78174dd7be036824c2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Becker, J.C.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>546486afa08fb3.57541120</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>05954DED-A1A5-4F8B-A644-4B519C5F7B53</gtr:id><gtr:title>Nothing to lose : desperate circumstances require desperate measures</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/1beca2e011647ce093627d43bf3eb667"><gtr:id>1beca2e011647ce093627d43bf3eb667</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Russell Spears (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>r_9685956239cb3f0b20</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A56AA146-F6F9-403F-941D-2428E232A7DF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Committed dis(s)idents: participation in radical collective action fosters disidentification with the broader in-group but enhances political identification.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Personality &amp; social psychology bulletin</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ff97313cbf22604927fd849d05a49981"><gtr:id>ff97313cbf22604927fd849d05a49981</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Becker JC</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0146-1672</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>54637d7fc99712.78377351</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/G027315/1</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-000-22-3251</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
