For example, the surface of a beachball and the surface of an inner tube are 2-dimensional manifolds: if we take a pair of scissors and cut out a small piece of either surface, we can spread it out flat so it looks like a small piece of the Euclidean plane. Although the beachball and the inner tube are locally they same, they are globally different: we can't topologically deform (by stretching and twisting, but not cutting or gluing) one of them into the other. 
 
 This project is concerned with 3-manifolds. 3-manifolds are harder to visualize than 2-manifolds, but one good way to think about them is in terms of knots in ordinary 3-dimensional space. A mathematical knot is a closed loop in 3-dimensional space which does not intersect itself. (For example, tie a knot in your shoelaces and then tape the ends of the laces together.) 
 
 Dehn surgery is an important operation in the study of knots in which we remove a small solid doughnut around the knot to form a 3-manifold with boundary. We then glue the solid doughnut back in a different way to form a new 3-manifold. The gluing can be described by a rational number called the surgery coefficient.
 
 The notion of an exceptional surgery has its origin in the work of Thurston, who showed that with the exception of certain easily described families, knots in 3-dimensional space have a very special and powerful property: their complements admit a mathematical structure called a complete hyperbolic metric. He also showed that all but finitely many Dehn surgeries on a hyperbolic knot are hyperbolic, thus raising the question: given a knot in 3-space, which of its fillings are non-hyperbolic? These &amp;quot;exceptional&amp;quot; fillings may be divided into three types, which are called reducible, toroidal, and Seifert-fibred. We are interested in fillings of the last type.

 The topology of Seifert-fibred 3-manifolds is well understood; they are essentially classified by lists of rational numbers. The number of elements in the list is the number of &amp;quot;exceptional fibres.&amp;quot; The goal of the project is to understand which Seifert-fibred 3-manifolds are obtained by surgery on a knot in 3-dimensional space. To do this, we will use a powerful invariant of 3-manifolds called Heegaard Floer homology, which has been extensively studied over the last decade. 

 Both the PI and the RA have previous experience using Heegaard Floer homology to study exceptional surgeries. The PI used a version of the invariant known as knot Floer homology to study knots which have Seifert-fibred surgeries with one or two exceptional fibres. These Seifert-fibred spaces are called &amp;quot;lens spaces.&amp;quot; It turns out that this problem is largely controlled by a certain family of &amp;quot;simple knots&amp;quot; in lens spaces. 

 The RA used a different version of Heegard Floer homology to give obstructions to a given Seifert-fibred space being obtained by surgery on a knot. His obstruction generalizes one which was used to completely answer the question of which lens spaces are obtained by surgery on knots. 

 Our proposal aims to extend the results described above from lens spaces to the case of Seifert-fibred spaces with 3 exceptional fibres. This may seem like a relatively small improvement, but in fact spaces with 4 or more exceptional fibres are much better understood; spaces with 3 exceptional fibres are the most interesting case. 

 One interesting potential application of the proposed project is to the study of knotted DNA. Many DNA knots are observed to belong to a family of knots (&amp;quot;Montesinos knots of length three&amp;quot;) which are closely related to Seifert-fibred spaces with 3 exceptional fibres. An understanding of which Seifert fibred spaces are obtained by surgery would give insight into properties of these Montesinos knots which may be of biological interest.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The direct beneficiaries of this research will be mathematicians working in low-dimensional topology, including those who are interested in Heegaard Floer homology, exceptional surgeries on three-manifolds, and knot theory. Potential secondary beneficiaries include mathematicians and biologists interested in DNA knotting and the UK community of mathematicians working on Floer homology for 3-manifolds. 

 Mathematicians interested in exceptional Dehn surgeries will benefit from an improved global perspective on Seifert-fibred surgeries. The PI's previous work on simple and low-genus knots in lens spaces provided a new framework for understanding knots in S^3 and S^1 xS^2 with lens space surgeries, upon which much of the recent work in this field is based. The project will extend this framework to knots with Seifert-fibred space surgeries, and will clarify and explain known results in this field, as well as providing new ones. 

 Mathematicians interested in Heegaard Floer homology will benefit from improved techniques for computing the Floer homology of Seifert-fibred spaces and visualizing how it varies over the set of all Seifert-fibred spaces. The project will also provide insight into the existence/non-existence of new L-space homology spheres, which is a longstanding open question in the field. 

 Via the Montesinos trick, results on the non-existence of exceptional surgeries in Seifert-fibred spaces can be translated into theorems about sliceness and unknotting number of Montesinos knots. This will directly benefit mathematicians working in knot theory, and may also be of interest to biologists studying knotted DNA. 

 The proposed project will help maintain the UK's national excellence in the area of Floer homology for 3-manifolds. In the last five years the UK has attracted a number of people working in this and closely related fields to permanent faculty positions. In addition to the PI, these include Andras Juhasz (Oxford), Yanki Lekili (KCL), Brendan Owens and Liam Watson (Glasgow), and Andrew Lobb (Durham). This represents the largest concentration of people working in this field in any country outside the US (where it is represented by faculty members at places like Princeton, Harvard, and MIT), and it seems natural that we should aim to support homegrown researchers such as the RA in this area. 

 The beneficiaries will be made aware of the results by the usual methods of seminar and conference talks, preprints posted on the ArXiv, and papers published in journals. 

 Both the PI and RA will be undertaking the impact activities, which include writing research papers and giving seminar and conference talks. The PI will mentor the RA in these areas by providing advice and comments on drafts of papers, and talks given in seminars at Cambridge. The PI has extensive connections in the Heegaard Floer community, both in this country and in the United States, and where possible will arrange invitations for the RA to give seminars and to attend relevant conferences. This will enable to RA to improve his skills in writing mathematics and speaking.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>166050</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The initial research planned for the first phase of the grant 
led to an unexpected discovery about a special class of 3-manifolds (those with multiple L-space fillings). This has led to some substantial advances on a conjecture of Boyer-Gordon-Watson relating L-spaces to the fundamental group. Together with Liam Watson and Jonathan Hanselman, we proved this conjecture for a special class of 3-manifolds (graph manifolds.) In subsequent work with Hanselman and Watson, we simplified many of the ideas in the original proof by giving a geometrical description of the Heegaard Floer homology of a manifold with torus boundary. This new description seems likely to have many applications to our understanding of Floer homology for 3-manifolds.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Together with Hanselman and Watson we are working to understand further applications of our technique to understanding bordered Floer homology for manifolds with torus boundary.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>7A86FDDF-0552-465F-B016-7220E5B4F91C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d8457fdffd92.97386101</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.03466</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>41FEEB82-EA38-4211-9BFD-E8E3C099665E</gtr:id><gtr:title>L-space intervals for graph manifolds and cables</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Compositio Mathematica</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e27d27da26cc629db34680dab2293c7e"><gtr:id>e27d27da26cc629db34680dab2293c7e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rasmussen S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a61327a5c3512.16882293</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>320A4B73-ED69-406C-92B0-C7C765809A70</gtr:id><gtr:title>L-space intervals for graph manifolds and cables</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Compositio Mathematica</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e27d27da26cc629db34680dab2293c7e"><gtr:id>e27d27da26cc629db34680dab2293c7e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rasmussen S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5aa93b5d2ca013.16833642</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AC635D96-91D8-4CB1-83C3-247BDAA35591</gtr:id><gtr:title>Floer simple manifolds and L-space intervals</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Advances in Mathematics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/acc3dbf545fa985d94e6df967b73381a"><gtr:id>acc3dbf545fa985d94e6df967b73381a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rasmussen J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0001-8708</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5aa93b5d56afa9.86791934</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0F310AF9-425D-4167-B561-EE22A14193CA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Floer simple manifolds and L-space intervals</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Advances in Mathematics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/acc3dbf545fa985d94e6df967b73381a"><gtr:id>acc3dbf545fa985d94e6df967b73381a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rasmussen J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5aa65fcf431873.85333941</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7CBACCD2-67DD-4D97-947E-D4472D007D32</gtr:id><gtr:title>Singularities</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Oberwolfach Reports</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/330e57e7244c4d04bfe411e8f89d8e87"><gtr:id>330e57e7244c4d04bfe411e8f89d8e87</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Loeser F</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5aa93b5d809532.11179362</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/M000648/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>27F853CB-FB22-4B9D-82D7-542648D097F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Algebra &amp; Geometry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
