While accepting the value of such sources and the many studies based on them, it may be argued that they have led to a bias towards theoretical speculations that tends to downplay the practical side of these disciplines. The many references to actual materials and experiments present in alchemical treatises have been largely overlooked or sidelined, partly because they appeared muddled in confusing language or because, transposing present ideas to the past, historians have assumed that alchemy had more to do with magic or philosophy than with real science. As a result, early modern 'alchemy' and 'chemistry' have often been artificially segregated, and some scholarly work has perpetuated the popular image of the alchemical laboratory as an unruly space for magic and obscure arts. Little work has been carried out to investigate the relationships between the adepts seeking metal transmutation and the philosopher's stone, and seemingly more rigorous craftspeople exploiting the mineral wealth of systematically investigating the secrets of nature.\nRecent studies have started to use laboratory notebooks and a more rigorous textual exegesis to reconstruct the practical dimensions of early alchemy. These approaches, together with my own archaeological work, are increasingly emphasising that theoretical formulations were based on actual laboratory experiments, that chrysopoeia or goldmaking was but one within a wider repertoire of practical endavours, and that alchemy cannot be studied in isolation from traditionally disparate fields such as mining, metallurgy and medicine. \nThe main objective of this fellowship is to complete an academic monograph entitled The archaeology of alchemy and chemistry in the early modern world, which will substantiate the above ideas and present a range of case studies on the most famous early modern archaeological laboratories excavated in Europe and America. These include a small secluded laboratory in a rural context in Kapfenberg (Austria), the exceptionally well preserved laboratory from the Oberstockstall chapel (Austria), the assaying remains from Jamestown and Quebec, respectively the first British and French colonies in North America, and the Old Ashmolean laboratory in Oxford - internationally renowned as the Temple of Solomon.\nThe scientific analysis of archaeological laboratories opens a new area for archaeological enquiry and provides a useful approach to redress the anachronism, undue generalisation and theoretical biases of some historical work. By analysing the origins and quality of the laboratory instruments, as well as the residues that inform about the experiments carried out with them, it is possible to access the practical dimension of the laboratory, the technical knowledge of the practitioners and the underlying understanding of nature. Importantly, the understanding of scientific laws and of the properties of materials that we can infer from archaeological data reveals that many scientific achievements were made in alchemical laboratories, and much earlier than apparent from historical sources. Furthermore, the material remains illustrate a great array of experiments in addition to goldmaking, such as processes with zinc, mercury and glass, which will prompt historians of science and technology to diversify their research foci.\nThe book will be aimed primarily at both archaeologists and historians of science, but it will be thoroughly illustrated and written in a style accessible to any educated reader. Capitalising on the popularity of both alchemy and archaeology, the publication will be used as a springboard to increase ongoing public engagement through media interaction and further popular dissemination. The work will also feed directly into the exhibition of these archeological materials in their respective museums.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Beneficiaries of this research can be identified in many sectors outsite my specialist research community. These are outlined below, while specific strategies to maximise impact are detailed in the Pathways to Impact attachment:\n\n1. Media: the popularity of archaeology, alchemy and analytical science in mass media are illustrated by Channel 4's Time Team or BBC2's The story of science, not to mention Indiana Jones, Lara Croft, Harry Potter and CSI. I have collaborated with numerous journalists and documentary producers for print and audiovisual media in the UK, Europe, America and Australia. My input has helped preserve historical accuracy and academic rigour while suggesting visually appealing experiments, pointing to ancient mysteries solved by modern research and highlighting true instances of ancestral arcane knowledge. The book and related dissemination will be followed by further collaborations of this kind. Considering the broad audiences, these activities will impact on the nation's culture, as much as in the economic growth of the producers and media involved.\n \n2. Public/private sector and museums: The new information generated through this research will impact on the display of these laboratory remains in the relevant museums. For both Kapfenberg and Oberstockstall, the assemblages are the principal or only collection in dedicated local museums which constitute the main local cultural attraction - any change in these museums thus has a direct impact in the local community. Raising the profile of the Old Ashmolean laboratory in a university town such as Oxford will bring immediate appeal to locals and tourists alike, and it may attract larger audiences to the History of Science seminar series at the Museum for the History of Science. In Jamestown and Quebec, experimentation in search of mineral wealth was at the core of the colonial enterprise, and this research has a direct bearing on the reconstruction of such activities for public display. In all of these cases, an update of the exhibitions based on cutting-edge analytical reserach is likely to increase community awareness of the value of their local heritage and attract new visitors, with subsequent benefits for local education and economy. In the medium term, these museums may inspire others to give more prominence to the display of laboratory instruments in their collections.\n\n3. Wider public: The wider public will benefit from rigorous information about such popular topics as archaeology and alchemy; this will help overcome clich&amp;eacute;s and misconceptions surrounding these themes, thus improving the level and nature of common knowledge.\n\n4. Teachers and educators: School teachers and educators alike may be important users of my research. Both my methods and the research topic itself illustrate 'science in action', exemplifying unusual applications of scientific techniques and highlighting the fascination of exploratory research and experimentation. Alchemical experiments can be reproduced and employed to teach chemistry and attract students to both humanities and sciences.\n\n5. Policy makers: Contrary to common belief, many early modern alchemists worked on the crest of the wave of empirical knowledge and constantly challenged established knowledge; at the same time, they tirelessly tested hypotheses as bold as metal transmutation and conducted experiments for the sake of finding what lay beneath; in so doing, they made exceptional serendipitious discoveries. Research funding bodies and higher education institutions may take notice of these historical examples to further support exploratory and adventurous research projects.\n\nThe full impact will only be achieved after the timespan of the AHRC fellowship, given the usual delays between submission and actual publication of the monograph.

This refocus has been partly encouraged by my own approach and findings.

The archaeology and history of alchemy are now taught in university courses on the History and Philosophy of Science, as well as in Archaeometallurgy. These developments are in part based on the significance of my findings, as well as my own teaching activities and invited talks.

Museums internationally are giving more prominence to the display of laboratory remains, and related explanations.
