Over 600 outbreaks of strangles occur in the UK each year leading to significant disruption of equine events and cost to an industry worth over &amp;pound;7 billion per annum to the UK economy. All infected horses may suffer clinical signs of disease during the course of an outbreak, with approximately 2% requiring euthanasia. Approximately 10% of recovered horses become persistently infected. The exposure of na&amp;iuml;ve horses to Streptococcus equi that is shed from healthy carrier animals during participation in equestrian events or sales is difficult, if not impossible, to avoid. Therefore, the availability of a safe and effective vaccine that protects horses from developing strangles despite their being exposed to Streptococcus equi would have far-reaching benefits for equine welfare and equestrian activities throughout the World. However, the only available strangles vaccine in Europe, a live bacterial vaccine known as Equilis StrepE, provides protection to horses for only a short period of time (3 months). 

We have modified a recently identified superantigen, named SzeQ, which normally misdirects the immune response, so that it can instead be used to strengthen the immune response to vaccination. 

In this project we propose to fuse the modified SzeQ to proteins from Streptococcus equi, which can either be used directly, or be employed as a sticky coat on the surface of a prototype strangles vaccine. This coat will act as a type of 'Velcro', which attaches to immune cells, improving the strength and duration of the immune response.

We will first produce and purify the Velcro protein in the laboratory and measure its activity and ability to induce a long-lasting immune response in ponies. Then we will attach it to the surface of a control strain of Streptococcus equi and measure its ability to stick to immune cls. Finally, we will produce the Velcro protein on the surface of a prototype strangles vaccine and determine if it improves the strength and duration of the immune responses produced following the vaccination of ponies and the ability of these responses to kill Streptococcus equi in the laboratory.

This project has the potential to solve a significant problem in the development of safe and effective vaccines that protect against this highly prevalent and important disease of horses. Furthermore, coupling of the Velcro protein, or versions thereof, could also enhance the effectiveness of an array of other vaccines to protect pigs, cattle, sheep and man.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The only available strangles vaccine, Equilis StrepE, which is available for use in Europe suffers from a short duration of immunity (3 months), despite being a live attenuated product. Moreover, a new multi-component subunit vaccine, Strangvac, is only 30% effective 3 months post-third vaccination.

We have identified a novel superantigen, SzeQ, which is produced by ~1% of strains of Streptococcus zooepidemicus. Superantigens are potent stimulators of the immune response and function by cross-linking MHC Class II to the T cell receptor (TCR). Mutation of the TCR-binding site of SzeQ (Y39 to I) enabled us to disrupt TCR-binding, whilst maintaining MHC Class II binding properties. These properties of SzeQY39I provide an exciting opportunity to improve the presentation of novel vaccines to the immune response, which could increase the duration of immunity they confer.

Here we will fuse SzeQY39I to 20 suitable surface proteins of S. equi, generating an MHC Class II-binding 'Velcro' that targets vaccines to antigen presenting cells (APCs). The immunogenicity of the most active Velcro protein, compared to the surface protein alone, will be determined by vaccinating Welsh mountain ponies. The Velcro protein will then be transferred to a superantigen defective S. equi mutant and a new prototype live attenuated vaccine strain to determine the effects on APC-binding and the strength and duration of immune responses produced post-vaccination.

This project has the potential to solve a significant problem in the development of safe and effective vaccines that protect against this highly prevalent and important disease of horses. Furthermore, coupling of the Velcro protein, or versions thereof, could also enhance the effectiveness of an array of live attenuated vaccines for use in farm animal species and man.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research to be conducted here has beneficiaries beyond the academics listed above. Anyone with an interest in horses, whether commercial, medical or recreational is a potential beneficiary as the ability to enhance the strength and duration of immunity conferred by vaccination will improve our ability to protect against strangles. This includes the owners, breeders and trainers of horses and additional staff whose livelihoods depend, directly or indirectly, on the welfare of horses. The equine industry contributes &amp;pound;7 billion per annum to the UK economy and directly employs up to 270,000 people managing a national herd of 1 million horses. Furthermore, the equine industry plays an important role in the social and cultural aspects of life within the UK through the involvement of horses in the sporting and leisure activities of millions of people within the UK. The impact of strangles on the UK horse population is well recognised by the equine industry and research towards mitigating the threat that strangles poses has received significant funding from the charitable sector (Horse Trust, Bransby Home of Rest for Horses, PetPlan Charitable Trust), equine organisations (British Horse Society, Welsh Pony and Cob Society, European Breeders Fund) and the Horserace Betting Levy Board (HBLB).

Our research on S. equi is motivated by animal welfare and the results of research in this field are of interest to veterinary practitioners. The endemic status of strangles in the UK, coupled with the inability to protect horses using a long-lasting vaccine confounds all but the most rigorous of disease prevention strategies. The research to be conducted in this project has the potential to turn the tide in favour of protective vaccination against strangles, leading to significant benefits to the health of horse populations in the UK and abroad.

As superantigens play an important role in the pathogenesis of other infectious diseases, including those of farm animal species and man the benefits of this project could extend beyond the health and welfare of horses. If successful, the Velcro system would provide a novel strategy by which to enhance the strength and duration of immunity conferred by other vaccines, benefitting the health of many other animals, including man.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-06-05</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-03-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>268746</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/P002757/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>48D25546-6ADF-479A-8877-478CCDB1DC1F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Animal Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>2607D197-52EE-40CA-A1D5-A46D18C3F97F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Microbial sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A502D25A-BB70-4F74-844D-32A2BAD075A5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Animal Diseases</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4A2A69ED-37ED-4980-91A7-E54B4F6A9BC6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Animal organisms</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E2AC43A0-F15F-4F00-8557-FB2D01D65940</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Immunology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5BA89E2C-27FE-4553-819B-3CE27FC71EC2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Microbiology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>75BBF8D4-D2E9-4106-B484-743614789AF9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Microorganisms</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
