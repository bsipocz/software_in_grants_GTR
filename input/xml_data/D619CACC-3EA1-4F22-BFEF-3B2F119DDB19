Groups are widely studied abstract mathematical objects. In some sense, group theory is the study of symmetry. Groups have applications in most areas of mathematics, as well as in physics, chemistry and other sciences. I will investigate certain aspects of representations of finite groups. A group may be seen as a collection of abstract elements that can potentially become symmetries. A representation is a way to associate symmetries of a concrete structure to those elements. Representation theory has proved to be an extremely valuable tool for investigating groups. Indeed, representations allowed mathematicians to find relatively easy proofs of deep theorems about groups. One of these theorems was proved by Georg Frobenius as early as 1901, and despite significant efforts, nobody has found a proof that does not use representations ever since. Representations are important in their own right and have numerous applications, for instance, in the study of molecular symmetry in chemistry.Two major types of finite group are of particular importance to this project: groups of Lie type and solvable groups. In the late 1970s Pierre Deligne and George Lusztig made ground-breaking discoveries in representation theory of groups of Lie type. They described representations using ideas from algebraic geometry, a very different branch of mathematics. On the other hand, representations of solvable groups have been successfully investigated by more direct methods.The underlying theme of this project is to bring these two approaches together. I will research representations of intermediate groups, each of which consists of two components, one solvable, and the other of Lie type. The key aim is to extend the geometric ideas of Deligne and Lusztig to a wider class of groups, thus making advances in representation theory of intermediate groups.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-10-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>212786</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The research was in pure mathematics.

A group is a mathematical structure that allows rigorous study of symmetry. In a sense, a group is a collection of &amp;quot;potential&amp;quot; symmetries. A representation is a way to associate symmetries of a concrete structure (specifically, of a vector space) to the elements of the group. Representation theory is important both in its own right and as a key tool in the study of finite groups. It has applications extending as far as chemistry.

The results of the present project may be classified into two topics:


1. New versions of global-local conjectures

Since the 1970s, several very intriguing conjectures concerning representation theory of an arbitrary finite group have emerged. Coming under the general heading of &amp;quot;global-local conjectures&amp;quot;, they relate representations of a finite group to those of its &amp;quot;local&amp;quot; subgroups. They include the McKay conjecture, the Alperin weight conjecture and the Brou&amp;eacute; abelian defect group conjecture. Having been an active topic of research for 40 years, these conjectures remain unresolved. During the project, new versions (or &amp;quot;refinements&amp;quot;) of the conjectures of McKay and Brou&amp;eacute; have been formulated by the PI (principal investigator). These refinements are (in a sense) much stronger than those considered previously and offer new insight into the relationship between representations of finite groups and those of local subgroups. The PI has studied implications of the new conjectures in some detail and has proved that the refinements do hold in several important special cases. The results have been recorded in the papers &amp;quot;The McKay conjecture and Brauer's induction theorem&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Character correspondences for symmetric groups and wreath products&amp;quot;. The latter paper dealt with the case of symmetric groups and has led (in part) to a collaboration with Rowena Paget (University of Kent) and Mark Wildon (Royal Holloway, University of London) on a different topic, that of &amp;quot;plethysm&amp;quot; in symmetric groups. The collaboration has resulted in the joint paper &amp;quot;Character deflations and a generalization of the Murnaghan-Nakayama rule&amp;quot;.


2. A proof of the KOR conjecture

Even though the symmetric group is one of the most basic types of group, there are many unanswered questions concerning its representations, particularly, those over a field of positive characteristic l, a prime number. In 2003, K&amp;uuml;lshammer, Olsson, and Robinson showed that many aspects of l-modular representation theory of symmetric groups generalise to the case when l is not necessarily prime and formulated what became known as the KOR conjecture. In this set-up, the conjecture gave a combinatorial description of the invariant factors of the Cartan matrix, an important set of invariants in modular representation theory. As a result of the project, the conjecture has finally been proved. The proof is contained in the paper &amp;quot;Generalised Cartan invariants of symmetric groups&amp;quot; by the PI. Due to previous research of David Hill, Stephen Donkin and others, the main result of that paper has a wider significance: not only does it solve a problem in representation theory of symmetric groups, but it also answers certain interesting questions concerning representations of Iwahori-Hecke algebras and Kac-Moody algebras.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>1. Global-local conjectures

The refinements formulated during the project offer a new point of view for the global-local conjectures. As those conjectures have been open for decades, it is impossible to predict when they will be fully resolved. The new refinements may be a useful step towards the eventual resolution. Moreover, if proved, the refinements would put us on a level of understanding of groups and their representations that goes considerably beyond even that provided by the original conjectures. 

When considered in special cases, the refinements give rise to further interesting problems (such as those related to endo-permutation modules for p-groups). This may spur further useful research. Methods developed during the study of the new conjectures in the case of symmetric groups are likely to have wider applicability: for example, they have already been instrumental in the proof of the KOR conjecture. 


2. The KOR conjecture

As is mentioned in the summary of key findings, the proof of the KOR conjecture improves our understanding not only of representations of symmetric groups, but also of Kac-Moody algebras and the related quantum groups. Having emerged in the 1980s, quantum groups have turned out to be fundamental mathematical structures, with applications in statistical mechanics, quantum field theory, knot theory and elsewhere (despite their name, quantum groups are algebras, not groups). In the setting of quantum groups, it is natural to consider a generalised version of the KOR conjecture, which may be interpreted in terms of &amp;quot;graded&amp;quot; representation theory. Such a generalisation has been recently (in 2012) formulated by Shunsuke Tsuchioka. Perhaps, the most immediate application of the proof of the KOR conjecture is likely to be to research aiming to resolve Tsuchioka's conjecture. Substantial results in this direction have already been obtained jointly by the PI and Dr Tsuchioka and are expected to be published soon.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>DCC122D7-A9FF-4294-BF80-37FDEBCA8A93</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-5683790329.549267779b224e</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://web.mat.bham.ac.uk/A.Evseev/publications.html</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>289AA867-8C0E-4383-B372-CE7F0D7FFC25</gtr:id><gtr:title>Character deflations and a generalization of the Murnaghan-Nakayama rule</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Group Theory</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6cbeae46649013f32830d8f4dfdd9baf"><gtr:id>6cbeae46649013f32830d8f4dfdd9baf</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Evseev A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>542bf947af5ab4.04722279</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>311DDFAB-41BF-4C6C-B51F-97F33A023AF1</gtr:id><gtr:title>The McKay conjecture and Brauer's induction theorem</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6cbeae46649013f32830d8f4dfdd9baf"><gtr:id>6cbeae46649013f32830d8f4dfdd9baf</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Evseev A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d06c06c80931a2</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BD1865CD-D81B-4935-AC20-9CF4BD1D69F4</gtr:id><gtr:title>Generalised Cartan invariants of symmetric groups</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Transactions of the American Mathematical Society</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6cbeae46649013f32830d8f4dfdd9baf"><gtr:id>6cbeae46649013f32830d8f4dfdd9baf</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Evseev A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>10886850</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>54412fdda04ae1.41139452</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/G050244/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:parents><gtr:parent><gtr:id>D619CACC-3EA1-4F22-BFEF-3B2F119DDB19</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>EP/G050244/1</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>212786.06</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2010-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2011-10-01</gtr:end><gtr:children><gtr:child rel="Transfer"><gtr:id>4ED8DEFC-C950-459D-B9AB-7EAAFD492DD3</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>EP/G050244/2</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>95842.28</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2011-10-02</gtr:start><gtr:end>2013-02-01</gtr:end><gtr:children/></gtr:child></gtr:children></gtr:parent></gtr:parents></gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>27F853CB-FB22-4B9D-82D7-542648D097F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Algebra &amp; Geometry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
