Suppression of plant defenses is common in plant pathogens and involves secretion of proteins that functions as effectors by modulating host cell processes. Recent evidence suggests that aphids, like plant pathogens, deliver effectors inside their host cells to promote infestation. However, the identity of these effectors and their functions remain unknown. In this project we applied a novel approach based on a combination of bioinformatics and functional assays to identify candidate effectors from the aphid species Myzus persicae. Results generated in this project show that candidate effectors of M. persicae affect plant defense responses and/or aphid reproductive performance. Further characterization of these candidates promises to reveal new insights in the plant cellular processes targeted by aphids.

This project is an important step towards understanding how phloem-feeding insects, like aphids, manipulate plants to enhance infestation. With this project, we set-up the first large-scale functional genomics screen for identification of aphid effectors and thereby generated lists of candidates, some of which induce a specific phenotype in plants. This project thereby lays an essential basis for further research on how aphids modulate their hosts at the molecular basis and most importantly, for identification of plant defense targets of aphids. The outlook of this work is that the identification and characterization of aphid effectors and their plant targets will facilitate the development of aphid resistant plant varieties, which in turn, will decrease the use of insecticides and improvement of the environment globally.

This project impacted society at several levels: (A) Interactions among science disciplines; (B) Collaboration with industry; (C) Training of young scientists; and (D) Communication of science to international science communities.


(A) Interactions among science disciplines

This research is interdisciplinary, as it unified the study of organisms spanning two Kingdoms (namely Animalia and Plantae) and therefore incorporated entomology and plant biology.


(B) Collaboration with industry

The results were shared with Biotechnology companies. Furthermore, the data was used towards an Industry Partnership Award (BB/L002108/1). Finally, this project has generated promising leads for strategies to increase plant resistance to sap-feeding insects. One of the leads is currently a fully funded project by industry.


(C) Training of young scientists

A Postdoctoral researcher was trained on this project. They won a Royal Society of Edinburgh/Scottish Government Marie Curie Personal Research Fellowship (2010-2015) predominantly based on the work they had accomplished in this project. The post doc started their own group as an Independent Research Fellow at The Scottish Research Institute, Dundee, Scotland.



(D) Communication of science to international science communities

The work related to this project has been presented at national and international scientific meetings, including the IVX MPMI congress in Quebec 2009, the Scottish Plant Biology Meeting 2010 held in Dundee, Aphid Special Interest Group Meetings in the UK in 2009 and 2010, and the 4th Annual Arthropod Genomics Meeting 2010, Kansas City, UK.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2009</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>C364236D-345C-4D6D-8751-1091346D6A80</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54620e2c723f22.12799887</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Introduction

Aphids, like whiteflies, leafhoppers and planthoppers, are hemipteran sap-feeding insects of plants. These insects induce extensive feeding damage, can build up to high population densities, and are the vector of important plant diseases worldwide, including Europe. Aphids have highly developed salivary glands consisting of several lobes that are predicted to produce proteins required for establishing successful interactions with host plants. A recent study showed that some aphid salivary gland proteins suppress plant defences thereby allowing the aphids to freely feed from the plants. Despite the importance of sap-feeding insects in agriculture, few researchers worldwide have focused on gaining a better understanding of the functions of the salivary gland proteins in insect feeding. The aim of this project was to identify and characterize aphid salivary gland proteins to elucidate how these proteins enhance aphid feeding. Herein, we specifically focused on the generalist aphid species Myzus persicae. 

Main results

Identification of Myzus persicae candidate effectors using a functional genomics screen
We set-up a functional genomics pipeline to identify candidate effectors (secreted salivary proteins that promote aphid infestation on plants by modulating host cell responses) from the aphid M. persicae. Using bioinformatics on publicly available ESTs from aphid salivary glands we identified 46 predicted secreted proteins (candidate effectors). With three of these candidates being polymorphic and two candidates not expressed, we cloned 48 candidate effectors from cDNA into a 35S-expression vector transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana and stable transformation of Arabidopsis. We initiated functional characterization of the set of 48 candidates.

Candidate effector Mp10 induces chlorosis specifically in Nicotiana benthamiana
We over-expressed the 48 cloned candidates in N. benthamiana using agroinfiltration assays to determine whether the proteins induce any visible phenotype in plants. One protein, Mp10, induced chlorosis in these assays. Further functional assays with Mp10 showed that this phenotype was specific to N. benthamiana as no chlorosis was observed in N. tabacum or tomato. Using Virus-Induced-Gene-Silencing, we showed that the induction of chlorosis by Mp10 was dependent on the plant protein SGT1 and HSP90, which are involved in plant defense responses mediated by resistance proteins. 

Candidate effector Mp10 suppresses the flg22 but not the chitin induced oxidative burst
Suppression of PTI induced by PAMPs like flg22 and chitin is a common feature of plant pathogen effectors. To determine whether aphid candidate effectors can suppress PTI, we assessed whether any of our 48 candidates suppressed the oxidative burst response induced by the bacterial PAMP flg22. Out of all candidates, Mp10 was found to suppress the flg22-induced oxidative burst. Follow-up assays with the fungal PAMP chitin showed that Mp10 does not suppress the oxidative burst induced by this PAMP. Thus, Mp10 specifically suppresses the oxidative burst induced by the PAMP flg22.

Candidate effectors Mp10, Mp42, and MpC002 affect aphid fecundity on N. benthamiana
In order to assay the 44 candidate effectors from M. persicae, we developed a method that allows the medium-throughput screening for effects on aphid performance. Using this novel assay, we identified three candidate effectors that affect aphid fecundity. More specifically, Mp10 and Mp42 reduced aphid fecundity when overexpressed in plants and MpC002 increases aphid fecundity. These results support the hypothesis that Mp10 may induce yet unknown plant defence responses.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The results were shared with agrochemical and seed breeding companies leading to a BBSRC Industry Partnership Award (BB/L002108/1), a full funded project by industry, a BBSRC-LINK award (BB/N009169/1) and an iCASE studentship.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E7E87F8C-C4BE-4385-B356-8E80B7980764</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54620ed83827f2.29158490</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Education,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BB267CA2-C4BD-4972-8137-06AE82863AA3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Effectors in Plant-Microbe Interactions - Martin/Effectors in Plant-Microbe Interactions</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c7e7adb2b8529e5236068cd8f7865e1b"><gtr:id>c7e7adb2b8529e5236068cd8f7865e1b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bos J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780470958223</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>54466637512724.44684875</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9DFD9E0D-6CDD-41FE-93ED-AF8EBC846D32</gtr:id><gtr:title>An Immuno-Suppressive Aphid Saliva Protein Is Delivered into the Cytosol of Plant Mesophyll Cells During Feeding.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Molecular plant-microbe interactions : MPMI</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7f3d3b16f47a71edfa12a0f3143d129e"><gtr:id>7f3d3b16f47a71edfa12a0f3143d129e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mugford ST</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0894-0282</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58b868c6507f45.56617101</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>52C743E3-BEE8-4960-BC34-477778903469</gtr:id><gtr:title>A functional genomics approach identifies candidate effectors from the aphid species Myzus persicae (green peach aphid).</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>PLoS genetics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2357ab17dc6b811369d058a2fd6aebe1"><gtr:id>2357ab17dc6b811369d058a2fd6aebe1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bos JI</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1553-7390</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>544666c4e7fa59.78677431</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BBS/E/J/000CA362</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
