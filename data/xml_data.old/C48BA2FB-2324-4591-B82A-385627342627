However there are sharply different views regarding what is meant by the notion of public good, and how unevenly distributed higher education connects with this notion. The project aims through the collection of some new data, and re-analysis of existing data sets, to consider what views different constituencies i -students, staff, governance bodies, employers, government, and civil society - have regarding a definition of public good and its connection with higher education. 

The study involves researchers working in and on 4 African countries -South Africa, Ghana, Kenya and Nigeria. These have some similarities in their higher education systems but also some differences regarding the size and shape of the public and private sector in higher education in the four countries. However, all have in common unevenly distributed levels of economic growth, and high levels of poverty and different kinds of inequalities. We will analyse the data we collect, and that from past projects and will also look at the existing publicly available information on how higher education links with wages, attitudes, and views of the public good. 

From our review of these 3 bodies of data, we will aim to develop an indicator of higher education and the public good that can be used across countries. We will involve stakeholders as our development of this indicator emerges, and at the end of the project hope to be able to offer this to the academic, policy and practitioner community as a useful way to understand the connection between higher education and the public good. We hope that this indicator will help users in interpreting data on levels of student enrolment and progression, graduate destinations, earnings and assist in reviewing arguments about public funding for higher education, when basic education and other sectors of post secondary provision are also in need of support.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research is intended to benefit key stakeholders involved with higher education and the public good -students, university staff, governance bodies, employers, government, and civil society. 

Our plans for building impact entail involving key stakeholders from these communities in early design of interviews to be conducted and reflection on how to analyse existing data. This will sensitise these representatives to some of the complexities of how higher education and public good are linked, and how contextual conditions in the four countries affect these views. 

Key informants from these constituencies will be interviewed in new data to be collected, and we will share transcripts with participants, and emerging analysis with a community of stake holder. We will also draw on older data collected since 2008 across the four countries. 

Selected representatives from these constituencies will have an opportunity to comment on the indicator of higher education and the public good we plan to develop for cross country comparison. They will thus gain insight into some of the processes involved in the development of indicators and the debates they elicit. If we are able to develop a useful indicator of higher education and the public good across countries, all these constituencies will have a publicly accessible and easily understandable tool that can be used to interpret some of the controversial and often confusing data often used as proxies for public good, such as student enrolment, graduate earning, participation in the labour force, professional expertise, and economic growth. 

The indicator we aim to develop can be used in discussions of accountability, investment in higher education, and evaluations of the inequalities higher education may entrench as a form of 'public bad'. The indicators may be helpful in guiding public deliberation of the trade offs entailed. All these constituencies will be invited to the dissemination meetings for the project in each country, so that they can offer further views on how useful the indicator will be to them.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>426535</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>CD74EFCD-3DFE-4010-B6D9-A5277538E225</gtr:id><gtr:title>Towards measuring the economic value of higher education: lessons from South Africa</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Comparative Education</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a24c1093f356a25686d25ed4a480cc5e"><gtr:id>a24c1093f356a25686d25ed4a480cc5e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Allais S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>13600486 03050068</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5aa2b2f037b566.45432097</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/P002498/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F9D6F76D-4C6C-4E36-8E06-D471DED87098</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D2DE952A-D3A4-42AA-B3D0-37E979EBA723</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology of Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>C11BDEA9-7D9D-4728-B6A9-31032921B328</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Newton</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
