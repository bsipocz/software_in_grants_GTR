It has -more than ever before- brought to the forefront issues of transnational economic redistribution and has increased political contestation in and about the European Union (EU). Contrary to the pre-crisis era when Euroscepticism was mostly an expression of public protest limited to parties in the margins of their political systems, it has now developed into a widespread phenomenon with far-reaching implications for democracy in the EU and its members. However, we know surprisingly little about the nature of politicisation of European integration and the ways in which the structure of political conflict has changed as a result of the crisis. 

Seeking to build on the literature examining democratic contestation and the politicisation of European integration, and to contribute towards an improved understanding of the nature of Euroscepticism in times of crisis, this project offers an original contribution to the study of Euroscepticism by integrating three research objectives, which aim at (1) mapping and identifying the different dimensions of Euroscepticism and understanding whether these have changed as a result of the crisis; (2) exploring the underlying causes of Euroscepticism and explaining variation in levels of Euroscepticism at the country, party and individual levels; and (3) assessing the ways in which Euroscepticism feeds back into national politics by testing its consequences on domestic political behaviour. 

In answering these questions, this project relies on a novel interdisciplinary longitudinal and comparative research design and applies an original multi-method approach through the complementary use of quantitative and experimental methods. The project will examine the dimensions and causes of Euroscepticism through an analysis of cross-sectional and time series data in all EU member states. The longitudinal design enables us to compare Euroscepticism in the periods prior to and during the crisis. The project will study the consequences of Euroscepticism on domestic political behaviour by focusing on three countries, namely Britain, Germany and Greece, which are non-Eurozone members, creditor and debtor countries, respectively. Building on my work on Euroscepticism, this study makes a significant theoretical, empirical and methodological contribution to our understanding of the politics of opposition in Europe and the literature on the EU's democratic deficit. 

The project's findings will provide evidence-based knowledge about elite and citizen attitudes towards European integration, allowing for effective policy responses to the rise of Eurosceptic sentiment across Europe. The three-year length of the project (2016-2018) will enable me to become a research leader at the forefront of political analysis, linking the project's findings to the debate over the possible 2017 referendum on British EU membership, the possibility of Greek exit and the upcoming 2019 European Parliament (EP) elections. Through its insights on the changing nature of Euroscepticism, the project has the potential to stir debate regarding institutional reform, accountability and representation in the EU. An advisory board consisting of academics and policy-makers will be consulted through the duration of the project. In order to ensure the co-production of knowledge with relevant policy communities, I have established official partnership with two think tanks, the Brussels-based Foundation for European Progressive Studies and the London-based Policy Network. Research outputs will include dissemination to practitioners and the wider public through three policy-related workshops, executive summaries, policy publications, media articles and a dedicated project website; and academic dissemination through conference participation, journal articles and a monograph.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project draws on the expertise of an advisory board, which will provide independent and strategic advice to the project from research design to dissemination. Confirmed members of the board include: (1) Professor Chris Lord, ARENA Centre for European Studies, University of Oslo; (2) Professor Marco Steenbergen, Chair of Political Methodology, University of Zurich; (3) David Kitching, Policy Advisor at the Brussels think-tank Foundation for European Progressive Studies (FEPS), (4) Renaud Thillaye, deputy director of the London-based think-tank Policy Network and lead researcher on EU affairs; and (5) Labour MEP Anneliese Dodds. The board will bring professional expertise and specialised forms of knowledge to the research process and will ensure commitment to the project's impact agenda from the outset. The academics will provide guidance on the theoretical and empirical aspects of the project. The user members of the board will enable access to key users in the UK, the Brussels community and the European Parliament, and ensure that the project's findings are presented in an accessible and relevant way to the policy community.

Key users include, but are limited to: 
(1) The European Parliament;
(2) Individual MEPs;
(3) The European Parliament's Committee for Constitutional Affairs;
(4) The EU Commission Directorate General on Communication;
(5) The Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office/Minster of State for Europe;
(6) The UK Foreign Affairs Committee;
(7) Political parties, think-tanks and non-governmental organisations working on how to tackle the challenges that Europe faces today and EU reform;
(8) National and European media; 
(9) The general public.

This research is clearly relevant to these users because of their interest in creating policy that will engage with the socio-economic and political concerns of Europeans, improve representation, limit the political space for left and right-wing extremism, and ultimately address aspects of the EU's democratic deficit. Think tanks and policy makers working on the promotion of democratic politics will have a special interest in learning more about how and why Eurosceptic sentiment has changed as a result of the crisis and the ways in which Euroscepticism feeds back into domestic politics. 

As detailed in the pathways to impact attachment, several mechanisms are put in place to disseminate the project's findings, i.e.: 
(1) The official partnership with Brussels-based Foundation for European Progressive Studies (FEPS) and London-based Policy Network will allow me to build relationships and networks with potential beneficiaries and users of my research; and provide a platform for user-specific publications, including policy briefs and research papers. 
(2) The organisation of three impact-related workshops will enable the dissemination of the findings at each stage of the project. These will include a workshop hosted by the University of York in 2016; a second hosted by Policy Network in London in 2017; and a third hosted by FEPS in Brussels in 2018. 
(3) The production of one executive summary and one policy publication per year tied to each workshop written in accessible language in order to improve engagement with the policy community and the general pubic. These will be distributed to MEPs, the European Parliament's Research Service and through the networks of the project's partners (FEPS and Policy Network). 
The research findings will be further disseminated to the wider public through:
(4) an accessible project website, which will contain information on the project, and will be regularly updated to include project-related events, news, commentary and executive summaries; 
(5) articles in media outlets, which have expressed interest in my work, including the LSE's European Politics and Policy Blog, The Conversation, The Huffington Post and Open Democracy; and 
(6) through academic outlets, such as conferences, journal articles and a monograph.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>220585</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>EU Q&amp;A Find out what the experts say!
