It is, now, widely acknowledged that this transition to a low carbon economy is unlikely to occur unless radical changes take place on the policy and technology fronts as well as within the organisational structures and how companies see their relationship with the environment. Yet, the presence of various market failures dominate the scene and as a result, many radical low carbon innovations (including photovoltaic systems, offshore wind and carbon capture and storage projects) will not efficiently materialise unless there is a better coordination within the private sector driven by an efficient environmental and innovation policy; as well as significant public support. Academic evidence on the risks and returns of environmental innovations, their drivers and barriers as well as the general understanding on green innovation system dynamics is rather new and patchy; at times failing to produce clear directions for policy makers. Moreover, environmental private sector innovators raise concerns about the lack of clarity in policy signals and the economic challenges of commercialising their innovations.

In order for the UK to meet its commitments to reduce GHG emissions, a clear road map for the transition to a low carbon economy is urgently required. While general directions are outlined in the Low Carbon Strategy (BIS, 2011); a thorough and detailed understanding of the specific needs and challenges in UK's environmental innovation system is much required to address effectively the pollution reduction targets. Through this seminar series, we aim to facilitate communication between three important stakeholders; private sector, policy makers from UK and EU, and academics from the economics, management, social marketing as well as engineering and physics disciplines. The main goal is to enable discussions about potential problems and solutions to GHG reduction, by facilitating a platform for exchange of information which can, then, be fed into a detailed road map for UK's low carbon economy in the form of concrete suggestions.

The proposed seminar series consists of six seminars. The first two seminars concentrate on the technological and organisational environmental innovations in order to explore the characteristics of UK's environmental innovations while the following two seminars focus on the central role of government policies and the public's consumption attitudes toward environmental matters. In the final two seminars, we respectively investigate the role and characteristics of the environmental sector's SME section in driving the UK's clean technology innovations and the financing needs of the environmental sector. The seminars and their time frame are as follows: 
1. Technological innovations for transitioning to a low carbon economy (December 2013)
2. Organisational innovations for transitioning to a low carbon economy (March 2014)
3. The green revolution and entrepreneurial state (July 2014)
4. Driving consumer demand for green products and services (September 2014)
5. Supporting SMEs in transitioning to a low carbon economy (December 2014)
6. Financing environmental innovations (July 2015)

It is aimed that the network created through the organisation of this seminar series will be the basis for a strong network and community that will generate future research projects stemming from these outlined topics. Such a network is crucial for pushing the boundaries of research in this field and it can channel academic research to support policy decisions and company actions.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The UK is at a crossroads facing crucial decisions in its industry, environment and innovation policies to secure a future with economic growth that is environmentally sustainable. Ground breaking environmental innovations that replace polluting technologies will be necessary alongside significant shifts to consumption patterns and how companies view their relationship with the environment. However, pressures for immediate economic recovery and growth are currently blurring the urgency of actions the UK needs to take for a low carbon future. In this seminar series, our impact targets will be achieved through facilitating the dialogue between the following beneficiaries and building a longer lasting community.

BENEFICIARIES: The beneficiaries targeted by this seminar series include (1) academics from economics and management as well as engineering and natural sciences backgrounds (2) practitioners at companies and investment firms and (3) policy makers with a focus on environment and innovation policies. A closer dialogue between these main stakeholders is crucial to all attempts to work out the details of the road map to a low carbon economy outlined by the UK government in its Low Carbon Strategy (BIS, 2011). 

MAIN IMPACT TARGETS.
-Knowledge Dissemination and Exchange: By highlighting some of the most central issues related to environmental innovations, the seminar series will facilitate further debate on topical policy issues by taking into account the academic works and practices in companies, and unveil areas for future research. Presence of the three beneficiary groups will be essential for maintaining a balanced perspective on these debates.

-Networking and Community Building: We have designed the seminar series as a platform to initiate lasting professional contacts. Through targeted invitation of keynote speakers and conference attendees as well as planned networking opportunities during and after the seminars, we hope to facilitate useful contacts between the beneficiary groups. We will use the seminar website and a Linkedin group to extend these opportunities beyond the time of the seminar series and eventually turn this group into a network for environmental innovations consisting of individuals with academic, company and policy backgrounds. This network will form the core for future collaborations of similar nature such as annual conferences.

Amongst non-academic stakeholders, we have identified: 

1.POLICY MAKERS and NGOs: UK's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), OFGEM, Department of Energy and Climate Change, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS), Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) Climate and Energy Team ,Carbon Trust, National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts (NESTA), Advanced Institute of Management Research (AIM) as well as, Eco-innovation Observatory and Green Alliance. 

2.ENVIRONMENTAL COMPANIES: UK based Top 100 Global Clean Technology companies (based on Guardian's list) as well as other firms of the environmental/energy sector that the conference organization committee have been working with over the years.

3.REPRESENTATIVES FROM HIGH POLLUTION INDUSTRIES: Companies that operate in high pollution industries face higher pressures to reduce their environmental impact while also having a relatively large potential to make a contribution to the green transformation. We will reach out to members of these industries through our local university contacts and the relevant industry chambers.

DISSEMINATING THE OUTCOMES
Each seminar will be followed up by a 2-page summary report on main outcomes of the day. These will be circulated to stakeholders with a link to seminar podcast recordings. Two widely read trade journals Clean-tech Investor and Resource Magazine have confirmed they will cover all seminars. We also aim to create a journal special issue or edited book of selected academic papers presented in the six seminars.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-03-04</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-02-05</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>20977</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Joint event organisation</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>772B2280-B568-4839-9B72-1716416F2BD3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>University of Sussex and Bloomberg New Energy finance organised the final seminar of the series jointly in order to bring the emphasis on data issues related to low-carbon energy innovations and the interaction between government and the private sector.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dea9f82290f5.53283227</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://missionorientedfinance.com/renewable_energy_finance/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>As this grant has supported the formation of a platform that brings together representatives from (1) academia, (2) private sector and (3) policy making, its is starting to actualise through raising awareness of the issues and scientific findings around low-carbon innovations as well as creating links between the individuals from these three sectors of the low-carbon economy. Academic members of our community have used the workshops to communicate their findings to policy makers and to establish personal links that can be used to communicate future research findings and inform policy making. Additionally, various contacts made between academics and private sector representatives proved helpful to identify the needs of companies in terms of consultancy and advice and have since been followed up to establish long-term relationships supported by our University engagement offices. Additionally, small business participants at the workshops informed us that they were particularly pleased to be introduced to local policy makers in their regions as these links are often difficult to make and can prove valuable in terms of benefiting from local opportunities (e.g. collaborations, funding opportunities) and for better navigating the legal framework surrounding the low-carbon innovations.
Almost one year after the completion of the grant, various non-academic impact routes can be identified. Firstly, Prof. Mariana Mazzucato has taken up the role of launching the new Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose at UCL. Low carbon innovations and the financial structures around them, a theme heavily discussed and emphasised through this ESRC seminar series, constitutes an important focus of the Institute. We expect that Prof Mazzucato's work at Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose will be a central route for the insights emerging from this seminar series to be developed into further discussions and projects with the relevant societal stakeholders. Secondly, Dr Pelin Demirel has developed a research theme funded by EPSRC Impact Grants and University of Southampton Grants, looking into the sustainable potential of small businesses operating in the UK's Sharing Economy. Collaborating with UKShareCo, an umbrella body for UK Sharing Businesses, Dr Demirel is investigating business models for scaling the operations of these small sharing companies with significant potential for lowering resource use and waste through underutilisation. The role of small businesses as green agents of the economy was another strong theme running through the ESRC Seminar Series. Additionally, Dr Demirel has been conducting a case study of the Tram Extension project in Nottingham UK, in collaboration with the local businesses and policy makers in order to better understand the tradeoffs that exist between environmental and economic sustainability objectives in the context of the UK infrastructure. This project is another route through which the main themes such as finance, business involvement, regulation and policy around environmental sustainability is currently being put into practice, generating awareness as well as knowledge that will be helpful in shaping the local infrastructure developments with an environmental focus. Thirdly, Dr Gregory-Smith's collaborative work with Global Action Plan, an independent charity with environmental and social focus, is delivering impact through evidence based research provided to shape the Charity's actions. Global Action Plan joined the ESRC Seminar Series and contributed greatly to the debate around customer behaviour related to environmental matters. Dr Gregory-Smith's close collaboration with Global Action Plan since the ESRC seminar series, furthers the impact of our discussions and translates them to societal benefits through the Real Work Sustainability Research Team: (https://www.globalactionplan.org.uk/the-real-world-sustainability-research-team).
Finally, one of the greater impacts this project delivers is through the involvement of MSc students in the Seminar Series whenever it was possible. For instance, our seminar at University of Warwick was integrated with the MSc Global Energy MBA programme to ensure that these postgraduate students took part in the discussions. Majority of this group of students are in managerial roles in energy related markets and/or national and international energy companies. A similar practice was applied at the seminar conducted at the University of Southampton, where MSc and MBA students joined the discussions. Graduate students have proved to be a sound channel for delivering impact through the Seminar Series as we have been in contact for a good number of them to further discuss relevant issues around low-carbon innovations.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>2A2F8389-D14A-491C-80BD-ED61E5BB21B9</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56dea707474cd5.69159052</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Energy,Environment,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This grant which covers the final three seminars in the &amp;quot;Innovating for a Low Carbon Economy&amp;quot; Seminar series focused on three essential elements of the Low Carbon Innovation Ecosystem: (1) Green Start-ups, (2) Finance for Low Carbon Innovations and (3) the Role of Government as a driver of renewable energy innovations. 
The first seminar in the series, organized by University of Southampton investigated the role of small and young enterprises as drivers of Low Carbon innovations, with a particular emphasis on understanding the types of innovations entrepreneurial green start-ups bring into the market. This seminar received additional funding from British Academy of Management (BAM) and Society for Advancement of Management Studies (SAMS) and was extended to a 2-day workshop with particular emphasis on supporting early career researchers who are particularly active in researching the innovative activities of green start-ups. Various papers showed evidence of the positive performance benefits of low-carbon innovations for small and young businesses, with evidence provided for firms from the UK, other EU countries, US and China. The funding challenges of green start-ups were raised as a considerable barrier for the low-carbon innovations from smaller businesses to penetrate into the mainstream technology regime. The role of crowd funding as a source of finance for green entrepreneurs was also debated in the workshop as a route for potential diffusion of low-carbon innovations. A special session on data sources related to green entrepreneurs was found to be particularly useful for further empirical research in this field.

The second seminar in the series, organized by the Open University, focused on the role of finance for Low-Carbon innovations and the mediators such as local/regional clean-technology business organisations in facilitating the access to finance for clean technology businesses. The evidence presented in this workshop highlighted the invaluable added-value of local clean-technology industry organisations in the UK as match-making platforms between firms, financiers and potential customers. These organisations are able to bring their highly efficient networks across the UK to their local surrounding and offer a valuable launch pad for innovative UK firms with low-carbon innovations.
The final seminar in the series, organized by University of Sussex in collaboration with Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF), focused on the role of government as an investor and facilitator of low-carbon energy innovations. Various presentations in this seminar highlighted that government institutions around the world have played a crucial role in the emergence of alternative energy innovations by directly investing into these innovations during the earlier phases of development. It was pointed out that this move of governments has been crucial in the development of some of the most important green energy markets and has acted as a strong pull factor for the private sector investments. Researchers and policy makers present at this seminar pointed to the urgent and growing need for investment into low-carbon energy innovations in order to meet the UK's low-carbon commitments. It was highlighted that the data related to green energy investments remains relatively limited and poses significant challenges for our scientific understanding of green energy innovations. There was a fruitful discussion with BNEF researchers to identify how this data may be collected to accommodate the needs of the research community.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The seminar series targeted three main audiences: (1) academic community (2) policy makers (3) private sector. Academic community benefited from an update on the latest academic developments related to low carbon innovations along with an opportunity to discuss the implications of their findings with policy makers and members of the private sector. Besides generating new routes for the advancement of academic knowledge, these discussions and interactions are expected to provide input to increase the policy and practitioner focus in future academic research of the community. The Special Issue on &amp;quot;Green Start-ups&amp;quot; to be published by Small Business Economics, an international, peer-reviewed journal will feature some of the most recent academic work arising from the discussions in this workshop series, and will make a significant contribution to the low-carbon innovations literature. A second special issue for Regional Studies journal on green entrepreneurship has been invited by the Editor of this journal and will serve to extend our reach to academics from human geography and urban studies fields. Additionally, the academic community that has emerged out of this project, is gearing to apply for at least two large research grant bids to be submitted to RCUK and EU.

The policy makers who were chosen carefully to represent different policy agencies in the UK and EU were presented with the latest academic findings on low-carbon innovations using the data collected by these agencies and/or independent researchers. Various contacts were established to discuss future joint research projects between academic researchers and representatives of policy making institutions such as DEFRA and OECD. Additionally, connecting policy makers with private sector representatives is expected to influence the content of industrial policies related to low-carbon innovations. 
Finally, the knowledge exchange between private sector representatives, policy makers and academics allowed owners and managers of firms to consider various business models for low-carbon innovations. Additionally, the contacts between academics and private sector representatives are being transformed into joint collaborations in the form of joint projects and teaching activities which should enhance further knowledge creation and dissemination.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>20B4B49D-920A-42C2-9BE8-9D12FE587E9C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dc5e4bb06648.18181762</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Energy,Environment,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BF1381AD-94DE-475F-89E8-0916FA59F49F</gtr:id><gtr:title>The impact of regulatory complexity upon self-regulation: Evidence from the adoption and certification of environmental management systems.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of environmental management</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8898b2df8f9880760d340c6994b1d7c5"><gtr:id>8898b2df8f9880760d340c6994b1d7c5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Demirel P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0301-4797</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5aa64363a3e861.58725573</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C26584C1-507E-4668-82D4-D04D3BD8B83F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Born to be green: new insights into the economics and management of green entrepreneurship</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Small Business Economics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8898b2df8f9880760d340c6994b1d7c5"><gtr:id>8898b2df8f9880760d340c6994b1d7c5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Demirel P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5aa643b359c521.67495738</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/L000628/2</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:parents><gtr:parent><gtr:id>A2BAF4BA-ABE8-4EDC-8C94-D256869B1541</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>ES/L000628/1</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>28448.43</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2013-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2015-01-09</gtr:end><gtr:children><gtr:child rel="Transfer"><gtr:id>71043A02-2210-49CF-B5FF-E475BD8C50F2</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>ES/L000628/2</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>20977.51</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2015-02-05</gtr:start><gtr:end>2016-03-04</gtr:end><gtr:children/></gtr:child></gtr:children></gtr:parent></gtr:parents></gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A5240626-9660-4BCA-A8F1-528736D7026E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environmental economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D6F08770-CB96-423D-89E7-3F64DE17997E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Innovation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
