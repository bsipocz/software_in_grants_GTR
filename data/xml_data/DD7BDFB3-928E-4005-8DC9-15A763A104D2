Phases 1 and 2 (2012-13) will focus on teaching and developing online resources for 3 pioneer Universities committed to developing the teaching of quantitative skills across undergraduate degrees in social work (Bath, Bedfordshire and Queen's Belfast).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The aim is to provide specialist teaching and increase the use of quantitative data across all elements of the course. This will be supported through an interactive web-based facility will be developed to combine a variety of resources for academics and students, including teaching aids, key texts and interactive lesson plans and activities.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Phase 3 (2013-14) will involve the roll-out of teaching through three 1-day courses, two advanced courses and a mentoring system based on learning sets to up to 12 other universities. In Phase 4 the web resources will be finalised and made available to the whole of the social work academic community.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project will be evaluated by comparing the knowledge and views of students and staff prior to any changes, after the first year and then at the end of the RDI. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Social work is the lead discipline in the field of social care. UK expenditure on social care is in excess of &amp;pound;20 billion per year, with around 1.5 million people employed in the sector and more than 3 million receiving social care services. Social workers provide a particularly significant element of the workforce in this area as they tend to have managerial and budgetary control. Furthermore, a significant amount of social care research is led by or involves social work researchers. The current proposal therefore has the potential to have a significant positive impact beyond its capacity to provide for better educated social work researchers. 
The proposals would lead to an increase in the number of social work practitioners who were quantitatively literate. This will contribute to social work practitioners having a more nuanced and thoughtful approach to research. It is particularly important for understanding research relating to what does or does not work in social work. It is also to be hoped that as these practitioners progress in their careers and move into senior professional and management positions their improved understanding of quantitative research designs and methodologies will allow them to be more discerning users of and commissioners of research. 
In the medium to long term the proposal is intended to provide for more and better quality quantitative research within social work. This is particularly likely to increase the field of evaluative research. Research has suggested that by far the most common questions that social workers want answered related to what works, but that less than 4% of research studies address such questions. A project on this scale would not on its own address such a significant structural issue, but it would contribute to developing more researchers able to address such questions. In the long term it is hoped that such a body of research would benefit social workers (in that they would have a more robust evidence base for heir interventions) and the people who use social work services.
The paths to such longer term impacts are complex. The proposed project would lead to more quantitatively literate social work graduates from the pioneer universities and other universities where staff take part in the advanced training and support. This alone is not an insignificant impact, with more than 200 graduates per year from the 3 pioneer sites and up to 1000 if the maximum of 20 other universities undertake significant changes. More generally it is hoped that given the current appetite within the social work academic community for action to address the lack of quantitative research capacity there will be a high use of the online resources and materials produced within the project. 
The RDI proposal would be particularly likely to achieve significant impact if the accompanying CI proposal were funded. The CI proposal provides an opportunity to develop in depth a common shared curriculum for teaching quantitative research. The RDI project provides the perfect opportunity for sharing learning and resources developed during this process.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-01-07</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-01-08</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>75880</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>This project, and its companion project (ES/J011835/1 -known as Making Social Work Count) were part of the Researcher Development Initiative rather than a research project. Making Social Work Count involved the development and pioneering of a core curriculum of 10 session for undergraduate students at 3 universities (Bath, Bedfordshire and Queen's Belfast). This project provided funding to support the roll-out of this core curriculum to a wider audience.

The project supported the provision of training, mentoring, further online materials and a conference to support the roll-out of the materials across a minimum of 11 additional universities. As such the two projects together look to have significantly influenced and increased quantitative teaching for around 500-600 students per year, as well as providing a package of materials and support that has been used to various levels across several other universities.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>75F144EC-8BED-4A3B-9712-2440747A4A67</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>559a612b3d0262.15796233</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project provided training, mentoring, group support and online materials to complement the core module of quantitative research methods teaching delivered in the companion project.

We were highly successful at obtaining involvement from a large number of universities who undertook to put the whole of the module or substantial elements of it into their teaching.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>As noted above, the materials are being widely used by 11-20 universities. They are available on http://www.beds.ac.uk/mswc (a URL that ResearchFish does not recognise).

At the final conference (Sept 4th 2014) participating academics requested a textbook to accompany the materials and training. We have a contract with Policy Press and aim to publish this in early 2016.
The evaluation report is being written up and will be submitted to the Journal Social Work Education later this year.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D27204A7-0D5F-4689-AF5A-D85593F82AAF</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>559a627c7bdbc2.87028023</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>31B7BF6E-D5C1-4330-9453-BC397F9D7C8F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Quantitative Research Methods for Social Work: Making Social Work Count</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d87b188dfd82cb7ff1df550877d41c02"><gtr:id>d87b188dfd82cb7ff1df550877d41c02</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Teater Barbra</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781137400260</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>586ce94712d936.63657335</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/J011754/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>ACFABADE-E54A-4FC7-B9F5-259A19D97CDB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Work</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FB535BD0-E265-4C0A-8532-32DCB83A3951</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tools, technologies &amp; methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FFA3A6C9-532B-4B83-B6F7-AAF3E63D34F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Stats., Comp. &amp; Methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACFABADE-E54A-4FC7-B9F5-259A19D97CDB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Work</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
