Soft Estate is the term used by the Highways Agency to describe the natural habitats that line our motorways and trunk roads, (some 30,000 hectares of land nationally). Whilst roads play a major role in opening up land for housing and economic development, their attendant verges offer a genuine refuge for wildlife and a modern form of wilderness in the midst of intense urbanisation and agro-chemical farming. Our road network, the site of some of our most carbon-intensive activity, is flanked by Britain's largest unofficial nature reserve.

The principal subject of this practice-led research is to visually investigate these under-represented areas of roadside wilderness, both as ecological and metaphorical spaces and as reflectors of the complex and changing relationships between travel, the environment and landscape imagery within British culture. In framing this research I will draw on the English Landscape and 'picturesque' tradition of the 18th Century, which informs popular understanding of landscape even today. 

While early tourists travelled to areas such as The Lakes to capture images of wild places, in today's countryside uncontrolled wilderness only springs up in the margins of our transport networks and the semi-derelict grid plans of industrialised corridors. I believe these Edgelands invite a new kind of tourist, new ways of looking and new forms of visual representation. In drawing on the landscape tradition, and capturing details of the flora and fauna of the verge, my work will engage viewers with landscapes that appear familiar and uncanny, traditional and strangely futuristic.

Equipped with a Claude Glass, the 18th C tourist would capture particular views and aesthetically tame them. Today, for instance, the rear view mirrors of automobiles have an equivalent framing effect and would inform images conjured from a contemporary perspective. Modern motorway design incorporates 'Clothoid' or transition curves, features that focus drivers' attention so that they stay alert. These have the effect of smoothing the landscape reminiscent of eighteenth century parks, where curved carriage drives managed the experience of the landscape. Motorways arguably represent the modern equivalent of the spectacular re-sculpting of the landscape undertaken by Capability Brown. This was not without its 'picturesque' opponents. Tour writer and landowner Uvedale Price rejected Brown's projects, describing them as 'levelling', Price no doubt being aware of the political ramifications of the term. 

These verges are powerful signifiers of environmental degradation, urban development and our increasing separation and alienation from the land itself and at the same time, of optimistic progress. Roads open up access to landscapes they despoil. Through drawing on the picturesque tradition in making this work, I aim to open up new ways for people to visualize and connect with these landscapes.

The resulting solo exhibition at Bluecoat Liverpool, Soft Estate, in 2013, will build on projects in which I exhibited work in Little Chef restaurants with a view to reaching a wider public and prompting reflection and debate on the travel choices we make and how these affect our environment. I am currently working towards a related parallel show across the local network of Little Chef restaurants to draw a wider audience to the Bluecoat and prompt reflection on travel and landscape. I have already established a good working relationship with writer and environmental campaigner, Marion Shoard, vice-chair of the British Association of Nature Conservationists (BANC). Her expertise in the area of land access and discarded land will provide a valuable sounding board to my researches and her contribution to the Bluecoat publication will provide a 'value added' spin off to the project.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit?

A wide range of academics, ecologists, landscapers, environmental designers and land use policy makers. As an independent organisation, BANC has a significant role in widening debates about how we understand and use the land around us. By highlighting issues around both biodiversity, and the visual functions of these spaces, this research will have implications for transport policy makers both here and abroad.

Land managers. This project will draw attention to a nationally based hybrid landscape that covers a wealth of habitats and enclosures and would be relevant to those managing land across the public and private sectors, for example local councils, local government, the highways sector and even companies involved in reclaiming and reinstating landfill sites. 

Wider public, road users in general, but in particular families and children who will see the work exhibited in Little Chef (LC) restaurants. I envisage satellite works exhibited in these locations bringing a new and unexpected cultural experience to their customers and staff, connecting the public in new ways with the aesthetic value of contemporary landscapes they regularly pass through at speed but rarely consider. The pilot for this satellite show, 'The Garden of England' Little Chef Tour in 2009, generated considerable media interest with BBC South East TV news running a feature on the project. This element could potentially bring new audiences into the Bluecoat through the platform of LC.

By exhibiting the work produced through this Fellowship at an internationally important gallery with a supporting publication, I will be encouraging the public to make connections between past and present modes of travel and the impact this has on the environment. People will have to 'travel' from LC to Bluecoat. I am working towards a curatorial strategy highlighting car travel and use of major roads.

The supporting publication 'Soft Estate' will draw on a range of disciplines to contextualise the work and in so doing stimulate discussion and debate on the associated field of ideas. Bluecoat has functioning discussion groups. Its 'resident philosophers' regularly meet to discuss themed ideas related to gallery events. Bluecoat would publish this with Liverpool University Press (LUP) who would also organise distribution. Bluecoat are currently in discussion with Cornerhouse regarding additional distribution.

There is a societal benefit through raising awareness of valuable but often overlooked habitats maintained as part of the landscape of the national road network. The Bluecoat, and projected LC exhibitions will raise public awareness of the present and future value of this landscape and encourage engagement with the related rich cultural heritage by working with Art and Literary communities, practitioners and writers.

What will be done to ensure they benefit?

Working with partner, Bluecoat, to ensure findings are disseminated to a wide audience through the exhibition and accompanying inter-disciplinary publication aimed at specialist and general audiences. Publication and distribution through LUP.

Publication/Book launch in Liverpool.

Gallery and Museum press and PR. Educational talks, events and also activities aimed specifically at schools, families and children.

Working towards presenting a paper for a BANC conference and a written piece for their magazine ECOS. I aim to further my discussions with Marion Shoard

Working towards gallery and LC marketing ensuring maximum publicity. Website/web links presence

I envisage working with LC to ensure work is seen by a wide public. (large estimated average footfall per restaurant per annum) 

I am in discussion about further exhibition outcomes with Harris Museum and Gallery, Preston and Turner Contemporary, Margate, with a studio visit by their curator planned for Autumn 2011.

The exhibition was informed by the Horniman Museum and Gardens' taxonomy collection and their plants, both living and preserved but also by their recent re-discovery of four Anna Akins folios of cyanotypes in their library collection and the following helps describe some of the exhibition's rationale:-

Edward Chell's fascination with collecting and classification led him to the Horniman's rare folios of cyanotypes by Anna Atkins, the 19th C botanist and pioneering photographer. In Bloom, an installation of forty new painted panels, Chell responded to Atkins' work by portraying both live plants from the Horniman Gardens and pressed specimens from the museum's herbarium.

Chell's exhibit spotlights diverse narratives surrounding natural history and ecology, bringing into question the values and emotions that emerge when we make images of plants.

Atkins was a scientist and while the 'sun prints' she produced are exquisite, her objective was to document and understand natural genera. Through this process Atkins created repeat motifs and patterns that resonate with the decorative arts of her time, such as Willow Pattern china, floral wallpapers and Wedgwood's blue and white Jasperware.

Chell explores the tension between the scientific drive to define, understand and control, and the aesthetic impulse to capture the unruly gorgeousness of natural life.

Silhouettes bring associations of memorialisation and loss. While Atkins' recorded newly discovered species, today such images are premised on conservation and the threat of extinction.

An accompanying display which Chell, drawing on the museum's collections, conceived as a Cabinet of Curiosities, echoes these themes. Carboniferous fossils, 18th C ceramic plates imported from China and one of Atkins' rare folio volumes are displayed alongside Chell's ornamental pairs of car silencers, etched with roadside plants.

An accompanying colour illustrated publication Bloom further unpacks these themes and ideas, with essays by Anna Ricciardi, Edward Chell and Hugh Warwick, published by Horniman Museum and Gardens in November 2015.</gtr:description><gtr:id>9EE4675A-2AE2-481B-956E-ABA58205761C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Apart from the large visitor numbers and related Museum events connected to the solo exhibition opening on July 9th and open to a large and varied public seven days a week from 10 July - 6 December, the exhibition and book attracted some good and positive coverage.

The exhibition came about through a collaboration with Stour Valley Arts, Kent and was timed to open during the summer solstice alongside Stour Valley Arts' mid-summer Festival in Kings' Wood, 2013. The exhibition ran from Saturday June 22nd, 2013 and ran until Sunday September 8th, 2013. The exhibition comprised of sixty hand made gesso panels depicting a virtual taxonomy of some of the most common plant species found both Kings' Wood, Challock, Kent (SVA's rural work site) and the national motorway network. The works were configured in such a way as to suggest the uncontrolled nature of the way plants disperse and seed themselves, reflected in the case of the museum by placing works in between and in relation to their collections of C18th and C19th paintings, artefacts and collections of ethnographic, biological and historical material. The exhibition was accompanied by an accompanying publication and Artists' Book, 'Eclipse' that was funded by Arts Council England.</gtr:description><gtr:id>56FB1FBE-C1E2-469D-ADC6-FC7346FF54D8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The impacts from Eclipse can roughly broken into three. 1. The exhibition. 2. The book and 3. The Gallery Talks.

1. The visitor numbers for Eclipse were huge and impact quite broad. Here are the figures provided by the Beaney - Exhibition on view for 79 days. Total visitor numbers to Beaney during that period were 130,451. 35,421 (18%) visited top floor galleries and 23,400 the Ground Floor Garden Room gallery. Visitors included 5 school groups, 3 FE/HE student groups, 25, Foreign Language Student Groups, 1 group of cubs/scouts visiting and creating work for Arts Award Explorer and one group of homeless people from 'Porchlight' working with artists in the Beaney.

2. The book 'Eclipse', published by Stour Valley Arts' (SVA) and funded by Arts Council England and was used by SVA in a number of related activities including a 'woodland' tour around the edges of Kings Wood, Challock, Kent. The book is available through Amazon and several bookshops and is distributed by Cornerhouse Books, Manchester. See: http://www.cornerhouse.org/bookstore/product/edward-chell

3. There were two gallery talks at the Beaney on Saturday 6th July, 2013, one at 11.30am - 1.00pm and one from 2.00pm - 4.00pm. These involved a brief presentation about the ideas behind Eclipse in the Beaney's education workshop followed by discussion and then a gallery tour with further questions.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>m-1350984108.9611723a7176184</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Eclipse</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://stourvalleyarts.co.uk/edward-chell-eclipse/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Soft Estate is a solo exhibition project which opened at Bluecoat on 5th December, 2013. The exhibition ran until 23rd february, 2014. The sixty panels constituting the exhibition 'Eclipse' were reconfigured to form a virtual verge within a single exhibition room along with an accompanying botanical print made using road dust. The exhibition comprised of a number of distinct pieces including large paintings on canvas, object/artefacts, text-based sign pieces, road dust prints and two short films exploring plant forms experienced as both solitary phenomena as a mementoes or shrines to lives lost while travelling, both exploring silhouette and ruin as metonyms for loss and memory embedded in both contemporary and C18th thought. The exhibition installation can be seen at http://www.edwardchell.com/ or also http://www.thebluecoat.org.uk/

Bluecoat organised a series of events connected to the show including a guided edgeland walk and a themed talk by award winning 'edgeland' writers Paul Farley and Michael Symmons-Roberts on February 6th, 2014. On February 15th I presented a guided tour of the exhibition for the Contemporary Art Society (Northern Region) attended by approximately forty people.

Accompanied by the book Soft Estate, the exhibition also included a small number of artists were invited to participate introducing a range of different works in order to establish a visual conversation between different and contrasting strands of the 'edgeland' topics being investigated. The artists were Tim Bowditch and Nick Rochowski, Day Bowman, Jan Williams and Chris Teasdale (The Caravan Gallery), John Darwell, Laura Oldfield-Ford, George Shaw, Robert Soden and Simon Woolham.</gtr:description><gtr:id>70ACD6F1-FC9D-4BF4-BE31-6601A6FFDCE3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The impacts were many. These fell into the following categories. 1. Review coverage and blogs 2. Impact of the exhibition to the general public and artist presentation. 3. Workshop activity and talks. 4. Future commissions, exhibitions and plans resulting from 'Soft Estate'. 5. Visitor numbers

1. The exhibition 'Soft Estate' and associated publication attracted both national and international coverage that are detailed under 'Engagement Activities'. Most, though not all, of the coverage is also detailed on my personal website http://www.edwardchell.com

2. The impact to the general public was large. The day to day anecdotal reports from the gallery staff, curator and educational staff were that that the public found the exhibition both stimulating and rewarding. certainly this was reflected in the quality and amount of review coverage and the response during my three engagements directly with the public. These were at the opening in December 5th, 2013 where, along with Bluecoat's director and Artistic Director I made a short address about the project. The second engagement was a much larger gallery based talk and tour with curator Sara-Jayne Parsons on Saturday 7th December. There were around fort to fifty people attending this event and the nature of the questioning afterwards, though intensive, reflected the nature of the exhibition in opening up environmental questions. The third talk to the Northern Branch of the Contemporary Art Society (CAS) on Saturday 15th February, was again very well attended (about 40) and again opened up a whole area of questioning with regards to aesthetic relationships to these edgelands. As a result of this successful talk, and a further presentation with Professor Ken Worpole at CAS in March, I was invited by the Northern CAS co-ordinator and curator Mark Doyle to become an artist member of CAS. The results of this Fellowship can now be seen on CAS's website at http://www.contemporaryartsociety.org/artist-members/edward-chell/

3. The workshop and educational activities provided by Bluecoat were exemplary and having seen some of the outputs from school based workshops in the gallery, I was struck by the quality and engagement of the work produced from paintings and objects to short pieces of writing.

4. The exhibition and tour have resulted in a generation of interest and future projects/exhibitions that I could not have fully foreseen. Firstly there is a project developing out of a related set of ideas using exhibiting with and responding to a newly discovered set of folios of Anna Atkins cyanotypes from the 1830's at the Horniman Museum, London, to start in July 2015. This will run along an exhibition curated by Liverpool's Museum of the World called 'Plantastic' which is also coming to Horniman and to which my exhibition will provide a foil. Other projects include one with Meadow Arts, scheduled for 2016, called 'DeTour' and dealing with issues around the picturesque, travel and environment. There is another commission in development for a wallpaper installation with the National trust exploring the lost 'ghost garden' of the original plant collection at Croome Court in Worcestershire. The Holburn Museum in Bath have also visited my studio with regards to a future project, possibly in 2017. This amount of interest from larger public bodies reflects a diverse and strong cultural impact of Soft Estate and Eclipse and they way these exhibitions opened up new possibilities.

5. Visitor numbers during the exhibition period were in the order of 19,500 according to Bluecoat figures.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>m-8203101547.624079a7178c7c</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Soft Estate</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.thebluecoat.org.uk/events/view/events/1868</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The exhibition features work by some high profile artists who reflect an wide range of the artists who have shown over the last fifty years.

Some works from the same eight artists were included as part of the narrative conversation, though quite a few of these works were either edited or otherwise restructured. The works from the main exhibitor remained largely unchanged. Like Bluecoat, Spacex instigated a number of events, 'gallery breakfasts' and educational projects around the exhibition and ran a symposium at Exeter University on Saturday 26th April called 'Art of the Edgelands' featuring a number of interdisciplinary investigators.</gtr:description><gtr:id>DB671BD6-01E0-4017-8B34-031E920E57A8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As with the first part of the exhibition, the impacts were varied and can be described in the following ways. 1. Gallery Talks and Presentations. 2. Related educational activities 3. Small Conference/Symposium at Exeter University.

1. There two main gallery presentations. The first was for gallery staff, curator, techical staff, educational staff and the gallery's wide range range of volunteers. About thirty people attended this event. The presentation by myself lasted about 40 minutes after which there was a range of questions and answers that ranged over a whole realm of related topics. Staff and especially volunteers were eager to engage and had lots of questions. The second of the two talks took place as part of the opening event on Saturday 8th April. This was very well attended (fully booked out) and there were probably in the region of about 100 people present, practitioners, curators, other related professionals, academics and the general public. The presentation again lasted about 40 minutes but in a way that was continually peppered with questions and answers, after which a more tangible question and answer session took place. Again I noted the concrete engagement from the quality of the questions and the interest generated.

2. Spacex had an ongoing and related education program working with students both within the primary and secondary sector but also undergraduates. The impact of these activities was no doubt very high especially when these engagements also contributed to large visitor numbers. 

3. The Conference/Symposium at Exeter University was fully booked and well attended. Data from the feedback sheets provided clearly indicated the public concern about how we treat these spaces and their relative importance. I was also struck by the amount of awareness and prior knowledge brought to the conference discussion. Among the academic attendees some were involved in PhD's while others were on MA programs. The attendees also travelled from a wide geographical area from many parts of the country. Questions asked included: 1. Have any themes emerged from the day that you either anticipated or found surprising? What are these? 2. Did any aspect of the theme strike you as having more importance? 3. If so, what can we learn from this? 4. Are there any aspects of the discussion that could impact on policy either at a local or national level? 5. if so, please can you describe how this might be implemented? 6. Are the worlds of creativity. visuality and ecology divergent or do you see them as having a mutually enhancing role? and 7. How do you see edgelands and borders? 

The conference/symposium was introduced by Christine Boyle, Project co-ordinator for the AHRC theme 'Care for the Future. Thinking Forward Through The Past' and PA to Prof. Andrew Thompson, AHRC Follow-On Fellow. I made the first keynote presentation and chaired the discussion panels following on from the speaker sessions. 

As with the other entry on this section on Soft Estate, the impacts are now being seen in a developing portfolio of future outcomes stemming from 'Soft Estate'.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>m-1613846059.5289674a7173934</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Soft Estate (second leg of tour) 8th March - 3rd May, 2014</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://spacex.org.uk/exhibitions/soft-estate-8-march-3-may-2014/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Curated by Karina Joseph of Field Gallery, 'Sensing the Landscape' was supported by Arts Council England and ran in October 2015.

'edgelands have become the lowest grade of landscape in UK landscape conservation terms'. The symposium had six key speakers including artists, cultural geographers (from the University of Exeter)and other commentators. The conference/symposium was introduced by Christine Boyle, Project co-ordinator for the AHRC theme 'Care for the Future.

Ken Worpole covered the exhibition and book making comparisons to Patrick Keiller's Tate exhibition and book 'The Possibility of Life's Survival on the Planet'. Here is a short section from the blog - 'Most of us will only ever see these marginal gardens at speed and through glass - they are not immersive landscapes in any way. Of equal emotional significance are the roadside memorials or shrines now placed to commemorate accidents and fatalities. Driving recently into Cambridge along a dual carriageway, the verges were marked by elaborate shrines at frequent intervals - an erstwhile Appian Way of crosses and cairns. Chell's exhibition and books alerts us to these new forms of cultivated (and occasionally sacralised) landscapes which have emerged almost by default, but now form part of the new English countryside'.

The New English Landscape was a Leverhulme Award funded collaborative project between writer Ken Worpole and photographer Jason Orton documenting the changing landscape and coastline of Essex, particularly the coastline, estuaries and urban edgelends. The blog continues this investigation of peripheral and and contested territories and hence the interest in Soft estate. The well respected blog is read by both a wide general public, cultural commentators and environmentalists.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-1162024141.44019060cd4fffe</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academic audiences (collaborators, peers etc.)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://thenewenglishlandscape.wordpress.com/tag/edward-chell/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Bloom Book Review in Third Text by artist, curator and writer, Joan Key</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8F65F6EB-F67A-4F49-AC6E-1D8812EE4381</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The review by Joan Key was for the magazine Third Text online.

Landscapism describes that 'The central argument of the book is that there is a 'connective visual experience' between the Picturesque designed landscapes of the eighteenth century and the modern motorway infrastructure, which both acts as a network to visit the fossilised National Trust world of stately homes and deer parks and also mimics the use of reveals, curves, inclines and other architectural conceits to mediate the relationship with, and views of, the surrounding environment'. the book concentrates on the publication 'Soft Estate' and while it is difficult to summarise impact quantifiably, judging from the amount of positive coverage the book has received, the impact could be assumed to be nominally high.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-1731937873.85890050cd4fd6a</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academic audiences (collaborators, peers etc.)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://landscapism.blogspot.co.uk/2014/03/soft-estate-edgelands-as-wilderness-or.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Leonard Reviews</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8155DDF5-EB17-4FA8-8080-ABC69139ECDF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Leonardo Reviews is a scholarly review service published since 1968 by Leonardo, The International Society for the Arts, Sciences and Technology.

The first talk on the day before the exhibition was open to the public was for the curating staff, all the voluteers and others connected to the running of the gallery. About 30 people attended this talk that was followed by a Q &amp;amp; A discussion session. The Second talk was for the gallery going public that is a mixture of professionals, gallery curators, academics and other interested parties. This took place on saturday 8th March from 1.00pm and followed a similar to the first except to say that there were many more people there - at least 100. The gallery was packed with people standing, acting simultaneously as opening, exhibition guide and introduction and a forum for debate about issues surrounding the exhibition.

The article written by Anna Ricciardi was published as part of the Artists' Newsletter round up of exhibitions and projects.

Ricciardi's incisive piece captures the unusual feminine thread connected to C18th chaperoned flower collecting and open up a whole and usually hidden narrative connected to current ecologies. She describes the fact that 'Chell's practice of 'flower painting', therefore, implicitly refers to a gendered cultural history of value, class and taste. This is the point at which Eclipse becomes more than merely a charming portal to a bygone age or a pleasing juxtaposition of 18th century aesthetics and ideas with current environmental concerns. when viewed against the joyful optimism of 1960's flower power or the aspirations of a self-sufficient suburban 'Good Life' in the 1970's, for example. the elegiac, mournful quality of Chell's plant portraits feels rooted in the present day. The review can be found on the URL below.

Anna Ricciardi's piece did reach a wide national audience via Artists' Newsletter and as such would have had an impact, though that is difficult to describe specifically.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-6575869560.7780190cbcbf16</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.a-n.co.uk/p/4030873</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>'Soft Estate' - An Interview with Edward Chell in 'The Clearing'</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>399FE702-7404-422B-A67F-A445E7FFEB3C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The very timely and in-depth interview on the excellently regarded and critically evaluative blog 'The Clearing' was by one of the collaborative editors, Jos Smith.

The blog states that ''Soft Estate' is a term used by the Highways Agency to describe those natural habitats that have evolved alongside motorways in this country. It is also the title of a fascinating new book with essays and artworks by Edward Chell, Sara-Jayne Parsons and Richard Mabey that explores some surprising links between the landscape gardeners and theorists of the picturesque in the eighteenth century and our present day motorway architecture. Finally, it is also an exhibition that has been touring the UK and is currently at Spacex in Exeter until early May this year. Jos Smith went along to talk to the artists behind Soft Estate, Edward Chell, at Spacex, to ask him about what drove him to reflect so thoughtfully on an aspect of our landscape that so many take for granted every day&amp;quot;.

The interview with Jos Smith covers some of the history behind the genesis of thinking behind 'Soft Estate' and goes on to develop a number of cultural and historical touchstones exciting and animating the work and ideas. It is difficult to eveluate the impact, but this is well researched and respected academic blog based with academics at Exeter University so is both a very useful research tool and has a wide range of followers.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-6921390552.93182850cd4f98c</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academic audiences (collaborators, peers etc.)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://theclearingonline.org/2014/03/soft-estate-an-interview-with-edward-chell/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Edward Chell: Liverpool</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8C38C884-85A9-481F-BDC7-BAB0503C5E9D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Review in the exhibitions section of the Guardian Guide of Saturday 14th December, 2013.

During the research and initial production phase of the Fellowship the opportunity arose for an exhibition at the Beaney Museum in Canterbury to open at the end of the fellowship period in June 2013. This opportunity provided a point in time for a milestone exhibition to try out and evaluate a set of the works being prepared for the exhibition 'Soft Estate' at Bluecoat Liverpool in December 2013. This set, I decided, was to be titled 'Eclipse' and the resulting exhibition of these new works was curated by Stour Valley Arts (SVA) and the Beaney. While preparing written research for Soft Estate I decided that Eclipse would provide a good opportunity for producing an associated publication. On the back of AHRC funding and the new exhibition opportunity I secured another &amp;pound;10K from Arts Council England in February 2013 that enabled the production of this publication, also called 'Eclipse'. Working on the book became a sounding board while still producing the art works for Eclipse so integrating both the writing, production of artwork, and contextualising the two in a way that informed subsequent public discussions and presentations. The model reinforced my sense of Soft Estate (Book &amp;amp; Exhibition) fulfilling a similar role. The Beaney exhibition also tied to a range of arts activities organised by SVA such as their mid-summer Solstice Festival and activities connected to the publication as a kind of woodland 'identification' guide. The project also highlighted the large biodiversity of road-sites and motorway verges as these species mirrored those found in the woodland. The Beaney ran a range of related educational activities and their visitor figures for the period of the show (June 22nd - September 8th) were immense at 130,451 visitors. In terms of the findings - in this case Eclipse, the book and show - directly impacted on 3 FE/HE student groups, 25 Foreign Language Student groups, and even a group of cubs/scouts doing work for their Arts Explorer Award. Eclipse also attracted some national coverage in Artists' Newsletter with an excellent and incisive review by Anna Ricciardi, the influential bellwether taste-making website 'ItsNiceThat' and the Arts Council/Dept. of Education website Culture 24. This coverage reflects a range of cultural impact makers.

Subsequent to the exhibition, the book Eclipse has been available and bought from events such as the Bluecoat and Spacex openings (2013 &amp;amp; 2014 respectively) and other related events such as that at the Contemporary Art Society, London (CAS) for Soft Estate and the Exeter University conference where there was much interest. Eclipse, published by Stour Valley Arts, is a case bound 108 page fully illustrated wood/verge plant taxonomy. It includes an introduction by Curator Dan Howard-Birt, an essay by celebrated historian Jenny Uglow and an interview between Dan Howard-Birt and myself. The book is distributed by Cornerhouse Books, Manchester.

On December 5th 2013 'Soft Estate' opened at Bluecoat and ran until February 23rd 2014. Like the Beaney, this was well attended and the figures from Bluecoat for the exhibition period were also large at 19,500 visitors. As with the Beaney, the findings from the fellowship came out both as an accompanying book and exhibition of related artefacts. This was a much larger show both in the size, amount of works exhibited, the research parameters and the inclusion of the other invited participant artists to further the visual conversation contextualizing 'Soft Estate'. 

The Bluecoat ran a range of events connected to the show from an Edgeland talk by Paul Farley and Michael Symmons-Roberts (6th Feb, 2014) to an edgelands walk conducted by Colin Dilnot. Bluecoat's educational outreach programme associated with the exhibition reached a wide audience of school children and was amply evidenced in an exhibition in the adjacent Atrium gallery within the Bluecoat complex during the latter part of Soft Estate. This children's exhibition comprised of objects, sculpture and paintings (some with silhouettes of plants) with accompanying creative/descriptive texts. It was clear that children from Primary age upwards had seriously engaged with, been influenced by and understood material in the exhibition. The Bluecoat also run a well established and highly innovative education programme called 'Blue Room' working with people with special educational needs. The work produced, displayed in some of the adjacent public spaces, evidenced a strong engagement with the subject matter by these participants who had clearly understood and benefitted from the exhibition. The exhibition itself had a broad effect on the community and I have anecdotal evidence from fellow academics in northern universities of their students referencing the exhibition in both written work and in studio outputs. The two public presentations at Bluecoat - 7th December and for Contemporary Art Society (CAS) members on 15th February 2014 were well attended and received with 40 - 50 attendees at the first and about 30 at the second. They both provoked vigorous debate and questions and, partly as a result of the high quality of the CAS presentation and discussion, I was invited to be a CAS artist member. 

Like Eclipse, Soft Estate had an accompanying publication. The book Soft Estate was published by Bluecoat. The book is case bound, 152-pages full colour with introduction by Bryan Biggs (director) and essays by Sara-Jayne Parsons (curator) and Richard Mabey, a leading environmental commentator and activist. The book also included a fully illustrated extended essay by myself called 'Soft Estate' in which I discuss my findings. The essays tie in well with each other, Richard Mabey's essay 'Hidden Dips' also referring to the Picturesque tradition and referring to Uvedale Price as a proto-green. As with 'Eclipse', the book is distributed by Cornerhouse books, Manchester and is stocked by bookshops including The London Review of Books Bookshop, Camden Arts Centre and South London Art Gallery. The book gained good coverage (e.g. Leonardo Reviews online) and is still attracting comment with reviews scheduled for publication in the coming months with ECOS, cassone-art.com, Cultural Geographies and the International Journal of Urban and Regional Studies. It was selected as March 2014 book of the month by The Learned Pig, 'the online magazine on art, nature, thinking and writing'.

The exhibition attracted a lot of press and other coverage reflecting a strong interest in the ideas and questions being posed by the book and exhibition. These included the Guardian Guide; the Times Higher Educational Magazine; Art Monthly and many others detailed on my website.

Following on from the Bluecoat the exhibition toured to Spacex in Exeter, a major South West arts venue. Soft Estate at Spacex opened on Saturday March 8th and ran until Saturday May 3rd, 2014. Public interest was reflected in strong visitor numbers. The education team at Spacex ran 'gallery breakfasts' along with a more traditional school based program and reported a positive response to the visualisation of these sites opening up the subject for children. It was clear from my first presentation at the beginning of the exhibition that there was a strong and informed interest and a willingness to engage with and re-evaluate these sites. The questions and answers ran for about forty-five minutes and provided both a thorough interrogation of the subject and an enriching experience. 

Likewise, the one day symposium at Exeter University held on 26thApril, supported by the AHRC Follow On Fellow, Professor Andrew Thompson and introduced by Care for the Future co-ordinator Christine Boyle, provided a fertile arena for discussion and debate over the topics raised by the book and exhibition. What I found surprising was that there were strong ecological responses, surpassing aesthetic questions, to the visual manifestation of the exhibition work itself (for example the road dust prints really caught the public imagination because of the apparent contradictions in the material combined with the plant images depicted). This prompted questions and responses that are already shaping the ways my visualisation of these habitats might now develop. In response to the above I am also aware of the limitations in the way ecology is often visualised and that there is still a profound need to be able to make sense of these fugitive and changing habitats that both engage and challenge an ever widening public as environmental stakeholders. The questionnaire responses to the conference at Exeter University 'Art of the Edgelands' reflect this. I also found that the edgelands I explored provided serious interest to a wide section of delegates. The delegates, ranging from senior academics to postgraduate students and members of the general public, came from a diverse range of places from Birmingham and Nottingham in the north to Brighton, Farnham and Cardiff reflecting a wide geographical interest. 

I also organised a book launch event for Soft Estate at the London offices of CAS with a discussion about edgelands with myself, Professor Ken Worpole and Curator Sara-Jayne Parsons, chaired by Bluecoat's Director Brian Biggs. This was attended by over 60 people.

Projects now developing as a result of the Fellowship

As a result of the fellowship I have shifted some of the visual emphases towards the biological and ecological aspects within this terrain of research. My solo project 'Bloom' opening in July 2015 at the Horniman Museum in London and running for five months has developed from work produced for Eclipse and Soft Estate. 'Bloom' will respond to a recently discovered set of Anna Atkins cyanotype folios within the Horniman collection and as such will further develop imagery using plant silhouettes combined with the predilection for collecting. Commodity fetishism, encouraged and facilitated through our road transport networks will also be an underlying theme. 

Other projects developing as a result of Soft Estate include an exhibition being organised by Meadow Arts and encompassing a range of invited practitioners whose work explores themes connected to the Grand Tour and the environment. The exhibition titled 'De Tour' is scheduled to open in 2016 at Compton Verney's large contemporary art gallery referencing their collection of C18th artefacts and paintings and planned to tour major museums across Europe. The exhibition provides a valuable context for further exploring aesthetic relationships between contemporary landscape and eighteenth century models. 

I am developing a large wallpaper installation for the National Trust's Croome Court in Worcestershire. Entitled 'The Chinese Room' I have secured university research funding and both in-kind and financial development funding from the NT. 'The Chinese Room' will further explore the potential offered by silhouette plant forms as a visual cue for themes of 'extinction', C18th global trade and Chinese culture. The wallpaper installation will depict plants from across the globe to present a 'ghost' garden, reanimating what was once England's second largest horticultural collection (described in the archive 'Hortus Croomensis').

Some further coverage from Soft Estate

New material referring to Soft Estate is still emerging. The ecological bi-annual almanac 'Dark Mountain' published an extract from Eclipse of my interview with Dan Howard-Birt with accompanying images in the section on 'Soil', pages 34 - 40 under the chapter heading 'Microcosmos' (ISBN 978-0-9564960-5-8). The British Association of Nature Conservationists (BANC) are to review my book Soft Estate in this winter's edition of their quarterly magazine ECOS. A Fellow of the Rachel Carson Centre in Munich, Luke Keogh will include images from Soft Estate in a publication to accompany the exhibition at the Deutsches Museum in Munich, 'Welcome to The Anthropocean: The World in our Hands' (opening December 5th 2014).

Curators from the Government Art Collection (GAC) visited my studio to see work from Soft Estate this summer and the director and deputy director are to visit in January 2015 in relation to my work being proposed for purchase for the collection. Curators from the Holburne Museum in Bath also visited the studio this summer with a view to developing a project with them out of Soft Estate.

I have submitted my findings to the Highways Agency and The Institute of Highway Engineers and I am in conversation with the ecological charity 'Plantlife' (in relation to their Verge campaign) who are keen to make use of my work.

These organisations, their staff and contributors include national policy advisors affirming the cross-disciplinary connections I am making with these writers and professionals. With Soft Estate there were some real disappointments such as Little Chef not being able to participate while in the middle of national restructuring. They were unsure at the time about which restaurants might be affected and clearly could not commit in such a fluid moment. However, these disappointments were offset and more than mitigated by the unforeseen extra outputs such as the 'Eclipse' exhibition and book, the 'Soft Estate' tour to Spacex and the Exeter University symposium.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>06F6C7D4-B303-4DB8-B92F-FB2E8EDFB570</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>546260041f0be2.67134879</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Environment,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>In Soft Estate I explored motorway landscapes in relation to the C18th Picturesque Landscape tradition, how this informs our sense of these environments today and how this might further inform a sense of the value of these spaces especially in relation to ecologies. 

Methodologies:

Using visual methodologies exploring both the micro and macro was highly effective and prompted a very strong response across a wide range of publics and across disciplines. The combination of visuals representing these largely unnoticed and counterbalanced worlds prompted engaged debate with a strong emphasis on the ecological and cultural value of these spaces.

Using this strategy on the scale that the Fellowship allowed facilitated the production of larger scale works, objects and installations and enabled me to see the visual impact of this strategy on a scale not previously realised. This also had a significant impact and public response.

The methodology of combining both exhibitions with attendant books (Soft Estate and Eclipse) was a highly effective tool to both ground the artwork and open up the discursive elements around it in a way that did not simply describe the work. Instead, the books became integral to the outcome, facilitating the unpacking of underlying ideas and proving a powerful tool for discussion. The books also provide an afterlife for the exhibitions. This combination of exhibition with embedded publication will inform my future practice.

Research Questions:

The Fellowship has shifted the emphasis of my research onto the ecological questions underpinning my visualisations. This is already informing questions associated with a solo exhibition 'Bloom', developing out of Soft Estate, to be shown at the Horniman Museum, London from July 2015. These questions are concerned with extinction, taxonomies, collecting and material values, and their overlap with environmental preservation. Questions about visually combining the micro/macro worlds of plants with narrative devices used in Chinese wallpapers also informed prospective investigations for a potential wallpaper installation for the National Trust's Croome Court but this was not realised

Another area of my research growing out of the Fellowship is the visualisation of refuse, waste, dumps and consumption (urban infrastructures comparable to roads) and exploring these themes within contemporary landscape. This is feeding into a project I am developing with curator Richard Hylton with an initial exhibition outcome scheduled for Autumn 2018. I am working towards producing an accompanying publication for this exhibition to further unpack the associated ideas building on the model provided by Soft Estate

Networks and Partnerships:

A number of new partnerships developed from Soft Estate with The Horniman Museum, London and now with Meadow Arts in Warwickshire participating in an exhibition scheduled for the summer 2017 an called 'Artificial Landscape' that will be shewing at the country house associated with an early Capability Brown Landscape, Weston Park and also in Shrewsbury Museum. 

I have also built a network of reviewers from different disciplines and specialisms who have responded to the research. From the Soft Estate book launch and symposium at the Contemporary Art Society (CAS), I significantly extended my network of contacts across academic disciplines building links with The Rachel Carson Centre, Munich; the ecological charity Plantlife's verge campaign; London Wildlife Trust; BANC; Compton Verney, Meadow Arts and others. 

Soft Estate has brought together a wide range of academics and commentators, is still producing outcomes and enabling the solid building of future projects on its foundation.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The 'Soft Estate' research and exhibition significantly contributed to the growing public debate and appraisal of edgelands and their aesthetic, cultural and ecological value. The project has already impacted on research students attending the Exeter University Conference, others publishing online, both references and writing in their research portfolios.

The research associated with Soft Estate is used within my university teaching, particularly at PhD level and MA, and my connections with academics from other universities and different disciplines have further broadened the scope of academic possibilities for the work. An example of this extensive reach is Cambridge University Professor Matthew Gandy's review of Soft Estate in the 'International Journal of Urban and Regional Studies' in 2016. BANC's magazine ECOS also reviewed the publication 'Bloom' the book associated with the Horniman Museum and Gardens art installation that grew out of 'Soft Estate'. Other cross-disciplinary magazines such as Leonardo also covered the exhibition and publication 'Bloom'.

My research is already feeding into the development and articulation of ideas by a range of students and peers within my immediate academic community.

While a few of the projected outcomes in Pathways to Impact were not met, other unforeseen outcomes are developing and have already developed. The Bloom exhibition and installation with The Horniman Museum and Gardens detailed above has already happened and for the Meadow Arts exhibition, also detailed above, work has been newly made in preparation for 'Artificial Landscape' curated by Meadow Arts) is scheduled for the summer of 2017.

The work is being used by a number of writers and forming a contextual reference point within other publications. Fo r example, the ecological charity Plantlife expressed a wish to use Soft Estate material in their Road Verge campaign.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>17FCB992-794A-41D2-AF8C-08C1C8B58D7E</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546260a55e49c0.66925720</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Environment,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.edwardchell.com/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C8940CE6-D3D0-40C3-BBA0-3EE2A865875D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Edward Chell: Eclipse</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a72ba710cba86ae9a398eb3a6ea812af"><gtr:id>a72ba710cba86ae9a398eb3a6ea812af</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Uglow Jenny</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780955871979</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>5464b3e77ea3c5.54559057</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6370E0AA-925F-4EF2-BF43-2EA5DDAD1478</gtr:id><gtr:title>Bloom</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f2fa7ce352e1ff54ba3bd1eecb9753fe"><gtr:id>f2fa7ce352e1ff54ba3bd1eecb9753fe</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Edward Chell</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-903338-05-6</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>56df100d6daa63.78400129</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A4B366D1-5E33-4736-8700-7F332E4044D8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Soft Estate</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/26bddb376f6cdde6ba606f8cee3e3060"><gtr:id>26bddb376f6cdde6ba606f8cee3e3060</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Chell Edward</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780953899678</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>5464b3a27d79d8.75998418</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/J005797/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A8CCE2FA-9D1B-4880-9BD3-C4C078F9CD7F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Fine Art HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
