The proposed project aims to tackle the challenges to address the global demand on seafood consumption by addressing primary livestock production and food security, through the development of innovative solutions and field demonstration required to establish a commercial solution making available a novel candidate aquaculture species, the European Lobster. This species has recently been identified as the top marine species for aquaculture development by the Norwegian government and Sweden is now focusing on lobster as one of its top priorities for aquaculture development. The successful lobster grower 1 (LG1) project has provided a solution to the technical barriers currently prohibiting commercial aquaculture of the species. Lobster grower 2 (LG2) aims to tackle the technical and ecological uncertainties through further innovative solutions related to the sea based deployments, whilst introducing the innovative Sea Based Container Culture (SBCC) systems generated in LG1. The further objectives of LG2 will be to roadmap the environmental, economic and social considerations in order to unlock commercial investment and exploit a valuable human protein source at minimal unit cost, creating wealth and jobs in vulnerable coastal communities. LG2 seeks to undertake a complete field evaluation of the SBCC systems developed in LG1, whilst de-risking the commercial realisation of the farming system through further development of innovative anchoring systems and monitoring techniques for sea based deployments. LG2 will bring together a multidisciplinary consortium of experts from technical, engineering, research, market and policy backgrounds to take an innovative approach to overcome the technical and economic challenges currently preventing a novel candidate aquaculture species from being commercially exploited. 

Lobster Grower 2 (LG2) specifically addresses the lack of technical advances in lobster aquaculture by further progressing developments made in LG1. LG2 aims to i) ensure technical robustness of European lobster farming system allowing survivability and secure stock production, ii) understand potential environmental impact that allows to put effective mitigation actions in place, and iii) provide a detailed economic assessment based on farm operations and leading to the development of an aqua-economical predictive tool. The only other developmental work taking place is being undertaken by members of the European Lobster Centre of Excellence, (ELCE). Projects in Iceland, Sweden, and Norway are currently examining Land based Recirculating Aquaculture System (RAS) combined with Robotics approaches to culture. The land based RAS approach employs a technology with considerable barriers to market entry (very high start-up and capital costs) and very high operational costs (electricity, feed and staffing). It is therefore anticipated that long term, SBCC will have a competitive edge over land based RAS approaches. This project's approach is therefore radically different to the approach being developed elsewhere in Europe and represents a significantly innovative approach.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Support from the Agri-tech catalyst has been secured for a 36 month project, addressing fundamental food security challenges by examining novel angles to expand aquaculture; to include a species not currently exploited, the European Lobster. This species commands the highest value (by volume) of any species landed in the UK and exhibits a significant supply deficit. Sea based culture, in containers (SBCC) exhibits the potential for a low carbon form of rearing with no feed costs. The project will use containers specifically designed for the species, developed in an early stage project, to assess performance and develop holistic application of SBCC systems. The project will run a pilot scale lobster farm to gather practical, operational, environmental, biological, engineering, economic and social data that can be used to develop an essential tool to encourage and inform future investment. The consortium will be led by the National Lobster Hatchery and consists of two SME's, two HEI's and a Government Agency.
Key technical innovations associated with this project will address the development of suitable anchoring systems, providing safe and robust operation, and cost effective access solutions for harvesting. In order to measure the impact of installations a sophisticated environmental monitoring exercise will be implemented, utilising novel water quality string configurations. The technical and environmental sea trials will be supported through oceanographic studies in the form of point measurements, providing flow and wave characteristics. These studies will provide the scientific evidence to inform possible environmental impacts and technical uncertainties towards new aquaculture ventures.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>In the joint policy paper published on the 22nd of July 2013 by the Department for Business Innovation &amp;amp; Skills, the Department for Environment Food &amp;amp; Rural Affairs and the Department for International Development, it is identified that agricultural science and technology is rapidly becoming one of the world's fastest growing and exciting markets. It is also stated that the UK's food export in 2012 was in the order of &amp;pound;18 billion and that the entire agri-food contributes &amp;pound;96 billion or 7% of gross value to the UK, with an employment value to agriculture and fishing being in the order of &amp;pound;3.8 million. For the UK to hold its position as a strong producer and supplier of agriculture products and services it is essential to pursue the technology revolution within the sector, which has been described within the policy paper to be driven by global changes such as i) a rising population, ii) a rapid development of emerging economies with western lifestyle aspirations and iii) a growing geopolitical instability around shortages of land, water and energy.
 
Furthermore, as identified in the 'Sustainable fisheries and aquaculture for food security and nutrition' report from 2014 by the 'High Level Panel of Experts on Food Security and Nutrition' (HLPE), overall 158 million tonnes of finfish, crustaceans, molluscs, miscellaneous aquatic animals were produced in 2012, of which 91.3 million tonnes come from inland and marine capture fisheries and 66.6 million tonnes from inland and marine aquaculture. The continual growth in fish production - mostly from aquaculture since the 1990s - and improved production efficiency and distribution channels enabled the supply of fish for food per-capita to more than triple at world level since 1950, from 6 kg/cap/yr in 1950 to 19.2 kg/cap/yr in 2012. The today capture of finfish, crustaceans, molluscs, miscellaneous aquatic animals provide 3.0 billion people with almost 20 percent of their average per capita intake of animal protein, and arther 1.3 billion people with about 15 percent of their per capita intake. Through the economically and environmental sustainable production of farmed European Lobster a significant contribution can be generated to the further provision of capita intake of animal protein and hence positively contributing to food security.

The European lobster is a high value species, not currently exploited in the aquaculture sector: fisheries are limited and demand exceeds supply. In 2004 it was estimated that only 4.3% of demand was being met and the estimated market was around 70,000 and 50,000 tons of live and frozen product respectively. Supply, however, is limited to approximately 3,000 tons per year, thus there is a supply deficit of somewhere in the region of 120,000 tonnes and a clear market opportunity for the species (Kristiansen et al, 2004).
This project aims to progress the UK's aquaculture industry by enhancing the prospect for the culture of a species not currently exploited in the aquaculture industry. There is a critical mass of knowledge in the UK and the physical and chemical properties found in our coastal waters match the biological requirements of this high value candidate species. Further development of aquaculture will therefore provide an economic boost to the UK's agri-tech industry. The yearly global markets for live and frozen lobster is estimated to rise due to the increase in demand with product requirements estimated to be between 50,000 and 70,000 tonnes, whilst current landings of the European Lobster are in the order of 5,000 tonnes (http://www.fao.org/fishery/species/2648/en). By taking in consideration a price for the Lobster of &amp;pound;15 per kilogram (as identified in an article by The Telegraph from 28th April 2013) and assuming an increase through European Lobster farming from 5,000 tonnes to 20,000 tonnes the market increase would be from &amp;pound;75million to &amp;pound;300million per year.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>803536</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Centre For Environment, Fisheries And Aquaculture Science</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>MoU between CEFAS and University of Exeter</gtr:description><gtr:id>ABF6991D-1F70-4506-A271-FA393A953ED5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>InnovateUK and BBSRC funded Lobster Grower (LG2) project.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56c753979076e4.44582167-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Work on four research projects with CEFAS lead to this partnership.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The work implemented by myself and by the research team I'm leading has resulted in a request to implement a MoU</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Market Research: This work is in its early stage but a scope of interviews for purposes of market research has been decided on and interview campaign has been started. Attendance at the industrial steering group meeting on market perceptions have been used to interview four members of Industrial steering group, including Tesco and Waitrose representatives. Other outreach and approaches made to SAGB, overseas experts and seafood merchants via email have been started.

Socio-economic impacts: A review of fishery legislation that is likely to affect a Lobster farm has been started. A template / contents page has been drafted and circulated to the wider group, as well as face-to-face consultant have been implemented with local fishery society. Early findings from the LG2 project have been discussed with the participants. 

Scientific Impacts: LG2 industry lead, National Lobster Hatchery (NLH) in Cornwall, has previously shown that rearing at sea has been found to accelerate growth and improve survival compared to traditional aquaria-based on-growing in mono-layer tray systems (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277961947_Development_of_sea_based_container_culture_for_rearing_European_Lobster_Homarus_gammarus_around_South_West_England), with maricultured lobsters appearing better prepared for wild release, both physically and behaviourally. Additionally, NLH studies have shown that lobsters reared in containers at sea show an increase in the expression of behavioural traits associated with post release survival. Lobster Grower 2 gives the opportunity to assess the practicalities of rearing juvenile lobsters at sea on a semi-intensive scale, and will provide us an unprecedented opportunity to explore how and why maricultured lobsters differ to aquaria-reared equivalents. 

Wider Dissemination to date:

The LG2 team are regularly posting on social media (Facebook/Twitter) giving updates on deployment of lobsters and water quality monitoring equipment.

A short video of LG2 has been produced with funding from The Fishmongers' Company. This video will be uploaded to the website and also be shown in the visitor centre at the NLH.

? The LG consortium successfully developed and filed a patent for a novel container for rearing lobsters in a passive, low carbon system known as sea based container culture (SBCC). Sea Based Container Culture (SBCC) systems offer the potential of a low carbon, 'green' approach to culture, providing a valuable protein source at minimal unit cost, creating wealth and jobs in coastal communities.

So far, 75 lobsters from the pre-deployment hatchery controls have been examined using a light microscope, with no significant signs of disease detected. PhD student Corey Holt has been dissecting the digestive tract and its contents from ~130 of these animals to extract the DNA, a substantial technical challenge given the size of the tissues, and with David Bass has met UoE sequencing staff to consider methodological options and their cost for this analysis. These costs have been relayed to other project partners to ensure they fit within the plan for other research streams being supported by the environmental budget. Corey has also been working on a literature review of invertebrate gut microbiota, and intends this to form a unit of publishable research. 

The 4-month biological checks of monitored stock have been completed despite inclement weather causing less precise temporal sampling than was planned. Statistical analysis of this data confirms non-random survival within novel containers, confirming observations which identified a minor design/production flaw in this prototype container. 
November and January deployments have been carried out; along with a September deployment within the main window, it is planned that (lobster supply permitting) further discrete deployments will take place in March, May, July, and September to provide the basis of a study assessing the effects of seasonality on deployment success. 

BRUV and DDC camera drops were successfully carried out in November and December 2016. Outsourced services for the analysis of this data have been identified and a preferred supplier's quote approved. Cornwall IFCA have obtained permission from the MMO and Natural England to conduct grab sampling in and around the site. This work is of direct interest to Cornwall IFCA so they are collecting the samples themselves in exchange for access to the analysed data. The first sampling is planned and awaiting a suitable weather window and is expected to be conducted in Q5. Michelle Devlin (Cefas) has provided feedback on the overall benthic sampling plan, and made suggestions on data collection and how to account for variability.

The hydrodynamic modelling using Delft 3D has commenced with experimental grids created using a temporary license software. An automated reporting system for the hydrodynamic data is close to completion. This will allow monthly or quarterly reports on the wave buoy and ADCP data to be produced for the use of all project partners. Data collection and maintenance has been carried out to in-situ loggers positioned inside and outside of rearing containers at the site.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Lobster Grower 2 will identify suitable mitigation actions to reduce environmental risk and provide customer confidence in the delivery of an 'environmental-friendly farmed product'. General environmental data will include the generation of physical and chemical data relating to the demonstration sites. This will assess conditions both within and around the SBCC devices. The investigators will assess: hydrodynamic properties and patterns including water movement (tidal, wave); water chemistry (temperature, pH, salinity, DO, TOC, organic by products and a suite of organic and inorganic properties) at varying depths, as well as the production of biological waste.

Collaboration has been entertained through a meeting between LG2 partners and Shellfish project (Cefas), who have been working on oceanographic characterisation of St Austell Bay as part of another project and has been enlisted onto the project to share his openly-available findings:
? Seasonal cycling of temperature-salinity regimes has been investigated for 9 sampling stations across the bay.
? Winter and summer temperature and salinity gradients across all sites have been summarised.
? Surface water circulation, tidal flows and halo/thermo-stratification in the bay discussed, and further existing data of interest identified.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D5D2A76D-A09C-41EE-A5E0-27726C8370DF</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58b90419dcdb71.73228758</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.lobstergrower.co.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>09AC24DB-2032-4D39-B6FA-4409CF65F7E2</gtr:id><gtr:title>Underwater Sound Levels at a Wave Energy Device Testing Facility in Falmouth Bay, UK.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Advances in experimental medicine and biology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/57a535320db714dd1c5ae6e30884f245"><gtr:id>57a535320db714dd1c5ae6e30884f245</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Garrett JK</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-4939-2980-1</gtr:isbn><gtr:issn>0065-2598</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56c7213a62eed1.23065329</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5DBE329C-D03F-44CF-AEBC-60B8B7AE7AB4</gtr:id><gtr:title>Sea based container culture (SBCC) hydrodynamic design assessment for European lobsters ( Homarus gammarus )</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Aquacultural Engineering</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/3bb239cea703c3696cd6184e7014dad6"><gtr:id>3bb239cea703c3696cd6184e7014dad6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Halswell P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58b68c17c121a1.55359068</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9FFFC590-40F6-47CF-A801-8841C6A4FB91</gtr:id><gtr:title>Long-term underwater sound measurements in the shipping noise indicator bands 63Hz and 125Hz from the port of Falmouth Bay, UK.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Marine pollution bulletin</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/57a535320db714dd1c5ae6e30884f245"><gtr:id>57a535320db714dd1c5ae6e30884f245</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Garrett JK</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0025-326X</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58b68c179d4234.03110627</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>35678B86-6805-48DF-BFD8-52721D3C751A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Population genetic structure in European lobsters: implications for connectivity, diversity and hatchery stocking</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Marine Ecology Progress Series</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4e1af8fcc6e1920c92af6e670e13e5b5"><gtr:id>4e1af8fcc6e1920c92af6e670e13e5b5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ellis C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58b937438abe42.33617717</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/N013891/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5B25B6A3-B218-4F11-8A9D-661236DF455C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agri-environmental science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>48D25546-6ADF-479A-8877-478CCDB1DC1F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Animal Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>455F5D87-6317-4EF0-9D74-72B5D9BD6375</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Food science &amp; nutrition</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4237918D-61A8-47E0-91EE-65E98661A88B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Earth &amp; environmental</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>C7A88EDD-F02E-4CF4-B7E9-E33C946EBD49</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Food processing</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B76F0E6B-0363-4D1F-9F5F-353AFD4E9DB0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Livestock production</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
