The results from this project provide the very first detailed study of the effects of age on the function of the lower bowel. Using a mouse model we have demonstrated that ageing is associated with a decrease in the size, number and water content of faecal pellets, consistent with a model of chronic constipation. Age also increased the proportion of the lower bowel that was impacted with faecal mass further supporting this model. Studies of the motility of the bowel using either native or artificial faecal pellets showed that motility decreased with age. 



An examination of the potential mechanism underlying these changes showed that ageing was associated with a decrease in the amplitude and frequency of key motor programs responsible for the movement of the faecal pellets. These changes were due to an increase in serotonin (5-HT) availability due to decreases in the expression of a key protein, the serotonin transporter (SERT), responsible for the uptake of 5-HT from the extracellular space. This alteration in 5-HT signalling causes a consequential reduction in the release of key excitatory neurotransmitters known as tachykinins. Both the changes in 5-HT signalling and the motor activity were initiated at 18 months of age. Similar changes in 5-HT signalling were seen in the rectum although in this case they were not significant until 24 months. In the rectum, Increased in 5-HT potentiated the release of the relaxant, nitric oxide, reducing motility and exacerbating the state of constipation/impaction. 



Finally, we have examined the internal anal sphincter, a ring of smooth muscle that is important in maintaining continence. A functional analysis demonstrated impairment in the ability of the sphincter to relax with age, both in response to electrical stimulation and also to the application of key neurochemicals known to drive relaxation in vivo. Specifically, ageing was associated with an impairment of nitric oxide signalling. Taken together these data provide the first detailed study of the effects of age on the function of the lower bowel. The data are consistent with a model of chronic constipation/faecal impaction and provide a unique starting point to examine the mechanisms which drive these alterations and provide the future possibility of drug therapy to treat these conditions and so prevent their deterioration to faecal incontinence.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Until now it has been difficult to determine the contribution that changes in the physiology of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract play in age-related disorders of the bowel. Specifically, it has been difficult to dissect out the consequences of these changes from those associated with the increased intake of medicines observed in older people, changes to their diet or reduced motility. These data will therefore be useful to gastroenterologists, with responsibility for care of the elderly and may provide some aid to treat age-related constipation/faecal impaction. It is perceived that the main non-academic users of these data will be the pharmaceutical industry. 



While the data generated from the current study has indicated signalling systems that are sensitive to the effects of age the main causes of these changes is still to be determined. A combination of currently submitted proposals and proposed collaborations with the pharmaceutical industry will hopefully elucidate appropriate treatments for these conditions. Currently we have applications submitted to examine the effects of existing medications to determine the possibility that they may be used off label for the treatment of age-related GI disorders. The project to date has identified and number of changes in the lower bowel which contribute to age-related chronic constipation and faecal impaction both of which can predispose the sufferer to overflow incontinence. It therefore provides important new information about how the gastrointestinal (GI) tract changes with age and the consequences these changes have on function. As such these findings would be useful for academics interested in the fields of GI physiology or ageing and also to gastroenterologists interested in age-related clinical disorders of the bowel. 



However, the main aim of this project was to provide the first detailed examination of the effects of age on the lower bowel and to hopefully utilise these data in collaboration with the pharmaceutical industry to drive future drug therapies for these debilitating conditions and so improve the quality of life for older people. In terms of potential targets for drug therapy, we have described alterations in serotonin signalling, and the release of key tachykinins which reduce motility in the distal colon and rectum, while decreases in nitric oxide release in the internal anal sphincter inhibits normal defaecation. However, the observation for at least one molecule, nitric oxide, that signalling was increased in the rectum yet decreased in the internal anal sphincter provides issues over whether a simple drug treatment targeting nitric oxide would be effective. 



Recent work has demonstrated that ageing is associated with increases in the levels of inflammatory markers in the lower bowel and as part of a recent BBRSC grant application we have asked for funding to examine whether treatments that alleviate the inflammation also restore normal function. The resolution of this problem would then potentially provide a suitable treatment for alleviating age-related lower bowel dysmotility.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>21698A0E-9879-4326-B929-953800488DC7</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-6831628425.821316775e6c00</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social
