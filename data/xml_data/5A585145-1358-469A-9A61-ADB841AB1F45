The University of Bath has had a long commitment to supporting researchers to reach beyond the walls of academia. Since 2012 this has been more formally recognised by the formation of the Public Engagement Unit (PEU). Over the last five years, the PEU has worked to create a culture within the University of Bath where public engagement is valued and supported. One way we do this is by training and developing researchers.
 
The training developed and delivered by the University of Bath has been very diverse and is always well received by those who participate. However, the University of Bath is like many other universities in that there can be a mismatch between the provision of training and uptake of training meaning the PEU puts on activities that are underused, while researchers are missing out on training they want to take part in.

During the ChallengeCPD@Bath project we will examine our training offers and look at their characteristics to see if we can identify what makes for successful training, and what is happening when it doesn't work. Once we have done this, we will be able to change our own training to improve it and make it more efficient or make changes within the wider university that are affecting participation and provision. It is not only our own training that we wish to improve. Because this is a sector-wide issue, we want other universities to know what we find, and also those who train researchers for a living. To do this, we will produce guides, toolkits and frameworks that others can use. 

The provision and uptake of training being mismatched is a long-standing challenge for the university sector. We fully expect that we will not find all the answers during the short time of being funded, but we believe we can make good progress. To ensure that we make maximum progress in the time available we have formed an Advisory Group made up of people from within the university, critical friends from other universities and external colleagues who deliver training on our behalf. Having this mix of people work with us will ensure that we take their views into account as well them being able to gain useful information for their own work in researcher development. This Advisory Group will meet three times during the project.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Through the ChallengeCPD@Bath project will contribute to a step change in how training and professional development for researchers is developed, delivered and used. We know that this is currently a challenging area and are keen to understand the challenge, pilot changes and share our learning with colleagues within the university sector and beyond.

By working with our key stakeholders locally and our national colleagues in the NCCPE, and the National Forum we have the opportunity to really get under the skin of academic professional development and offer meaningful recommendations, create useful frameworks and relevant tools.

By working with the NCCPE, their Training Associates programme and the Public Engagement Academy we will be able to affect change within CPD for public engagement. However, we are conscious that not all researchers encounter CPD through these routes so will also look to how we embed public engagement into the broader professional development of researchers. If appropriate, working with Vitae and building on the Researcher Development Framework and the PE Lens.

We will look beyond the university sector and reach out to the independent organisations and consultants that provide training for researchers. Using our local providers as conduits and representatives we will provide guidance and support for these organisations.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>37961</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R019819/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
