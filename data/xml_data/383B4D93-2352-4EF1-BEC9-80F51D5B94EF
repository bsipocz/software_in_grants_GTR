It is also one of the handful of inland waterways which continued to be used extensively for commercial navigation after the development of first the main-line railway system and later modern road transport. Most interest in the history of inland waterways in England has been concentrated on the period between 1660, when the main phase of river improvement began, and about 1850, when most traffic previously carried on canals transferred to the railways. Much less has been written about commercial carrying on inland waterways after this period, or about the administration of the waterways themselves, or about either those who worked and lived on the waterways or riverside communities, both of which had a very distinctive character. Nothing of this sort has been done in the case of the Trent.

This project seeks to remedy this gap in the literature of transport history in Britain by looking in detail at how trade and traffic on the Trent (and associated canals) changed after 1850 as a result of the coming of the railways, and then changed again after 1918 as long-distance road transport developed. It will also consider how the Trent Navigation Company, the canal companies and later the British Transport Commission and its successors responded to demands to improve the Trent and the associated canals, and with what success. Finally, it will look at life on board boats on the river and the canals, and life ashore in riverside communities whose economy dependended, certainly at the start of this period, on proximity to a major commercial waterway.

The project will be undertaken in partnership with the Friends of Newark Heritage Barge, who are restoring a former working barge (the 'Leicester Trader') as a floating heritage centre for the river and have already collected a large amount of oral testimony and written and photographic evidence for the recent history of commercial navigation on the Trent. The project, through a programme of public engagement events, will also actively encourage other voluntary organisations (town and village local history societies, the Railway &amp;amp; Canal Historical Society and riverside communities generally) to be involved. The programme will be facilitated by the named researcher, Philip Riden, who has a long record of working with community groups on local history projects and has established links with the Friends of Newark Heritage Barge.

The main sources for such a study are the records of the navigation companies themselves, records created by parliamentary committees considering bills promoted by the companies and by railway companies, published Parliamentary Papers, records of central government departments responsible for regulating commercial inland navigation, records of local authorities (chiefly as sanitary authorities), records of statutory undertakers such as drainage and river catchment boards, and any records that survive of private carrying companies (and, in the case of those incorporated as limited liability companies, their returns to Companies House). In addition, for the general history of riverside communities a wide range of standard sources for 19th- and 20th-century local history can be used, and for the most recent phase of the subject oral testimony from those involved in the river will be an important source.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project builds on the 'Writing Our History, Digging Our Past' project funded under the Phase 1 Research for Community Heritage Programme. This Phase 1 project was very successful in engaging local community groups, especially local history and archaeological societies, with the University and the academic each involved. The project team are now putting forward a Follow-On Fund bid to support up to 15 community groups and two Co-production Awards for project with particular potential for collaborative research.

This proposed co-production project will involve a direct partnership with the Friends of Newark Heritage Barge and, through the planned programme of activities, aims to engage other voluntary organisations and community groups in the project. The community partners we are aiming to work with include the Railway and Canal Historical Society (the main national body in the field), town and village local history societies and riverside communities generally.

The future impact of the project also rests in our collective ambition to use the results of the collaborative research to help the Friends of Newark Heritage Barge develop a heritage centre for the river on board their boat, the 'Leicester Trader'. The boat is already open to the public on a number of days a year and receives numerous visits from schools, local history societies and other groups. This project will enable the Friends to enhance their displays interpreting the history of the river. The Newark Heritage Barge is the only project devoted to the history of the Trent and the only waterways heritage project based on a boat not in a building. It is therefore in two respects a unique venture.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>69127</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Research Workshops</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2584295A-9A4A-4155-8C76-34026B6E7C84</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A series of workshops (six, spread over the course of the year) were held in association with Newark Heritage Barge on board the barge, and had an average attendance of a dozen or so. One was specifically aimed at teachers, few of whom attended; otherwise they were for NHB members generally and those interested in the research being undertaken. Workshops were delivered by Philip Riden (co-I), Hywel Maslen (Research Associate) and Wendy Freer (life on waterways) as well as by an educational consultant, Maggie Moreland, with whom the NHB have worked on an education pack for use in schools. Research materials for consideration at the workshops included draft text from the book arising out of the project and the educational pack, which were posted on the NHB and University of Nottingham websites as free downloads.

The workshops raised interest and awareness and led to refinements of the text of the proposed book arising out of this project. It was especially useful to have input based on the practical working knowledge of those who knew and had worked on the Trent in its later stages or could provide 'real life' context for historical data. The educational workshop, whilst attended by few teachers, was part of an extended collaboration between the NHB and local schools relating to practical examples for use by schoolchildren in schools and, frequently, on pre-arranged visits to the barge itself.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5463425550fbe3.91610473</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Participants in your research and patient groups</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/history/research/projects/trade-and-traffic-on-the-river-trent.aspx</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013,2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>A River Runs Through It - The Trent and its Communities</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>90EAD35D-6E3E-459F-8526-0756A8DAC7FE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Key participants in the project from the University of Nottingham and the Newark heritage Barge CIO gave presentations to this day-school run by the Nottinghamshire Local History Association in March 2014. The themes were 'Trade and Traffic On The Trent Since 1850' by Co-I Philip Riden, 'New Sources for the Recent History of the Trent at the Waterways Archive' by the Research Associate Hywel Maslen, 'Life on Board Boats on the Trent in the 19th and 20th Centuries' by Wendy Freer, representing the Railway and Canal Historical Society, and a presentation on the Newark Heritage Barge by Les Reid, the operator of the 'Leicester Trader'. The presentations each had time for question and discussion and the audience was very appreciative of the day school.

The day school generated requests for participating speakers to address other Local History Societies and community groups - notably Philip Riden. It also increased knowledge of the Newark Heritage Barge and enabled that group to continue its membership drive and associated events.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54633e09b9e948.68419140</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://nlha.org.uk/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Nottingham Local History Seminar</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>494AB9A1-846A-4C30-AD08-A90762FA7CE8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The University of Nottingham hold a series of Saturday Morning local History seminars on the second Saturday of each month between October and March. They follow on from a series run by the Department of Adult Education before being transferred to History. The audience consists of, among others, current and past MA, PhD and certificate students, many of whom are also members of other local and county history societies. They come from all over the East Midlands. Currently there are 100 people on the mailing list and audiences are between 60 and 90 in number. Audience members are questioning and willing to engage in discussion with the speaker which gives the session more of a seminar format. The format is for two 45 minute talks, each of which are followed by 15 minutes of q/a. The first talk focuses on research and content and the second on methodological and source issues. Philip Riden, co-I on the project, delivered a seminar of this type in the 2013-14 programme and attracted a large and interested audience.

The talk generated new requests for information about the project and about the Newark Heritage Barge as well as for further presentations to local History groups and voluntary organisations.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54633f9bc88855.66656471</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/history/research/seminars/local-history-seminars.aspx</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Project Launch and Closure Events</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>90970347-D871-4D81-B2A8-F9709EC0B23D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>There was a project launch event in May 2013 and a closing workshop in May 2014. Both were held in community venues close to the research area - a local School in Newark and a community centre at a village just outside Newark, respectively. The opening event helped to introduce the research team, make connections with local community and voluntary organisations which had an interest in waterways and canal history (who had been pre-circulated with requests for information and exhibition materials) and generated discussion about the nature of the project and its intended outcomes. The closure event was an opportunity to report findings, reflect on the processes of research engendered by the project and consider outputs (notably the publication which will come out of the project). The closing event was filmed for future reference and mounted on the project website maintained by the University of Nottingham.

The opening event generated interest, enthusiasm and requests for further information and offers of assistance. The closing event whilst marking the formal end of the funded period of research was used to assure interested groups of the continuing interest of the research team and to think about future collaborations in the project area (or in aligned areas).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>546340e5be1b83.39101142</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Participants in your research and patient groups</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/history/research/projects/trade-and-traffic-on-the-river-trent.aspx</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013,2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>This project sought to remedy the gap in the literature of transport history by looking in detail at how trade and traffic on the Trent (and associated canals) changed after 1850 as a result of the coming of the railways, and then changed again after 1918 as long-distance road transport developed. It considered how the various statutory and local bodies concerned with the river responded to demands to improve the Trent and with what success. Finally, it looked at life on board boats on the river and canals and life ashore in riverside communities whose economy depended on proximity to a major commercial waterway.

This project used the records of the navigation companies, records created by parliamentary committees, published Parliamentary Papers, records of central government departments responsible for regulating commercial inland navigation, records of local authorities and statutory undertakers and any records of private carrying companies, together with a wide range of standard sources for 19th- and 20th- century local history, to explore the history of the Trent and associated canals in the post-railway age. A Research Associate was employed to locate, access, transcribe and collect large amounts of data for use by academics and our co-production community partner, the Newark Heritage Barge Charitable Incorporated Organisation.

The Organisation (formerly the 'Friends of the Newark Heritage Barge') is restoring a former working barge (the 'Leicester Trader') as a floating heritage centre for the river. They have already collected a large amount of oral testimony and written and photographic evidence for the recent history of commercial navigation on the Trent. 

The project also worked closely with the Railway and Canal Historical Society, representatives of town and village local history societies and riverside communities more generally to record memories, recollections and testimony in support of the project's objectives. 

The project's outcomes have been used in talks on various occasions to lay audiences, in seminars run in conjunction with the Newark Heritage Barge, and in a day school to conclude the project, run by Nottinghamshire Local History Association.

The project has also been a contributing partner to the Connected Communities Heritage Network 'Before the Last Traces are Gone' run by De Montfort University Leicester. The project presented at the Network Symposium and Exhibition (Dec. 2013) and has continued to be part of that project's follow-on activities. This has helped to enlarge upon the communication and reach of the project's findings.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>C9744846-DA62-4E59-A309-CFCDA9BFAC8B</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54633b003fa1d1.66039731</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Environment,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>A large amount of previously unknown archive material relating to the Trent Navigation in the period in question, stored at the Canal and River Trust Archive at Ellesmere Port.

In the event, we were able to photograph several thousand pages of documents dating from the second half of the 19th century and first half of the 20th, which will form the basis for a new study of the Trent Navigation in this period, alongside documents, mainly at the National Archives, which are already well known.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>By writing a book aimed at a general as well as an academic audience on the history of the Trent Navigation and associated waterways between about 1850 and the end of commercial carrying in the 1970s.

At present (Feb 2016), due to the teaching and research commitments of the PI and Co-I on the original project, further funding plans have not been taken forward. However, the Co-I is still actively engaged in research towards a book on the history of the Trent Navigation.
