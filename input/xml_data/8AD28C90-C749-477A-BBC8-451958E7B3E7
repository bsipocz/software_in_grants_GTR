A Trial of very low or low dose Tenecteplase during prIMary angioplasty for acute ST Elevation myocardial infarction (T-TIME)</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Intramural</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>MC_PC_12037</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Heart attack is a leading cause of heart failure and death worldwide. A heart attack is usually caused by an acute coronary thrombosis which is best treated by emergency angioplasty with stenting to open the blocked artery and restore blood flow to the injured heart muscle. Even although angioplasty is usually successful, nearly one half of patients have persistently reduced heart muscle blood flow leading to permanent heart muscle injury. This problem is due to MICROVASCULAR OBSTRUCTION (MVO), which manifests clinically with problems such as heart failure acutely and in the longer term. The main cause of MVO is microvascular thrombosis (small blood clots) affecting the small arterioles and capillaries subtended by the initially blocked culprit coronary artery, and to our knowledge, our proposal is the only trial aimed at selectively reducing heart injury by locally breaking down clot within the small blood vessels of the heart. Although contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect MVO, offering a useful independent predictor of adverse outcome, this knowledge is not exploited as there are no known validated treatments or strategies for the management of MVO. In this study, we propose to exploit the positive therapeutic effect of tenecteplase, a clot-breaking treatment for heart attacks. Full dose tenecteplase treats heart attacks very effectively; however it can in some cases cause life-threatening bleeding complications. Our strategy of using very low doses of tenecteplase to target blood clots in the small blood vessels of the heart bypasses this issue, but exploits the drug?s thrombolytic potential by using very low doses of tenecteplase to target the small blood clots which cause MVO. We will conduct a placebo-controlled trial of low (1/10th) or very low (1/100th) dose tenecteplase given directly into the coronary artery following catheter mediated restoration of coronary artery blood flow (standard care) in 210 patients (70/group). Following catheter based removal of the blood clot (standard care), the catheter will be flushed on the table and used to slowly infuse the study drug over ~10 min directly into the culprit artery. Our aim is to determine whether tenecteplase might prevent and/or attenuate MVO with proof of clinical efficacy being demonstrated through reduced MVO and improved heart blood flow. Clinical techniques will be used to evaluate the efficacy of the different dosages acutely (ECG pre and 60 min post-PCI, coronary pressure wire during PCI) and subsequently by perfusion MRI 2 days later. MRI at 6 months will be used to measure INFARCT SIZE (scar) and heart function/volumes with these parameters representing 'surrogate' measures of health outcome. Safety assessments will include follow-up for clinical events, including death and readmission to hospital (average follow-up 18 months). We have an ADAPTIVE TRIAL DESIGN and the size of the study will adjust according to the results. If our hypothesis proves correct then we will plan a large clinical trial.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is a leading cause of heart failure and death. Whilst primary PCI to open the blocked coronary artery saves lives, nearly half of STEMI patients have MICROVASCULAR OBSTRUCTION (MVO) which is an adverse prognostic factor. Fibrin-rich microthrombi and reduced blood flow contribute to distal microvascular injury/MVO, these being detectable acutely in the cath lab and subsequently by MRI. MVO is an independent predictor of adverse remodelling (a cause of heart failure) and reduced survival, so increasing the public health burden of MI. However, there are no evidence-based treatments for MVO. Although OTHER CURRENT STUDIES also aim to evaluate treatments for MVO (e.g. with vasodilators), our proposal is the only one which tests a strategy of direct lysis of fibrin-rich microthrombi in the culprit artery microcirculation, which is a major cause of MVO. AIM: to evaluate if low dose intracoronary thrombolysis given after mechanical reperfusion can reduce MVO and improve surrogate measures of cardiac outcome. Full dose IV tenecteplase (TNK) is an effective thrombolytic for coronary thrombosis but confers a dose-related risk of bleeding and is inferior to primary PCI (standard care). OBJECTIVE: to establish if intracoronary TNK is effective and safe when given during primary PCI. HYPOTHESES:1) As local delivery of TNK should pool TNK in the heart muscle, low and/or very low dose TNK will be effective at lysing the small clots which underlie MVO. 2) Reduced dose TNK will be safe. PLAN: a double-blind parallel group randomised placebo-controlled trial of very low dose (0.5mg) or low dose (5mg) intracoronary TNK (n=180 patients) will establish SAFETY (adverse events incl. bleeds) &amp;amp; EFFICACY (surrogate measures of cardiac outcome with MRI) in STEMI patients with coronary thrombosis. The study drug will be given after thrombus aspiration &amp;amp; before stenting by slow injection /10 min via the standard aspiration catheter. Cardiac MRI will be performed 2 days &amp;amp; 6 months post-MI. EFFICACY and MECHANISMS of TNK effect will be studied acutely with a pressure wire (index of microvascular resistance) plus 12 lead ECG (pre- and 60 min) and then 2 days later with MRI (myocardial perfusion score &amp;amp; salvage, MVO, INFARCT SIZE). Blood will be collected (day 1 post-MI) for FIBRINOGEN/D-DIMERS which will be explanatory measurements of TNK effect on coagn. (SAFETY). Health outcomes (death, readmission for MI, HF, acute bleeds) for EFFICACY &amp;amp; SAFETY will be collected (3 monthly patient contact &amp;amp; record linkage; mean FUp 18 months). The PRIMARY OUTCOME is CHANGE FROM BASELINE NFARCT SIZE at 6 months FUp, since INFARCT SIZE is a determinant of survival. A hierarchical statistical approach will be adopted; a test will be performed of higher dose TNK (5 mg) vs placebo (5% sig. level) and conditional on the high dose group being superior, then very low dose (0.5 mg) TNK vs. placebo wilbe tested. FEASIBLITY: Our site is a large PCI centre treating 800 STEMI patients p.a. Our MULTIDISCIPLINARY TEAM has expertise in cardiology, haemostasis/thrombolysis. The study will be run by our NIHR Trials Unit for 3.5 yrs. If intra-coronary low dose TNK reduces INFARCT SIZE, our study will have ADDED KNOWLEDGE by identifying a new treatment strategy for MVO, new understanding of the MECHANISMS, implying substantial health gain.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MC_PC_12037</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>D4FDB752-4E9C-491F-9C63-B7D7F6F95417</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cardiovascular</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>7135039D-2DB0-4D41-87B3-FA1C8D38E133</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>6.1  Pharmaceuticals</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
