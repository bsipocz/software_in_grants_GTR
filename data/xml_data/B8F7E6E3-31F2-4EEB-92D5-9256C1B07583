The prospects for greater stability, and meeting the SDGs on inclusive institutions and global partnership, are remote unless ways are found of working towards what Appadurai calls 'deep democracy': local activism by NGOs and movements combined with global networks working in partnership with states. Our networking will link researchers interested in Parliaments and public engagement. The priority will be to support the development of national capacity to study democracy in extremely politically fragile states with a focus on Ethiopia and Myanmar. We will partner with Forum for Social Studies (Addis) and Enlightened Myanmar Research Foundation (Yangon) to enable research capacity development by: networking and training; allocation of small, medium and large grants to researchers; mentoring in research methods and dissemination; facilitation of learning between grantees and support in advocacy; stimulating debate; and fostering multi-disciplinary co-operation. National researchers will be given support and opportunities to undertake high quality research on the links between Parliament and the People and collaborate with arts organisations. 

This three year project will enable scholarly innovation through: (a) The study of politics in fragile countries has been dominated by development studies and political science. This research will create opportunities for scholarship in arts and humanities disciplines, including anthropology, political and social history, and cultural studies (especially gender and sexuality); (b) While development and politics scholars, and organisations working on governance in the Global South, tend to focus on either civil society/citizens or elite institutions, this research network will address the relationship between them; (c) Although researchers from the UK and India will manage the project, national researchers permanently based in 'extremely politically fragile' countries will do research and influence policy-makers. We have drafted research themes with partners: 

1. Culture of representation: How do cultural ideas about effective representation, gender equality and public engagement emerge for elected politicians and citizens within specific cultures and histories? What are citizens' (or non-citizens) and CSOs' attitudes to Parliaments (national and regional) and politicians, what difference does gender and sexuality make, and how are attitudes changing? What conversations take place between them and how are they gendered through language, performance and ritual? How and why does trust increase or decrease between politicians and people? What is the potential for combining representative and participatory democracy, what incentives can be created and what change is realistic? 
2. History of exclusion and instability: In what circumstances has representation historically contributed to gender equality, the promotion of the rights of excluded groups, as well as stronger trust, peace and stability? Do women and men imagine the future differently and how is this shaped by their histories? What role does gender (including masculinity) have in political performance, violence and interaction? How do inequalities, rituals, language, self-confidence and claims of authority include or exclude people?
3. Imagining deeper democracy through media and the arts: How can national and regional Parliaments respond to people, improve outreach and enhance the relationships between politicians and the public? How can decentralization and the power dynamics between national and regional legislatures work more effectively? How can arts disciplines or creative industries (art, photography, media, social media, theatre) evoke emotions to transform relationships and influence politics in democracies? How can we measure these changes? What is unique to particular locations and what generalisation can be found across them?</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our rationale emerges out of a crisis in democracy. The most direct beneficiaries of our research will be scholars in extremely politically fragile states, with a focus on Myanmar and Ethiopia and a lesser focus on neighbouring fragile states. They will be supported to undertake historical, ethnographic, cultural (especially on gender and sexuality) research and to work with arts organisations to investigate through arts methodologies and/or amplify their impact and challenge the dominance of political science. In countries with limits on freedom of speech and the media, scholars and arts organisations can play an especially important role in political scrutiny. It will be the relationship between the public and both their elected representatives but also the institution of Parliament that will ultimately benefit most profoundly from this research. We are addressing their need for deeper democracy, enabling scholars to invite Parliamentarians to reconsider how to engage with people when fulfilling their role as representatives of groups with diverse and conflicting needs, demands and interests. Public engagement that builds trust, peace and stability can only be fathomed and reimagined with a sense of historical and cultural significance. 

Institutional development will benefit the project partners in Myanmar and Ethiopia and they will enhance their capacity to enable other organisations and researchers to develop their skills, knowledge, networks and potential for impact. We will promote equal opportunities to ensure that researchers who often face discrimination (on grounds of gender, youth, ethnicity, or distance from the capitals and other urban centres) are encouraged to join the network and given support to do high quality research.

The key audiences for our project will be scholars globally, Parliaments and CSOs in fragile countries, international bodies and research organisations. Sustainable impact hinges on world-class scholars and partners, carefully designed processes to ensure quality, and excellent connections. In what is being called our 'post-truth' world, but might be more accurately described as a crisis of knowledge, international organisations increasingly recognise the value of high quality research by scholars in Asia and Africa. An important part of this project will be to create and consolidate links between research and practice; across social science, humanities and arts disciplines; and within and between the worlds of development, arts and politics. This will increase researchers' potential for access to politicians and political institutions, influence over policy-makers and further support after the end of the project. 

The activities of this proposal to AHRC are based on SOAS/Hansard Society tried-and-tested, successful strategies of creating incentives, providing support, recognising national intellectual property rights and maintaining intense and respectful communication with national researchers in shallow democracies (Hansard 2017a). Although this scheme allows scope for developing relationships, we will be able to hit the ground running due to our existing and trusted links with Parliaments, researchers and NGOs in politically fragile states and academics, donors, parliamentary strengthening and governance NGOs/experts working on Parliaments across the world. Impact will be sustainable because we will have not only created opportunities for institutes, NGOs and individual researchers, but supported them in writing proposals, research methods and dissemination as well as through membership of a newly-established Global Research Network in Parliaments and People, thereby ensuring that they will be in a position to secure further support for their research and advocacy in the future. By using online technology for communicating across the network, we will nurture existing, and establish new, enduring connections between researchers and their supporters.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1843003</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7A743EAA-C65A-4611-AEE2-812775199AB2</gtr:id><gtr:title>Ethnographies of parliament: culture and uncertainty in shallow democracies</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Organizational Ethnography</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2d996d00a3da69096c458cd99cb8110d"><gtr:id>2d996d00a3da69096c458cd99cb8110d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Crewe E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5aaa6f4adad8b4.14167648</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/R005435/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>020361E1-B8CA-49FD-9149-27D31D21C7A3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FC4405D9-8A0D-41F9-B71A-A19C9CD0AEFA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ethnicity</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6C41006C-514B-4763-BE82-812123897818</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Gender &amp; Sexuality Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EE8091C9-38A1-47B0-ACDE-331864A8A453</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Law, Democracy and Development</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3CE20DB9-873E-489F-BBC7-3F05BD0D900C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>020361E1-B8CA-49FD-9149-27D31D21C7A3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
