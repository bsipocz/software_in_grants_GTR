Plasmas are partially ionized gases that exhibit collective behaviour, and may be considered as a state of matter distinct from solid, liquid and gas. They are ubiquitous in Nature and comprise most of the matter in the Universe. Compact plasma-based light sources have the potential to revolutionise time-resolved studies of atomic transitions and lead to dramatic development of new devices for medical diagnosis. Plasmas are key to fusion energy research, which may lead to an almost limitless source of energy for mankind's future. However, modelling complex plasma configurations presents many challenges for mathematics, physics and engineering. This unique workshop brought together a group of applied mathematicians and physicists for the exchange of ideas on problems in plasma physics. Mathematicians working in non-linear dynamics, differential geometry and topology, and numerical analysis possess tools that can open up new avenues of exploration in plasma physics and numerical simulation. Physicists can in turn help focus the mathematical work into areas of most relevance to them.

In addition to a number of keynote guest speakers, the workshop also included ample opportunity for contributions from early-career researchers and PhD students. Furthermore, numerous informal discussion sessions were held that enhanced the opportunity for developing new collaborations.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Leaders (from the UK and abroad) of broad range of topics in plasma physics, computation and applied mathematics attended the meeting, and it is likely that the exchange of ideas led to new developments.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>AE502127-44B7-4058-91E8-FF69D2731A2E</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5462546d124e49.71447833</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Energy,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/H00145X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>60</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>8C42F55F-1A1F-4ACE-B264-F6697518680A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Plasma physics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>02B9E893-AC2F-436D-BF88-28E1AC827F5D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>60</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Continuum Mechanics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5A153F61-85B9-466B-AC56-9B187EFF9AD9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Plasmas - Laser &amp; Fusion</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
