Controlled growth of metal nanoparticles in various naturally occurring and modified bacteria will be used to produce the required catalysts supported on cell surfaces.Previous work, has demonstrated that bacteria can be used as a catalyst support for nanoparticulate metals, including platinum and palladium. The process involves reducing the metal enzymatically from a salt solution over a bacterial culture, with templating and stabilisation achieved using biochemical components at the living/nonliving interface, followed by post-processing, which kills the bacterial cells but retains the special catalytic properties of nanoparticles. Such materials have been shown to provide selectivity towards desirable products in catalytic reactions including double bond isomerisation and selective hydrogenation, but at present there is a lack of understanding of why this superior selectivity occurs. One factor may be the crystal structure, including the ratios of edge to terrace and corner atoms which influence the adsorption of reactants upon the catalyst surface. Another effect is the rate of diffusion of reactants to the metal surface. This proposal will develop understanding of why the nanoparticles give rise to superior catalytic selectivity, and thus will enable the rational design and production of nanoparticles for given applications. The present proposal will seek to clean the biotemplated metal particles using chemical and electrochemical methods in order to control the metal cluster morphology, and to block selectively certain active sites on the catalyst using Bi, Pb, sulphur or bacterially derived agents incorporated at the synthesis stage. By switching on or off active sites in this way and associated characterization and testing of the catalysts, it will be possible to identify which types of sites are associated with favourable selectivity in chemical transformations.The produced catalysts will be characterized using a range of techniques which will elucidate information about the nanoparticle size, shape, cluster structure, redox behaviour, electrochemical and spectroscopic behaviour (SERS, XPS, XRD, TPD, DRIFTS and CV). Catalytic selectivity will be studied in a range of selective hydrogenation and double bond isomerisation reactions. The ultimate goal is to replace Lindlar catalysts based on lead modified palladium and other transition metals with more environmentally benign alternatives; previous studies in ours and collaborators' laboratories have shown that the precious metal can be supplemented with cheap metals such as Fe and can even be sourced as such mixtures from waste and scrap for economic manufacture.Current methods for nanoparticle manufacture are not 'clean' and/or not scalable. The major advantage of biomanufacturing is its scalability; we have routinely grown several kilos of the bacteria at the 600 litre scale in our pilot plant. As part of this project we will make Bio-Pd preparations at the 30-100 litre scale (batch cultures), checking the small-scale and large-scale NP products for conserved properties, and also stock aliquots for shelf-life evaluation.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research will deliver a highly selective catalyst, and demonstrate potential scale-up, which will be desirable to industrial companies for technology transfer and further development. Major industrial catalyst manufacturers such as Johnson Matthey and SMEs, for example Catalytic Technology Management Limited (CTML), are interested in alternative catalyst production routes leading to catalysts which display higher selectivity in industrial syntheses than their conventional counterparts. A first stage market research survey (CTML, University of Birmingham) indicated market niches and opportunities for commercialisation. The techniques developed under this project could potentially lead to manufacture of industrial catalysts from waste materials, including catalysts for energy production. This will lead to reduction in the waste of raw materials by using un-selective catalysts, recovery of precious metals (e.g. from jewellery or electronic goods) for recycling, and improved manufacturing of chemicals without undesirable side reactions. The project team have considerable expertise in technology transfer activities, particularly Prof Macaskie, who was awarded a London Technology Network Business Fellowship, which targets various networking and outreaching events to access potential collaboration and exploitation events. Kevin Deplanche (named RA), currently holds a Medici Fellowship (University of Birmingham) concurrently with an EPSRC Follow on Fund Fellowship, in which he develops a new class of Pd/Au catalyst and seeks market opportunities for the biomanufactured precious metal. Angela Murray is a BBSRC Enterprise Fellow, working within Macaskie's group, who will advise on technology transfer and media opportunities. J. Wood was invited to give a keynote lecture in Cairo, Egypt, by Sabrycorp, a Nano-technology consultancy company which specialises in introducing nano-tech in the Middle East. It is expected that he will make return visits, and that this could lead to dissemination and tech-transfer in Middle Eastern Countries. Wood is also working on other energy related research, such as upgrading of heavy oils (EP/E057977/1), and intends to seek opportunities for the use of nano-particulate catalysts in heavy oil upgrading, through future grant applications, and possible industrial collaboration. Letters of support have been obtained from several companies, who are aware of the project and its aims, such that commercialisation of the proposed nanoparticulate catalysts could be expected to take place 3-5 years after the end of the proposed project. The work will be widely disseminated through a range of events, which will include academic publications and conferences, technical presentations at subject group meetings (e.g. IChemE), media dissemination (radio and TV), and school visits. We will also bid for a Royal Society Summer Exhibition on 'Clean Chemistry' in 2013. A website, incorporating video on demand reports about the project, presentations and selected information will be set up. The technology transfer and intellectual property rights concerning the project will be managed by the Technology Transfer companies of the Universities of Birmingham and Cardiff. Alta Innovations is the Tech Transfer Company at the University of Birmingham, who will work closely with Cardiff, including applying for patents to protect the intellectual property rights generated under this project. The project will deliver three research fellows, who will be highly trained in bio-catalytic manufacture as well as skilled in surface analytical techniques, chemical synthesis and business development. It is expected that Joint Venture Licensing or spin out will occur around 2012, and product manufacture and first income streams would follow towards 2014. Further information about the impact of this project can be found in the Impact Statement, including a road map diagram of plan for delivery impact.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>341076</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project is ongoing. A range of biogenic catalysts were prepared at Biosciences in Birmingham. These have undergone further cleaning and characterisation at Chemistry in Cardiff. Catalyst testing is being carried out in Birmingham. A summary of findings of testing biogenic catalysts in the liquid phase is given below. Further testing will be carried out in vapour phase reactions, for which a test rig is being developed and built. Summary of findings in liquid phase catalysis: The selectivity towards1,4-butynediol hydrogenation of both a standard 5 wt% Pt on graphite supported catalyst and a biogenic Pt analogue is reported. In both cases, it is determined using cyclic voltammetry that step sites afford the greatest extent of hydrogenation and that deliberate blocking of such sites gives rise to significant selectivity in favour of the 1,4-butenediol product. For the 5 wt% Pt/graphite catalyst, irreversible adsorption of bismuth was used as the step site blocking agent. In the case of the biogenic Pt nanoparticles synthesised within the bacterium Escherichia coli, residual molecular organic fragments, left over after chemical cleaning and subsequent separation from the bacterial support, were observed to have accumulated preferentially at defect sites. This phenomenon facilitated an increase in selectivity towards alkenic products of up to 1.4 during hydrogenation of the alkyne. When biogenic nanoparticles of platinum supported upon bacterial biomass were also investigated, they too were found to be active and selective although selectivity towards 1,4-butenediol was optimised only after the particles were chemically cleaned and separated from the biomass. Selectively-poisoned 5% Pt on graphite (0.5 monolayers), although highly selective, gave half the reaction rate of the &amp;quot;cleaned&amp;quot; (most biomass removed from the Pt) biogenic platinum nanoparticles (20% and 45% conversion of starting material respectively after 2 h) but the latter exhibited less selectivity for butenediol (0.7 and 0.9 respectively). It is proposed therefore that such biogenic materials may potentially act in a similar manner to Lindlar-type catalysts, used extensively in organic synthesis for selective hydrogenation of alkynes, in which an additive partially poisons metal sites but without the associated hazards of toxic heavy metals such as lead being present.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The techniques developed under this project could potentially lead to: ? Manufacture of catalysts from waste materials such as scrap catalytic converters and electronic waste. ? Reduction of waste of raw materials in chemical manufacture through use of highly selective catalysts. ? Recovery of metals from catalysts for further recycling using microwaving or sonication. ? Improved manufacturing through selective production of desirable chemicals, whilst reducing the amount of waste produced. 


 The project is subject to a collaboration agreement between the Universities of Cardiff and Birmingham. Alta Innovations, the Technology Transfer company serving University of Birmingham University, will help to connect academic expertise and intellectual property to help solve industry-based problems. The Tech Transfer Offices of Birmingham &amp;amp; Cardiff have had 'hands-on' experience in working collaboratively towards a common goal via a previous Royal Society award. Deplanche/Macaskie have filed a patent application (BioAu catalysts) superior performance for selective oxidation reactions, and similarly patents would be applied for to protect the intellectual property generated under this project.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>56E03841-FE60-4A5F-8B55-71893B1029D0</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-7829504728.158475774d10e0</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>233A20C8-6639-4497-94AB-20A39D9D673C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Quantitative
