Tanzania?s future is increasingly urban and predominantly young, propelling urban youth to the forefront of its development challenges.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Urbanisation, however, has been accompanied by high levels of poverty, insecurity and inequality. Little is known about what this means for young people as they seek to negotiate the path to adulthood. In exploring the impact of rapidly expanding youth populations in the context of the urbanisation of poverty and its implications on the social and economic lives of Tanzania?s youth.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This research breaks new ground in exploring new perspectives and new interpretations of what it means to be young and searching for livelihoods in the city amidst endemic poverty, inequality and limit support. It will identify the strategies youth deploy in a context of urban poverty for survival and advancement, and how these are influenced by age, gender and geographic location. Youth participation and engagement in both research and dissemination are central to the project, including the design of new research methods that will provide an inclusive tool for engaging with youth perspectives on the issues they face. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research will be beneficial to multiple stakeholders, including those working with youth in programme and policy design and implementation (in Tanzania and the UK), Tamasha Vijana and its research team and the parents and communities supporting youth. Together, these influences have the potential to create a more supportive environment for youth, who are central beneficiaries of the research. 
1. For the government of Tanzania (particularly the Ministry of Labour and Youth Development) this research will fill in critical knowledge gaps necessary for designing more effective youth-focused policies and programmes based on the social and economic needs and realities of urban youth. The impact for shaping future policy approaches to youth is significant.
2. The influence on bilateral and multilateral organisations in the UK and Tanzania, such as DFID, UNICEF and the World Bank, is also high, in providing the information necessary for aiding decision-making and in emphasising the importance of mainstreaming youth more effectively throughout their agendas. I will strengthen the potential impact here by meeting with these users in the early design phase to identify their information needs and in involving them in dissemination activities in Year 3.
3. Research findings will serve two important purposes for non-governmental organisations working with and for youth, providing strong evidence and findings that they can use in: a) strengthening their advocacy work to promote youth needs at the policy level; and b) designing programmes for youth based on their social and economic needs and realities.
4. My host organisation, Tamasha Vijana, will benefit on multiple levels. Not only will my findings be useful to programme design and advocacy work, our collaboration will build the capacity of their research team and produce a useful dataset and knowledge base to guide their future research agenda. As well as training on the appropriate research methods, I will also plan to do broader training for capacity building with Tamasha's research team and will support them to write and publish in their own right.
6. Through the research process and findings dissemination, the research will challenge existing perceptions of youth among parents and community leaders. This will create a more supportive environment for youth and help these stakeholders to recognise the benefits of encouraging youth participation in household and community decision-making and activities.
7. Youth are at the heart of my research objectives and outcomes, and the research will ensure their participation and meaningful engagement at every stage of the research, from the design of research methods through to dissemination. Through engaging with youth to reveal new perspectives and interpretations of what it means to grow up in urban Tanzania, the research will help youth to reflect critically on the social and economic obstacles they face in their lives and to open up alternative courses of action driven by youth themselves. The research will extend this impact beyond research participants through youth-friendly findings dissemination, via Tanzania's Young Reporter Network and national newspapers, for example.
8. Research findings - both the conceptual framework developed and empirical findings - will strengthen courses under the Masters of Global Urban Development Planning and will therefore impact upon students and the University of Manchester in terms of improved teaching and learning outcomes.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>172285</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Sheffield</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Mapping the UK's NGO Sector</gtr:description><gtr:id>1DDFCB67-C912-49AE-87C9-EF61145B4140</gtr:id><gtr:impact>So far we are still in the basis of creating the database.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56c6eec09a7e37.26954383-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Dan Brockington is leading and managing the project from Sheffield, including managing a research assistant who is doing the majority of data entry.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Working with Professor Dan Brockington on a project to map the UK's Development NGO sector.

I presented my early findings of my research on youth and urban poverty in Tanzania at a joint conference between Bradford University and Mzumbe University in Tanzania on 50 years of development in Tanzania. Presentations were uploaded online so that students in Tanzania could also benefit. I have also given presentations at international workshops where there was a high attendance from donors and NGO professionals working on youth development issues, in the UK and internationally. I was asked to join an expert panel on The Guardian's Development Professional Networks on how NGOs can effectively lobby and ensure impact. 

I have also put a considerable effort into disseminating my findings widely through blogs, video blogs and newspaper articles. These have led to the University of Manchester putting out a press release about my findings, which in turn led to a Radio Interview with the BBC World Service. I will continue these efforts throughout the remainder of my Fellowship and beyond.

Lastly, I was inspired to use my research findings to help start a Social Enterprise in one of my research projects, working with young motorcycle taxi drivers. Through an innovative savings scheme, this is helping them to become owners of their own motorbikes, tripling their daily incomes and helping them transform their lives. The project design is sustainable, so benefits will pass onto another group of young men once this first cycle is finished. This offers a unique and effective model for youth development programmes that we believe other organisations working with and for youth will be well placed to scale up across the Global South. The University of Manchester has given me additional funds to research the project as it progresses and to produce a short film about the project, so that we can make sure that the impact of these efforts is realised.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>4841E685-89CB-42F5-A079-78364CB2C495</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>544a23ee8a7c31.18594699</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The first year of my grant I spent doing exploratory research into the lives of young people in my two case study cities in Tanzania: Arusha and Dar es Salaam. These fed into the next (and primary) stage of my research, starting in January 2015. Throughout 2015 I spent a large amount of time in Tanzania doing data collection with youth communities in Dar es Salaam and Arusha, which I am in the process of analysing now. 

The research highlights the difficult circumstances urban youth find themselves in. Despite the better educational and employment opportunities, infrastructure and services that cities offer their residents, young people find themselves unable to access these benefits. Their lives are instead characterised by poverty, uncertainty, and a heightened vulnerability as a result of the emotional, physical and sexual violence that surrounds them. 

Work opportunities are limited and of poor quality. Most young people find irregular work doing various odd jobs on low incomes, or earn meagre amounts of money in survival small businesses. Where young people cannot secure income they spend large amounts of time 'waiting' for economic opportunities that take long times to come. This situation is exacerbated by limited support from their parents, families and communities. Where the realities of city life do not live up to the dreams of city living, hopes and aspirations are dampened, and there are limited pathways to social mobility for young people to follow. The idea of smooth transitions to adulthood for urban youth in Tanzania is misrepresentative of the experiences of most young people.

My research also highlights the need to look beyond young people's current circumstances to include their future hopes and aspirations and their past upbringing into our analysis. Hopes and aspirations are critical motivators of actions and behaviours, and without understanding young people's longer-term development we cannot understand their current lives and opportunities. My research has revealed four psycho-social developmental processes that studies of youth development must pay greater attention to: building foundations, building blocks (developmental assets), building support structures and building dreams. 

I have presented these findings broadly at national and international conferences, to a mixture of academic, professional, and policy networks. Most notably here was my presentation to the Seventh African Population Conference in Pretoria, organised by the Government of South Africa. Throughout the two years of my Fellowship I have also carried out numerous public engagement activities, disseminating findings in an accessible fashion through blog posts, newspaper articles, radio interviews, and public events. 

As a result of this ESRC research I have also started up a project working with young motorcycle taxi drivers as an attempt to put my findings into action and give something back to one of the communities where my research was conducted (which so far is a success). As well as impacting positively on the lives of the six members in the first cycle, this also has other strong potential routes to impact. Firstly, it will strengthen the impact of my ESRC findings since I will not only be able to disseminate my findings to governments and professionals about youth poverty and unemployment, but also a tangible example of how we can take those findings to action. Furthermore, it offers an easily adaptable and scaled up model for those working with and for youth. We are researching the project as it continues and will disseminate these at the end of the project cycle with key stakeholders who we feel would be well-placed to copy or adapt the project.

Alongside this I have also been continuing to work on my other research projects. This includes work on NGOs and civil society with Professor David Hulme and Mike Edwards. From this I have also started up a new project with Professor Dan Brockington from the University of Sheffield that maps the UK's NGO sector. A recent publication on NGOs in World Development (the top journal in Development Studies) was in the top 5 downloaded articles throughout 2015 and has been well cited in these early months. This argues that while NGOs have expanded significantly over the past decades, this has rarely been accompanied by strengthened civil societies. Weak civil society roots, professionalisation and political restrictions all undermine NGO legitimacy and dilute their impact.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In terms of UK academia, I will shortly be presenting my findings at the University of Oxford in the Young Lives Seminar Series hosted by the ESRC/DFID-funded Young Lives project. As the cohorts they have been following have transitioned into adolescence and youth, they are turning their analysis into this new stage of the life cycle, and through these networks I hope I will be able to feed my research into this emerging research and literature to increase its impact. In terms of Tanzania academia I have also made connections at the University of Dar es Salaam and will see whether there is scope for collaboration on my return to Tanzania.

On return to Tanzania next year for the main part of my fieldwork, I will also engage with key stakeholders with these preliminary findings. These include the existing contacts I have made with UNICEF, DFID, Restless Development and other NGOs, and I will also try to extend my contacts to government policy makers. 

Lastly, I will also work with Tamasha Vijana (my host organisation) , a participatory youth development centre to engage with Arusha and Dar es Salaam's young people with these findings.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>BC47D0E1-E6A1-4D75-82F7-F81F353A853E</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545911cc588eb0.86704687</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Group Leader and Panel Discussant at Future Cities workshop, New Delhi</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0196EF8C-3C79-4F2F-A0B7-90F006E89FE2</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5465dbc17c2f49.78482252</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Interview by journalist for 'Udvikling' ('Development') magazine - the official publication for Danida</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F03B30F8-4957-4677-8EF8-D4804434879C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544a221030c7e3.72720643</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Setting up Rotating Motorcycle Scheme to help Young Men in Arusha Improve their Lives</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FD4E80C8-9F35-48F3-A39F-535E2E920C82</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As a result of my ESRC research I have set up a project working with young motorcycle drivers in Arusha.

So far the impact is limited to the lives of the first 6 members, but the model's sustainable and scale-able design will lead to it benefiting many more in the community. It also offers a model for other development stakeholders (local and national governments, donors, NGOs) working with and for youth for more effective solutions to the challenge of youth unemployment.
