Too often disabled young people find themselves on the outskirts of society. This is especially the case for one group of disabled young people. We know much about the deaths of young people with life-limiting or life-threatening impairments (hereby LL/LTIs) but relatively little about their lived lives. This invisibility is detrimental to their social and emotional well-being and mental health, and that of their families/carers and allies. This research seeks to forge new understandings of the lives, hopes, desires and contributions of disabled young people with LL/LTI. Our research will permit us to think differently about how society understands life and death, and will deliver forms of co-produced knowledge that will be useful to academics and to a host of civil society organisations, professionals and communities that are also seeking to value short lives and respect death as part of the human condition. Our inquiry is a flagship project of the Institute for the Study of the Human (iHuman) at the University of Sheffield (https://disabilityuos.wordpress.com).

According to the national charity Together for Short Lives, LL/LTIs considerably shorten children and young people's life expectancy. There are around 49,000 children and young people with LL/LTIs in the UK, and these rates are increasing year on year. Fortunately, young people with LL/LTIs are living longer than ever before, yet we know little of their lives; particularly from their own perspectives. This lack of knowledge is due to the marked absences of this unique group of disabled young people from public imagination and broader culture. Young people with LL/LTIs have been omitted from much academic research; are seldom explicitly written into public policy; are often excluded from disability communities and disabled people's own movements; and have their voices dominated by professional perspectives within palliative (end of life) care teaching, education and training. Whilst there has been work in the palliative, nursing and medical worlds on LL/LTIs, very little of this work has included, or speaks from young people's own perspectives. Consequently, critical questions subsist around personal, relational and collective well-being. This project is timely given that our previous research showed that disabled young people and their families/carers and allies experience significant exclusion and discrimination; exclusion which is currently exacerbated through severe austerity in the UK. Therefore, with young people alongside us as our co-researchers, and working in partnership with leading disability/LL/LTI organisations (Muscular Dystrophy UK Trailblazers; Purple Patch Arts; Action Duchenne; DMD Pathfinders, Together for Short Lives, Tinder Foundation), we will explore the lives of young people with LL/LTI as they experience and understand them, with the aim of making their lives visible. Young people with LL/LTI and their families will tell their own stories through multi-modal engagement with innovative art-making and narrative approaches. Working with our Community Research Partners and Expert Impact Partners we will co-design impact activities which ensure that research findings are applied and utilised in real life settings and thus are relevant, transferable, accessible and transformative outside of academia. We propose that this impact serves to improve the social, emotional and mental health and well-being of young people with LL/LTIs, and their parents/carers and wider families, enabling them to live life to the fullest.

Our project aims to value short lives and respect death through our work with disabled young people and the significant others that support them. Our project will be of relevance to civil society groups interested in humanity and the kinds of humans that are often devalued. Our commitment to meaningful impact fits the ethical, relational and political demands of high quality dis/ability research (Oliver 1992). Our key stakeholders in the research are, first and foremost, disabled young people and their families/carers and allies; but other key stakeholders extend to health, social and palliative care students, professionals and practitioners; community organisations and workers; policy makers; and academics and researchers. We are already using an 'Impact Partner Model', whereby our Research Management Team, Community Research Partners and Expert Impact Partners - and other local/national community organisations and related stakeholders - actively participate in a collectively-designed impact strategy (see Pathways to Impact). This enables Partners to take ownership of longer term key impact activities. Furthermore, our use of co-production and arts-informed methods enables an expansion of institutional meanings of impact as currently constructed academia, exploring affective/emotional, psychic, representational, artistic and educational forms of impact. Such possibilities are unique to research of this kind, whereby the power inherent to art-making can serve to empower, mobilise and politicise disabled participants (and lay audiences) as they imagine and construct new meanings of disability which run counter to dominant representations (Liddiard and Goodley, in press). To give an overview of Impact Activities in this summary, then, in the first instance we will communicate all knowledges from the research beyond the academy inter/nationally through a variety of knowledge exchange, mobilisation and public engagement activities. This is crucial in the context of disability research, whereby communicating, translating and disseminating new knowledges from research outside of the academy to disabled people, their organisations, and communities, and beyond, is politically, ethically and pragmatically important. Following this, we have co-designed with Partners four key impact activities which span a range of contexts and professional and policy practice (detailed in Pathways to Impact).

In terms of scholarly impact, research outcomes will make significant contributions to multiple bodies of knowledge, disciplines, fields of study, and methodological practices. To ensure scholarly impact we will draw on our exceptional track record of disseminating our findings across disciplines and inter/national contexts (see CVs &amp;amp; End of Project Report for RES- 062-23-1138). Mid to long-term scholarly impact will be made through i) knowledge transfer via the presentations at academic and practitioner conferences and events; ii) publication in leading, high impact factor inter/national academic journals; and iii) via the teaching of under/postgraduate students on psychology, disability studies, education and palliative medicine/nursing courses, managed and delivered by the PI and Co-Is and Research Management Team members across their institutions. Finally, this project will be supported by the Institute for the Study of the Human (iHuman) at the University of Sheffield as part of a wider impact strategy.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>443000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C7C44149-8868-4A38-B659-B02AFFA64E71</gtr:id><gtr:title>Feeling disability: theories of affect and critical disability studies</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Disability &amp; Society</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/837cb6ce9234993cdded17bb322a2046"><gtr:id>837cb6ce9234993cdded17bb322a2046</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Goodley D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a294384ea3e66.10078891</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/P001041/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>56C9394E-9F52-4433-9619-6A14493473A8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
