The aim of this research is to deepen understandings of child protection through focusing on social worker's experiences and methods of doing the work.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The home is by far the most common place where actual child protection work goes on, yet&amp;nbsp; little is known about how social workers behave on home visits, whether or how they interact with children, interview, examine them; or how they relate to parents. New insights will be produced by using qualitative methods of observing social workers doing home visits, audio-recording the social worker-service user encounters in the home and interviews with social workers after the visits about those experiences. Some comparative data will be gathered on how children are related to in other places, such as schools.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The data will provide for the development of theory and effective strategies for negotiating access to the home, how and where to conduct assessments, ensure children are directly engaged with, how to work with parents and intervene to create safety and effect positive change for children.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Accurate knowledge of how to go about protecting children is essential if practitioners are to be able to perform such tasks as negotiating access to the home to see and talk to children and their parents and to know such things as where is the best room in the home or other places to conduct such interviews. Research into such matters is lacking and this study could barely be more timely and its potential impact on policy, practice and lay understandings of child abuse and child protection practice higher. The 'Baby P' case which came to light in late-2008 has taken levels of public dismay and anger towards professionals when children die, especially social workers, to new levels, and intensified professionals' concerns about knowledge gaps in how to protect children. The results of this research will therefore be of great value to child protection agencies and national and local policy makers by providing theories and practical knowledge which can help resolve core practice dilemmas about how to relate to abused children in their homes and ensure they are safe. It will impact significantly on practitioners from social care and health who are involved in safeguarding children, especially those who do home visits, and also their managers. 

The potential benefits to social care agencies is that the findings can promote knowledge and learning about what practitioners and managers actually do and analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of current practices, systems and processes, which will provide the basis for developing (best) practice. This can have a direct impact on agencies in how they implement new Government guidance requiring them to see children alone in terms of how this is best achieved within the home, or in some circumstances beyond the home. 

It is hoped that the impact of the research on practice is such that the main and certainly the most important beneficiares will be abused children themselves. Because the research is intended to illuminate the 'intimate' world of practice and whether and how social workers relate to children at home in assessing their safety and well-being, children will benefit from the improvements in practice that the new theoretical insights and model of best practice the research will bring about. Parents too stand to gain from the help received from practitioners whose knowledge and skills have developed as a result of insights and training arising out of the research. 

Child protection is a highly controversial area of public policy, especially when it involves the deaths of children in cases known to social workers and other professionals. The commentary and debates played out in the media are invariably simplistic and this research can help to introduce greater understanding among the public of the complexity that lies at the heart of the enterprise of child protection, especially on home visits. I am a regular media contributor and can use these contacts and the opportunities completion and publication of the research findings will create to produce newspaper articles and do radio and television interviews which will ensure the potential impact of a better informed public can be achieved. 

I am regularly invited to speak to large audiences of practitioners and policy makers about child protection practice and the findings from this research will be presented at all such future events. My presentation of the findings at national and international academic conferences (see academic beneficiaries section) will also impact on practice because some of these events are attended by practitioners and policy makers, especially the ISPCAN International Congress on Child Abuse and Neglect, which I intend to speak at on this research in September 2013. I anticipate many requests from employers to speak at training events for health and social care professionals when knowledge of the research is in the public domain.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>80049</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Nottinghamshire County Council</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>CPD training for 200 children's and families' social workers</gtr:description><gtr:id>BC67A0B1-0474-4E87-99E4-1CB645427CC7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Improved social work and child protection practice</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e156cfb015d0.49071877-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>They have provided access to their social workers for research and some social workers come into the university to teach social work students.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The research findings contributed to a 4 day CPD training programme for social workers</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Developing Intimate Child Protection Practice, full day training Lancashire Children's Social Care, Chorely. 5th June, 2013.</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>312EDD79-DC06-4841-A240-54F25EDC3F22</gtr:id><gtr:impact>One of eight days training for Lancashire County Council social work and social care staff, between May and September 2013.
