&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>how socio-economic inequalities translate into inequalities in newborn and maternal mortality&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>how to address the exclusion of poor and otherwise disadvantaged groups from efforts to achieve the MDGs&lt;/li>

The study contributes to an understanding of how families in underserved urban communities with inequitable access to health services choose their health care. This important aspect of health service utilisation has received limited attention. Future health policies will benefit from a greater understanding of how vulnerable groups decide in a context of uncertain health care choices. The policy brief discussed recommendations which can help address inequalities in access to maternal health care and to improve the experiences of the urban poor.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56532f4d327de4.66116732</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/parliamentarians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://equinam.global-health-inequalities.info/files/7314/3740/6144/Policy_brief_B_final_SNEHA140715.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>'Engaging policy makers in research on inequalities in maternal and newborn health.'

The agenda was to discuss emergency obstetric services and referral system in its present form, the challenges faced and systemic solutions to improve maternal and newborn survival. SNEHA involved the former chief secretary of Maharashtra to elicit greater participation from the corporations. From the discussions that ensued an action plan was drawn up for every corporation by the former chief secretary that included action items such as a situational analysis of the health resource gaps in each corporation, organizing trainings for health functionaries, planning the existing health services such as ensuring evening outpatient clinics at hospitals, availability of adequate blood banks, etc

This Partners meet was highly successful and provided SNEHA a very effective platform to take further the agenda of better health for mothers and babies.

Our project was designed to have short, medium and long-term impacts at 3 levels: (1) data &amp;amp; evidence, (2) policy &amp;amp; implementation, and (3) research capacity.

(1) DATA &amp;amp; EVIDENCE

Using the most robust data available, our project addressed the paucity of evidence on (i) socio-economic inequalities in maternal and newborn mortality (ii) how to reach the poor in efforts to achieve the MDGs, and (iii) how to reduce socio-economic inequalities in newborn and maternal mortality. For details on this, see our Key Finding report. 

The methods for quantitative equity impact evaluation that we have developed in our project are now being applied in other studies - notably in a new large randomised controlled trial of an intervention to reduce maternal and newborn mortality. Also, in observational studies that our colleagues are doing, the methods for equity impact evaluation that we have developed are being applied (see also below under 'capacity building'). Our project has supported that such analyses can be done more systematically in impact evaluations so that gradually a body of evidence is being developed on how to how to reduce health inequalities. 

Our work on the equity impact of participatory women's groups (for example our 2013 paper in the International Journal of Epidemiology, a top 5% journal in our field - Houweling et al 2013, Int J. Epi.) has also been cited and/or used by others in the fields of equity research and newborn health research. A systematic review paper referred to our work as follows: &amp;quot;This kind of intervention [i.e. participatory women's groups] was also verified by strong evidence [i.e. Houweling, 2013, Int. J. Epi.] to have stronger effectiveness on reduction of neonatal mortality rate among the most marginalized women.&amp;quot; (Yuan 2014 BMC Public Health). An editorial in the Int. J. Epidemiology by Prof. Cesar Victora, an eminent professor in the field of health inequalities research, was dedicated to the same paper [Houweling, 2013, Int J Epi.] Our response to this commentary was also published in the same journal.


(2) POLICY &amp;amp; IMPLEMENTATION THROUGH STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

Through targeted dissemination of our findings and ongoing interaction with policy makers, we increased awareness among those in power, of the problem of large inequalities in maternal and newborn mortality and how best to address this. By providing tangible evidence on what works to reach the poor and reduce mortality inequalities, we sought to contribute to operational change in development activities, such that they reach those most in need, thus increasing the effectiveness of efforts to reach the MDGs and contributing to an equitable achievement of the MDGs. 

From the start of the project onwards we built up a basis for engagement with policy and practitioner stakeholders, by giving our project a clear identity (a project name (EquiNaM, which stands for Equity in Newborn and Maternal Health), developing a logo, communication templates (for presentations, policy briefs etc), and a professional website that serves as a platform for dissemination (http://equinam.global-health-inequalities.info/). The website provides easy access to project information and outputs; it is very frequently visited, and our project outputs are downloaded on a daily basis by people from across the world. Through the website, we also sought to raise awareness among stakeholders about the possibility to actively engage with our project (see: http://equinam.global-health-inequalities.info/index.php/stakeholder-engagement/). We developed project information leaflets (in English, Hindi, Nepali and Chichewa), introduction presentations about the project and about the problem of socioeconomic inequalities in maternal and newborn health. And the study was announced on websites of each of the project partners, including the UCL website. As the project developed, presentations with the latest evidence from the project, policy briefs, project updates, reports and international publications were added to the website. 

All the above facilitated project leaders and other team members within the study countries to act as advocates for equity in maternal and newborn health, and to raise awareness about the importance of addressing inequalities in maternal and newborn health. Numerous presentations were given, not only in academic fora, but in particular also to professionals and policy makers, at the Bangladesh Neonatal Health Forum, the Nepal Paediatric Society Annual Conference, and a conference by the College of Medicine and Malawi National Aids Commission. We distributed our project information leaflet to hundreds of participants at these and other meetings and at international conferences. Our project activities have received interest of the national and international media, including Nepali daily newspapers and The Huffington Post. 

From the start of the project, we actively engaged with and learned from stakeholders, drawing on their experiential evidence regarding what works to ensure an equitable improvement in newborn and maternal health. We were able to obtain additional funding for dedicated start-up consultations with stakeholders from a DSA-DFID New Ideas Initiative grant. The premise of this work was that policy-makers and practitioners have valuable experience of what does and does not work to reduce health inequalities. Unfortunately, this tacit knowledge is rarely written up and shared. We therefore collected, synthesized, and shared experiential evidence of a large group of stakeholders with real-life experience in policy-making and implementation. We conducted seven roundtable discussions in India, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Malawi, and 11 in-depth interviews with international stakeholders, including health policy analysts, medical experts, funders, national and international NGO heads, and government representatives. The key findings of these round table discussions have been reported in a policy brief, an interview report, and a round table discussions report which can be downloaded from our project website. The findings of these stakeholder engagement activities have also been submitted for publication to an international peer reviewed journal. 

In the third year of the project, we invited many of the stakeholders involved in the round table discussions and in-depth interviews mentioned above to our two-day international workshop in Kathmandu. We also invited several other stakeholders from each of the partner countries (India, Nepal, Bangladesh, UK) who were considered important to include after a second stakeholder mapping exercise by each of the project partners. The 80 stakeholders who participated in the workshop included practitioners (medical doctors, District Health Officers) and representatives of practitioner organisations (e.g. Nepal Paediatric Society; Director General BIRDEM hospital Bangladesh - the largest diabetic hospital in the world; director of Sravanga hospital Nepal), government representatives (e.g. Director General Dept. of Health Nepal; Assistant Director of Dir. Gen. of Health Services Bangladesh; Deputy Executive Health Officer from the Municipal Coorporation of Greater Mumbai; project director Community Clinics Bangladesh), academia (Director of the Institute for Global Health, University College London (UCL); global health researchers from UCL; Indian Institute of Public Health), and representatives from international (Save the Children, Action Aid, Plan international) and national NGOs (BRAC, ICDDR,B). 

In the workshop we presented and debated the findings of the stakeholder round table discussions and in-depth interviews and other evidence generated in the EquiNaM project. The workshop program included presentations and discussions on (i) setting evidence-based priorities to address inequalities in newborn &amp;amp; maternal health, (ii) how to partner with communities to reach the most in need, and (iii) the role of government incentive schemes and the private sector in addressing newborn health inequalities. Each session consisted of one or two brief EquiNaM presentations and at least two presentations by stakeholders, followed by a panel discussion including stakeholder and EquiNaM panellists. Using this set-up, we were able to actively debate not just the evidence generated in the project, but also compare and contrast it with and put it in the context of evidence and experience of our stakeholders. In the process, the evidence was not only translated to a broad non-research stakeholder audience, the workshop also strengthened a network of people and organisations who can make a difference around the issue of inequalities in maternal and newborn health. 

In working groups organised during the workshop, participants formulated recommendations for the Every Newborn Action Plan (the post-MDG international agenda for newborn health) on how to reduce inequalities in maternal and newborn health on the basis of the evidence heard at the workshop. These recommendations were published in the Lancet Global Health (http://download.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/langl o/PIIS2214109X14702712.pdf).

The Secretary of Health and Population of the Government of Nepal, Dr. Praveen Mishra, gave a speech at the closing ceremony of the workshop. He emphasized the importance of addressing health inequalities between different socio-economic groups and regions, through investment in health systems and through intersectoral action and by working closely with communities to reach the most in need. Many stakeholders at the workshop indicated their interest in further engagement. For instance one of the International NGOs based in India expressed interest in having a similar workshop around inequalities organised at the local level in India. 

As part of our broader ongoing work, all project partners sought to impact on policy making and practice for maternal and newborn health. For example, one of the project partners (SNEHA) has made an impact on policy for maternal and newborn health by organizing a major dissemination event of their ongoing work. The Maharashtra State Government Health Minister and some of his colleagues, chiefly the Health Secretary, attended the event. This was followed by the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai releasing a circular, officially adopting the clinical protocols for maternal and newborn health whose development was facilitated by SNEHA. The protocols fix the responsibility for holding regular referral meetings across levels of maternal and newborn health facilities. 

Effective engagement with policy makers in India, by our project partner Ekjut, has led to the start of a large initiative by the state government to scale-up participatory women's groups throughout the state of Jharkhand in order to reduce neonatal mortality and inequalities in neonatal mortality. 

Effective engagement by various project partners with WHO has led to WHO's recommendation on community mobilization through participatory learning and action cycles with women's groups for maternal and newborn health (https://www.google.nl/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwih4ebnj7bLAhUhDZoKHcmGCzkQFggkMAA&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fapps.who.int%2Firis%2Fbitstream%2F10665%2F127939%2F1%2F9789241507271_eng.pdf&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNHtoInDKjiFR-e1CKUYkSfAqJ8_7A&amp;amp;cad=rja). 

One of the CO-I's of the project (Prof. Anthony Costello) has, taken up a new position as Director, WHO Department of Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health, taking forward the lessons learned through the EquiNaM project and his broader, extensive, work on participatory women's groups (http://www.who.int/life-course/news/new-mca-director/en/).


(3) RESEARCH CAPACITY

Our project enhanced research capacity of our local partners, in particular capacity for health equity research, thus building a sustainable basis for in-country evidence building for policy making. Capacity building has taken place in the following areas: 
(i) Quantitative analyses &amp;amp; Stata software: Capacity has been substantially increased in EquiNaM's Quantitative Working Group, which contains members from all partner sites. The local researchers have been working with the PI of the project to analyse large quantitative datasets of randomised controlled trials for a broad range of papers. The local researchers in the trial sites have analysed their own trial data under the supervision of the PI of the project. The EquiNaM project, with co-funding from the Wellcome Trust, has organized three Stata (statistical software) equity analysis training workshops for researchers across the partner sites. The training included the use of simple and sophisticated regression techniques for equity analysis. 

(ii) Qualitative data collection and analysis methods: Members of our Qualitative Working group from all sites have received distance-based training, in the form of manuals, PPT presentations and online and Skype-based discussions, in the use of qualitative data collection and analysis methods, and in the use of the Nvivo statistical software. These skills have been put to practice through the actual data collection, analysis, and publication of findings in international journals. 

These trainings have allowed local researches to become local leaders in their own right in terms of equity analysis.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>D4C1FC7E-E25C-4E42-AC8E-23508D14D968</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56e1756ec4c6f0.79146153</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The EquiNaM project built evidence to support an equitable improvement in newborn and maternal health in Asia and Africa. The Millennium Development Goals have galvanized support to accelerate progress in human development, but improvements have been uneven and within-country inequalities between socioeconomic groups remain large. 

Little is known about (i) inequalities in outcomes that show the least progress, especially newborn mortality, and (ii) what works to reach the poor with interventions and reduce these inequalities. 

We addressed these evidence gaps using (i) data from a network of surveillance sites (Nepal, Bangladesh, rural and urban India, Malawi) with some of the largest population-bases of prospectively collected newborn mortality data in developing countries; (ii) randomized controlled trial data from these sites to assess the equity impact of community-based interventions; (iii) extensive qualitative research in the sites to explain our quantitative findings. 

We found that socioeconomic inequalities in neonatal mortality are large: the odds of dying in the first 28 days of life are about twice as high among poor compared with wealthier infants. Survival gains would be substantial if these within-country inequalities were reduced: if all groups had the mortality rate of wealthier infants, overall neonatal mortality would decline by around 40%. 

Underlying this problem are large inequalities in maternity and essential newborn care. Poor and illiterate women are far less likely to make at least three antenatal care visits, to deliver in a facility, and have access to emergency obstetric care. Socioeconomic inequalities in essential newborn care, like hygienic delivery practices, are largely explained by better care in facilities than at home. 

Governments in South Asia are introducing financial incentive programmes to improve access to institutional delivery care. Yet, our studies of the Safe Delivery Incentive programme in Nepal and the JSY program in India) show that poor and illiterate women are less likely to use these schemes. Our research in Nepal shows that financial concerns remain important barriers to institutional delivery among poorer women, despite the scheme. 

Community-based newborn health interventions are becoming increasingly popular. Randomised trials have shown that participatory learning and action (PLA) with women's groups can substantially reduce neonatal mortality. Our meta-analysis of the trial data shows that (i) PLA can address the exclusion of lower strata from interventions by reaching all socioeconomic groups; (ii) it is effective in improving health behaviours across socioeconomic groups in rural communities when simple changes can be implemented at home; (iii) by improving survival of all newborns, especially of disadvantaged infants, it can substantially contribute to an equitable improvement in newborn survival and towards targets set in the internationally agreed Every Newborn Action Plan. Our qualitative research shows that (i) soft targeting works to reach lower socioeconomic groups, among others by using engaging approaches that are easily understandable for the less educated; (ii) the social process of learning and action -leading to increased knowledge, confidence to act, and acceptability of healthy practices- is important for behaviour change in all social layers in a context where newly-wed women have little decision-making power.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings can be used for:
 
- Advocacy: Using high quality data, we demonstrated the public health importance of addressing newborn mortality inequalities. The internationally agreed Every Newborn Action Plan envisages a world without preventable newborn deaths. Efforts to achieve this will fail if the poor are not reached with effective interventions. 

- Policy making, and developing maternal, newborn, and community health strategies: We have provided strong evidence that participatory learning and action with women's groups can substantially improve survival of all socioeconomic strata, especially of disadvantaged infants. This low-cost intervention is effective in rural communities for issues addressable with simple behavioural changes. It can be integrated into and scaled-up through government community health programs. Based on the work of our UCL-IGH research group, WHO in 2014 recommended the intervention to improve maternal and newborn health. 

- Program planning and implementation: We have provided strong, tangible evidence on what works to reach the poor and reduce mortality inequalities, which can contribute to operational change in development activities. We found that soft targeting works to reach the poor with health interventions. Furthermore, a social process of learning and action, with long-term community engagement, can ensure behaviour change across socioeconomic groups.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D357DB52-05AE-4724-B5EF-A0ADB937B586</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>568fcd68d0f997.77694126</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://equinam.global-health-inequalities.info/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>EquiNaM Stata and equity analysis training III</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Asia</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6DC3FEEE-71CF-40BA-9208-F541B4E0F4F6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This third training further increased capacity of local health researchers in the Asia region to work with the statistical program Stata and to conduct health equity impact analyses.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56582c10e28684.47344627</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>EquiNaM Stata and equity analysis training I</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>575155A9-C00D-4B3B-906E-83CD1FDF1311</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The training increased capacity of local researchers in the Asia region to work with the statistical program Stata and to conduct equity impact analyses.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54650af33b0184.28384586</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>EquiNaM Stata and equity analysis training II</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AA29F443-8E95-4D03-82E4-6141225FFFE1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This second training further increased capacity of local health researchers in the Asia region to work with the statistical program Stata and to conduct health equity impact analyses.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54650b775475e1.96565082</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>We have developed methods for quantitative equity impact evaluation.
