In particular, the research will focus on validation of the swash and groundwater components of the models in order to improve understanding of the relationships between swash motions, beach groundwater flows and beach morphological change. The swash zone is the part of the beach alternately covered and exposed by wave uprush and backwash, where final wave energy dissipation occurs. Although this region above the still water level is perhaps the most critical in terms of shoreline management, it is the area of the nearshore environment about which least is known and is a difficult part of the beach to measure and model. The swash zone is highly dynamic and influences the morphological response of beaches over both short (i.e. storm) durations and longer time-scales. Erosion and accretion of the beach profile, and the resulting movement of the position of the shoreline, are a direct result of sediment transport processes occurring in the swash zone. The interaction of surface and subsurface flow regimes in the swash zone affects the morphology of the intertidal beach by controlling the potential for onshore sediment transport and deposition above the still water level, or transport offshore to the inner surf zone, and swash zone processes provide an important control on beach recovery in response to storms. However, the complex fluid and sediment interactions in the swash zone are not well understood or modelled. At present, most numerical models of shoreline change and beach morphological evolution either do not include sediment transport processes in the swash zone or simplify the representation of swash and groundwater processes to the extent that the predictions are not realistic. This failure to model the swash zone correctly means that beach profile evolution and sediment transport at the shoreline will not be adequately represented. In particular, models of beach profile evolution are not generally successful in predicting beach accretion. Since an accretionary event is defined by the deposition of sediment above mean sea level, the lack of detailed knowledge of swash and beach groundwater dynamics is an important factor in the inability of profile models to simulate accretionary events accurately. The limitations of swash zone modelling represents a particular problem in long-term coastal modelling, where coastal change is simulated over the timescale of years or longer. Swash processes are even less likely to be represented adequately in such models. When process details are not well understood, uncertainty is amplified as the number of variables and dimensions increase and as small-scale processes are integrated up to larger scales in both space and time. As a result, predictions of the long term response of the coastline to changes in environmental conditions must be viewed with caution. However, time spans of decades and lengths of coastline in the order of tens of kilometres are the scales at which coastal managers must take decisions, and there is a need to improve the representation of swash processes in such models.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Beaches are the primary defence against wave attack along much of the world's coastline. With flooding and coastal erosion predicted to increase significantly as sea level rises, understanding and prediction of beach response is critical to coastal managers. In particular, process-based predictions of beach dynamics and groundwater movement are central to the design of coastal protection schemes and coastal aquifer management. Continued improvement in the numerical modelling of beach profile evolution is important in the further development of 'soft' solutions to coastal protection. In addition, long-term prediction of sediment transport and morphological behaviour in the coastal zone in response to human intervention or to changing environmental conditions is an increasingly important issue. The research project will help to improve understanding, and improve predictions, of both short-term and long-term beach morphological evolution. Improvement of the short-term beach profile model (Li et al. 2002) will provide better predictions of beach crest height (and therefore the potential for wave overtopping), shoreline position, and beach profile changes. Further validation of the long-term model (Villarroel-Lamb 2007) will improve simulation of the evolution of coastal morphology, including the effects of storms, cyclone conditions and sea level rise, on the long-term behaviour of beaches. Better predictive capacity will benefit UK coastal managers and government through reduced expenditure on coastal protection works. In particular, the outcome of the research will benefit Defra and the Environment Agency, who are responsible for managing the coastline and reducing coastal erosion and flooding due to beach overtopping. The research will also be of use to coastal engineering firms and local authorities, who must devise strategies to deal with beach response to storm events, and to coastal groups which are involved in developing Shoreline Management Plans for beach management over the next century. The research will also be of benefit to Australian coastal managers. Coastal environments and resources are of great significance for Australia economically and socially, as over 80% of the population lives in the coastal zone, which is under increasing pressure in terms of resource management, ecological balance and infrastructure demands. The Australian coast is a significant natural resource for one of the country's largest industries - tourism - and is under increasing pressure for development. The Gold Coast, where the field site is located, is a particularly important area for coastal tourism in Australia. Researchers from Geoscience Australia, the national agency with the primary responsibility for research in coastal zone processes, will participate in the field experiment, which is also supported by the Gold Coast Council. Coastal urbanisation in the Caribbean region is increasing due to both population growth and growth in the tourism industry, and tools are needed for improved management of Caribbean beaches. By assessing and validating the swash sediment transport module used in the long-term model against additional field data, the model will improve its predictive capability of long-term morphology on Caribbean coastlines and will provide guidance for coastal managers in the region. All senior members of the team have close contacts with coastal managers in Defra and the Environment Agency and Australian governmental and research organisations such as the Queensland Department of Environment and Resource Management, the NSW Department of Environment and Climate Change, Geoscience Australia, and the Gold Coast City Council, and will pass reports and data directly to them. Information will also be provided directly to beach users during the field experiment. The COZONE network will also be used to publicise the project and disseminate the research outcomes amongst UK researchers and practitioners.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>6148</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Following on from this research, we have been working on processes on mixed sand and gravel beaches with Pevensey Coastal Defence Ltd. PCDL operates the only PPP on the coast, managing an area consisting of a mixed sand and gravel ridge along a 9 km stretch of coastline extending from Eastbourne to Bexhill, containing over 2 million m3 of sediment. Successful management requires reducing losses by minimising sand placement on the coarse upper foreshore. For economic reasons and sustainable development, the efficiency of aggregate production has to take precedence over the quality of its production. This means that a greater emphasis has to be placed on the improvement of placement and mixing techniques of the aggregate at the point of delivery. The modified rainbowing technique of Pevensey Coastal Defence Ltd is worth more investigation and may be considered for wider applications. We found that in a typical deposition mound, the fine material tends to migrate furthest from the point of discharge, with the coarser sediment remaining in the centre of the mound. Bulk sampling and grain size analyses at comparable cross-shore, longshore and depth locations within the mounds found that rainbowing deposited the coarsest sediments and least sand closest to the discharge pipe at the seaward end making it most suitable for placement on the berm crest. Sand was rainbowed furthest shoreward and to the longshore mound edges suggesting placement on the lower foreshore. Whilst this approach should reduce losses, a preferable solution is to separate sand by pre-processing, allowing placement of entirely coarse sediment on the upper foreshore and sand on the lower foreshore to match the natural sediment distribution. This sand may additionally be used to dissipate wave energy over the lower foreshore and further reduce losses on the upper foreshore. Reduction of the sand percentage in the upper beach or beach crest may be achieved in two ways: improved recovery technique at the point of delivery, and managed use of the sediment resources. The modified rainbowing technique experimented with at Pevensey is an example of the former, while the latter needs additional regulations by the government.

Our research showed without any doubt that the performance of a recharged mixed sand-gravel beach is closely related to the hydraulic performance of the beach. A mixed sand-gravel beach is likely to suffer much greater damage than a gravel beach of the same median sediment size. Compaction of the sediment due to heavy plant operations on the beach can greatly reduce the hydraulic conductivity and lower the critical sand percentage, thus enhancing the likelihood of erosion of a recharged sand-gravel beach. On the basis of this research, we recommended a number of key areas of research which would help to achieve better informed coastal engineering practices and more efficient designs in mixed beach recharge schemes. In addition, a number of areas of fundamental research were also recommended. These recommendations can be classified into two types, with the first having a direct impact on end users such as Defra and the Environment Agency and the second having a more fundamental nature that will in a long run benefit the end users.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2010</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>69372139-167A-40F2-9540-B29E7598EC4E</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5465859b4a1dc2.19160030</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Continued improvement in the numerical modelling of beach profile evolution is important in the further development of soft solutions to coastal protection. The possibility of modification of beach profile response through manipulation of the beach watertable has been recognised for many years, with the aim of either reducing beachface erosion or enhancing beachface accretion. Most studies suggest that beaches with a low watertable tend to accrete and beaches with a high watertable tend to erode, leading to consideration of the commercial possibility of modifying beach watertable elevation to control beach erosion. Our research showed that although beach groundwater level did influence beach profile evolution, the changes in groundwater elevation were usually not sufficient to change an erosive profile to an accretive profile or vice-versa. This suggests that artificially lowering groundwater levels would not help much in the control of storm erosion, but could promote post-storm accretion on permeable beaches.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Beach recharge has become a preferred option for managing erosive beaches, and most of the low-lying coast of southeast England is now being protected by beach nourishment, recharge, and recycling schemes. Many of these beaches are composed of highly permeable sediments, usually a mixture of sand and gravel. From an engineering point of view, there is an urgent need for information about the performance of recharge schemes using mixed sediments. When beaches are recharged using mixtures of dissimilar material, particularly sand and gravel with two distinct gradings, sediment losses can be high. A particular problem for management of mixed sand and gravel beaches is that mixed beaches lose more sediment than a pure sand or gravel beach under similar wave conditions. A major advantage of a coarse-grained beach is its ability to absorb wave energy efficiently over a short distance as a result of the large infiltration flow allowed in the beach. This advantage quickly disappears as an increased sand fraction is added to the gravel, as the stability of a mixed sand and gravel beach is closely related to the hydraulic performance of the beach, which is dependent on the sediment size distribution. Methods which help to reduce the amount of sediment lost from a mixed beach will produce both cost savings and increased beach stability. Improved predictive capacity is needed for cross-shore response of mixed sand and gravel beaches to storms and their recovery after storms. Beach profile models which have been developed for sand beaches may not be suitable for application on beaches where the permeability is sufficiently high that it affects water motions as well as the morphological evolution of the beach. Models which have been developed for a single sediment size may not be inadequate for mixed beaches in that they ignore beach permeability and friction and do not allow for the complex interactions between sediments of widely varying sizes.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E8BC7CB7-2367-4DE2-8DE0-35DF90AB951C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546583d3af5d35.86754050</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>DA81575D-8E1E-48BE-9EF0-85585ED873C9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Beach profile evolution on coarse and fine sediment beaches</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Proceedings of the International Conference on Coastal Sediments 2011</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/32ce9f7b1eba74e5e5c49a9458bd0a90"><gtr:id>32ce9f7b1eba74e5e5c49a9458bd0a90</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Horn DP</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5465451241d5c2.12547984</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>66FABD9C-2DBC-4C5A-A421-BFDF9AD68CDC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Dynamics and management of mixed sand and gravel beaches under rising sea levels</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Coastal Engineering</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/32ce9f7b1eba74e5e5c49a9458bd0a90"><gtr:id>32ce9f7b1eba74e5e5c49a9458bd0a90</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Horn DP</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>54654713c33a70.18450883</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>CB5E46B1-FF45-4117-8BA8-1AE8F5FE3A4A</gtr:id><gtr:title>High-frequency bed level changes on a coarse-grained beach</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Proceedings of the International Conference on Coastal Sediments 2011</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/1687d49f0e3ac620a97fbaae69f31da4"><gtr:id>1687d49f0e3ac620a97fbaae69f31da4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wiegand B</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>546545f06867f5.15026457</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/H026894/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>97FC8337-8E84-46A6-ACF2-A6047DA8C582</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environmental Engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>44BF93F5-71F4-42EF-A39B-8A0F09C7DDD1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Coastal &amp; Waterway Engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
