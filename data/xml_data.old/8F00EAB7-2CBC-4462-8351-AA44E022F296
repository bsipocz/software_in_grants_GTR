OA is a disease of the whole joint but one major characteristic is the breakdown of the articular cartilage, a smooth layer of tissue that protects the ends of bones and enables frictionless movement of the joint.

Currently there are no treatments that prevent the breakdown of cartilage and patients must depend upon simple pain killers, physiotherapy and ultimately surgical joint replacement. In recent years new therapies for treating OA have been identified (such as inhibitors of the key enzymes that break down the tissue), but the introduction of such treatments, has been hampered by the lack of specific tests capable of detecting early disease (where treatment is most likely to be successful), and discerning modest changes in disease progression following treatment (in order to conduct clinical trials). The current gold standard of OA assessment is by plain X-ray which is insensitive, and MRI which is a more sensitive and specific radiographic tool but costly and harder to access. The bad news is that although large pharmaceutical companies have developed 'safe' and effective drugs to use in individuals with OA, they have chosen not to test these compounds in clinical trials at the current time. There is therefore an urgent unmet need to develop a simple and sensitive tool to detect cartilage damage in man.

We have developed a human antibody that binds strongly and specifically to damaged cartilage and we believe that this antibody could be developed as an imaging marker for early OA. We have labelled our antibody with a fluorescent marker and shown that it homes to the joints of mice with inflammatory arthritis (where there is also cartilage damage). Our current proposal is to test this antibody in a mouse model of OA in which OA has been induced by surgically cutting the medial meniscus (leading to joint destabilisation). Two refinements will be made to improve the intensity of staining. Firstly we plan to use a near infra red (NIR) fluorescent probe, which has better tissue penetration and which also reduces background signal. Secondly, we will fuse two antibody fragments together which will improve binding of the antibody to the damaged cartilage and increase the amount of fluorescence that the antibody fragment will carry. If successful we will test this imaging technique in patients (in a subsequent application). The ability to translate this project to humans is tractable especially as the antibody was originally raised against modified human cartilage, and stains damaged tissues from human as well as murine arthritic joints. Translation of this project to the human is likely to have a significant impact on the development, validation and introduction of new treatments for OA.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Given the huge economic and personal burden of OA, there is an urgent unmet need to develop disease modifying OA drugs (DMOAD) that can reduce or stop the progression of the disease. The introduction of potential DMOADs, has so far been hampered by the lack of specific and sensitive serum and/or radiographic biomarkers capable of detecting early disease, and discerning modest changes in disease progression. The development of specific molecular methods for detection of early disease and for assessment of disease response to treatment is an important and tractable area for development in preclinical OA models. Moreover, these techniques can be easily translated for use in human disease.
The aim of this proposal is to use an optical imaging technology in conjunction with near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence labeled antibody fragment that is specific to damaged cartilage to visualise the development and progression of murine OA (induced by destabilisation of the medial meniscus (DMM)), and to validate this technique as an early marker for OA. The labelled antibody fragment to modified type II collagen was originally identified from a phage display library and has been used to stain damaged cartilage from both OA and rheumatoid arthritis joints. We have previously shown that it can be used as an in vivo marker of inflammatory arthritis by fluorescently labelling the fragment. We now wish to label the antibody with NIR fluorescence to improve tissue penetration and reduce the problems associated with autofluorescence. We will also modify the fragment by expressing it as a fusion protein, a diabody, to improve signal intensity in the diseased tissue. Ultimately, this targeted approach will be tested in humans with early (cartilage loss on MRI but with preserved joint space on X-Ray) disease.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The objective of this study is to develop a non invasive imaging technology, which is sensitive, specific, fast and cheap for monitoring the progression of OA. It will initially be developed in a preclinical setting using a murine model of OA, but ultimately it will be validated in human disease. The first to benefit from this study are the researchers and industry that are identifying targets for treatment, and validating new DMOADs. By using near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence labeled antibody that is able to detect small changes in the cartilage breakdown response to treatment can be monitored longitudinally and subtle changes in response to treatments can be measured. This has been a major problem up until now as the current X-ray and MRI detect late stage disease well, but fail to detect early changes occuring in the articular cartilage. Ultimately, this targeted approach will be tested in humans with early (cartilage loss on MRI but with preserved joint space on X-Ray) disease. If successful, this will have great advantages in detecting those suitable for early intervention and for monitoring the success of new DMOADs.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>258509</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Antibody Engineering Conferences</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E53DA70B-12F3-4B3E-B453-5CC60F9DAED9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I have been given talks in a consecutive antibody engineering international meetings : in one of them the number of participants were in the range of up to 1000 attendees.

This antibody can potentially become early molecular imaging biomarker that not only detect very early stages of osteoarthritis for testing interventions, but subsequently provide a mechanism for delivering arthritic cartilage-targeted therapy. Successful outcomes from this study will have a long-term impact on patients with arthritic conditions.</gtr:description><gtr:id>05AC67AC-8B09-4D05-ADED-E084B65ADA44</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Developing early diagnosis: 
Cartilage is one of the key tissues to breakdown early in the OA process. The strength of this development derives from the unique ability of our proprietary antibody that is specific to type II collagen (CII) post-translational modified by reactive oxidants (ROS-CII), to detect disease pathogenesis at very early stages, even before cartilage breakdown occurs in the superficial layers. Moreover, detection of early changes in the superficial cartilage layer by MRI is difficult. Consequently, this antibody may serve as a potential and novel biomarker for early diagnosis of OA. Initially this capability will be exploited in animal models of OA. Subsequently, we envisage use of this technology for human diagnosis in conjunction with MRI. Later, anti-ROS-CII antibody may also be used to enhance targeting of MRI contrast agents to the arthritic joints. This approach has already been utilised in oncology by fusing contrast agents to specific ligands for greater contrast enhancements and could be adapted for OA.
The antibody is specific to collagen type II (CII) post-translationally modified by oxidants present in the arthritic joints. Anti-ROS-CII immune-staining of human OA cartilage did not always associate to areas of cartilage loss, inferring that this antibody recognises cartilage alterations prior to overt damage and subsequent clinical manifestations. Anti-ROS-CII can therefore reveal very early and localised modifications in a crucial component of cartilage reflecting ongoing disease pathogenesis even when cartilage degradation is not present. We propose to develop anti-ROS-CII as a clinical trial admission tool for enrolling patients with very early cartilage damage into clinical trials, as well as for monitoring treatment outcomes.
Use in preclinical DMOAD Development:
i) Of special interest is the applicability of our technology to utilise the anti-ROS-CII antibody for imaging small animals in preclinical studies. This is paramount as none of the current technologies, including x-ray and MRI, can robustly detect early structural deterioration/progression in small animal species. This will significantly accelerate the development of preclinical development of DMOADs for use in man and has potential for veterinary application.

Development of specific cartilage-targeted therapy
i) Because anti-ROS-CII is highly specific for arthritic cartilage, the same antibody can be exploited to ensure local targeting of systemically delivered therapy specifically to the arthritic joint. Payload drug fused to anti-ROS-CII will be targeted to arthritic OA joints by anti-ROS-CII. This potent targeting approach will facilitate the use of systemic injections with improved efficacy and reduced off-target effects.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b05360620d15.85369891</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Molecular imaging for early detection of osteoarthritis</gtr:title><gtr:type>Antibody</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9485EAEF-7303-4A3B-9748-83BA25D1EAEA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Oxidative post-translational modifications and their involvement in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Redox biology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b5a991ccd29058ff03ed0255cfaa1dd1"><gtr:id>b5a991ccd29058ff03ed0255cfaa1dd1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ryan BJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2213-2317</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>545257bdb5f4f7.25392456</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>DE179E09-23B8-499C-A096-BBD4FA2917DF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Serum neurofilament light chain is a biomarker of human spinal cord injury severity and outcome.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/83e32726b549c2098d3bf923d1bc9afb"><gtr:id>83e32726b549c2098d3bf923d1bc9afb</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kuhle J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0022-3050</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>545257bd8b11f4.66103524</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D4694223-4E64-4490-B293-5A45B98ECEDE</gtr:id><gtr:title>In vivo optical imaging of early osteoarthritis using an antibody specific to damaged arthritic cartilage.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Arthritis research &amp; therapy</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/14de077670cd10324c06759df6364cee"><gtr:id>14de077670cd10324c06759df6364cee</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lim NH</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1478-6354</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>585d54831deba7.75548119</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>CA4BA99B-DA03-4B89-9586-D01D7A9675A6</gtr:id><gtr:title>Targeting of viral interleukin-10 with an antibody fragment specific to damaged arthritic cartilage improves its therapeutic potency.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Arthritis research &amp; therapy</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/3481efaa85ff4ab90b91befb940ddeee"><gtr:id>3481efaa85ff4ab90b91befb940ddeee</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hughes C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1478-6354</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>545256dec7b0f4.00258885</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B8FBD45D-55F4-435B-B013-A649331722DC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Autoantibodies to posttranslational modifications in rheumatoid arthritis.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Mediators of inflammation</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ff8364f998f47677591d07182f4f4409"><gtr:id>ff8364f998f47677591d07182f4f4409</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Burska AN</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0962-9351</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>545257bd642876.87580709</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/J002747/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>149FA87E-B8CD-4FFC-B515-EAD312BED03B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Musculoskeletal</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>89AE580F-2437-4540-9640-37005C968E67</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>4.1  Discovery and preclinical testing of markers and technologies</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
