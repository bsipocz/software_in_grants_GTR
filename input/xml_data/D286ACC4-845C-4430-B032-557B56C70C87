At the most malignant end of the spectrum, sudden cardiac death resulting from ventricular arrhythmia usually caused by heart failure and\or ischaemic heart disease represents a major healthcare problem. For example, some 300,000 cases per year are recorded in the United States stressing the potential clinical significance of treating those at particular risk. Supraventricular arrhythmias are also important leading to significant morbidity and mortality. Atrial fibrillation (AF) occurs in up to 1% of the general population and the prevalence increases eight fold in those over 80 years of age. It a major cause of stroke and can cause heart failure in the setting of pre-existing impaired cardiac function. Thus the understanding of the pathophysiological basis of cardiac arrhythmia and the development of new treatment strategies are important issues. Cardiac cells are electrically active and major sources of this excitability are ionic pores in the membrane known as ion channels that allow ions to pass down their electrochemical gradients. In this proposal I aim to investigate the role that a specific ion channel namely the ATP-sensitive potassium channel has in promoting and\or terminating cardiac arrhythmia. Specifically I want to understand if there are different subunits in various parts of the heart. If this is the case it might lead to novel pharmacological treatments for atrial fibrillation.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>My hypothesis is that inhibition of ATP-sensitive potassium channels in cardiac muscle is antiarrhythmic and it is feasible to differentially target sarcolemmal channels in the atria and ventricles. I aim to define the subunit expression and current characteristics in the atria and ventricles of mouse heart and to compare this with human atrial appendage. I will use quantitative real-time RT-PCR and western blotting to examine the differential subunit expression of Kir6.1, Kir6.2, SUR1, SUR2A and SUR2B in the various tissues and chambers of the heart. I will use patch clamping of single atrial and ventricular cells to examine any differences in pharmacology of the currents. My second aim is to examine the role of ATP-sensitive potassium channels in the genesis of abnormal rhythm using pharmacological approaches and in mice with cardiac specific deletion of Kir6.1. I will use programmed electrical stimulation to induce atrial fibrillation in the presence of ATP-senstive potassium channel openers and inhibitors and in Kir6.1 knockout mice. I will examine the electrical effects of the drugs in heart slices from the atria and ventricle of normal and Kir6.1 knockout mice and in slices of human atrial appendage.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>1. Likely beneficiaries.
a). Academia. There are a wide range of scientists in the UK and abroad who are interested in ATP-sensitive potassium channels in a variety of systems including neuroscience and endocrinology in addition to cardiovascular disease. Second, it is translational in nature and should interest both basic and clinical scientists.
b). Industry. Pharmaceutical companies have active programmes to develop drugs that modulate potassium channel activity aimed at treating cardiovascular disorders such as pulmonary hypertension and atrial fibrillation but also diabetes, epilepsy, neuropathic pain and psychiatric disorders. My research may identify a target for further drug development with eventual benefit to patients. Several clinically available drugs already inhibit or activate ATP-sensitive potassium channels and there are a large number of known pharmacophores. Knowledge resulting from our work also feeds back into enhancing training and expertise in industry. 
c). School and University students. Professor Tinker's laboratory regularly takes on PhD students, senior undergraduate students in Medicine and Science, vacation students from varied disciplines and Institutes (both UK and elsewhere) on Nuffield and Wellcome schemes, and school students on work experience schemes. The concepts and techniques involved in this project will provide an excellent entree into scientific research and methodology that should be of lasting benefit to them.
d). Staff employed on the project. I will benefit by gaining expertise in several widely-translatable research skills, including experience of presenting my work at scientific conferences and manuscript preparation. Mark will also enter a PhD Training Programme that will provide the Fellow with an integrated training through lectures and tutorials to obtain a broad education in cardiovascular disease mechanisms, and to develop the necessary laboratory skills for conducting the project. The generic skill training component part of this programme is the Barts and The London Medical School structured core (transferrable) and practical skills training that all PhD students of the Medical School must complete.
2. Types of benefit.
a). Academic benefit. This project fulfils many of the RCUK list of potential academic benefits including: enhancing the knowledge economy; provision of world-wide scientific enhancement; contributing to the health of academic disciplines by developing expertise and knowledge in a multi-disciplinary area; and delivering and training very highly skilled researchers. 
b. Economic and societal benefits. These most likely will derive from our potential interaction with the UK pharmaceutical industry. For example, Professor Tinker already has links with Xention and was a collaborator on a seeding drug discovery award to the Wellcome Trust to develop novel inhibitors of IKACh for AF. He also has an excellent history of providing highly-skilled and trained scientists for UK industry and Government organizations.
3. Timescale of impact.
This is difficult to predict but the fact that selective inhibitors for these channels already exist suggest that if the underlying hypothesis is correct it should be possible to begin a drug testing and development programme within five years.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-08-06</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>298475</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>National Cardiac Electrophysiology Conference (Birmingham, UK)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1FF83536-F883-42BC-94AC-808373AC4172</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I attended Heart Rhythm Congress which is the the national conference of The British Heart Rhythm Society.
