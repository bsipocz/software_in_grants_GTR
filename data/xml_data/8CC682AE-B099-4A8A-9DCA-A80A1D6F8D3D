Centre</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/R009724/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>One of the most important parts of the UK economy is the financial system. While it brings considerable economic benefits, it is also a source of significant risks to the UK economy as the crisis in 2008 demonstrated. It is of considerable importance for the UK to manage the risk of and to the financial system while reaping the substantial benefits, and the study of the resulting issues is of great interest to academia, policymakers, the finance sector and the general population.

The work of the SRC is based on the view that all financial risk of note is endogenous. What this means is that significant risk is created by the interaction of the human beings that make up the financial system, all with their own biases and resources prejudices and abilities. These interactions are modulated and amplified by rules, regulations, institutions and behavioural rules. By viewing the system via the lens of endogenous risk, the SRC is able to find unique insights into the nature of financial stability, identifying what policies work and don't work and meanwhile bring the academic understanding and financial stability forward.

The work has two main branches, understanding the drivers of endogenous risk (including uncertainty and networks) on one hand and doing something about it (macroprudential policies) on the other hand.
The first is models and uncertainty. The economist Frank Knight proposed a delineation of risk as separate from uncertainty. Risk is what can be measured and quantified and modelled with the statistical distributions. Uncertainty is none of these things. It captures the factors we know affect decision-making but cannot be quantitatively described with any great degree of accuracy, not least because risk is endogenous and subject to unexpected feedback loops. By viewing statistical models as capturing either risk or uncertainty, one gains significant intuition into the reliability of models for policymaking. The SRC is uniquely able to do this because it has access to a database on derivatives used for the internal validation of models within the financial industry, and will use that data to create new methods for uncertainty in decision-making. The SRC also has unique capabilities of connecting such uncertainty to the way the resulting behaviour endogenously results in certain connections and pathways through which risks build up and propagate.

The second branch on management of risk is macroprudential policies and procyclicality. Macroprudential policies or macropru, is the formal name given to government policies aiming to contain the endogenous risk emanating from the financial system. It is of primary importance and has a considerable focus within policymaking bodies such as the Bank of England. The aim of this research is to go into two related directions: to expand the academic knowledge of financial stability and systemic risk and to create practical methods to impact on policymaking. This branch has four sub streams. First, what is known as fintech, or financial technology, where the SRC will focus on technologies such as crypto currencies and blockchain and how that affects the stability of the financial system, including how those technologies can be used to mitigate risk. The second is research on the drivers on procyclicality, the deep forces that amplify the financial cycles, creating booms and busts. The third sub stream focuses on the political limitations to implement effective policies and how the structure of the political system, including the degree of democracy, affect the ability to implement effective policies. The final stream is on the forward-looking indicators of systemic risk. This builds on existing research at the SRC, but also incorporates the development of new theories and identification of empirical methodologies.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Deeper understanding of financial models and their problems significantly influences the effectiveness of financial regulations. Non-academic beneficiaries are the Bank of England (BoE), the Treasury, its international counterparts (like the Banque de France and European Central Bank), and supra-national organisations like the Financial Stability Board, Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and International Monetary Fund (IMF). We already work with the IMF and BoE on stress-testing and this research will incorporate the procyclical feedback of shocks on models and network connections, followed by further forced sales leading to losses and avoidable uncertainty. CI Zigrand sits on the BoE Macroprudential Advisory Panel. Model uncertainty and interconnectedness are crucial in the design of macroprudential tools, and the BoE is actively exploring this work with us. Policymakers seek research that condenses vast data into signals for early warning signs of group-think or of dangerous disagreement.

The CIs advise government, policymakers, including select committees and EU bodies, extensively in this area. We are confident that the future regulatory agenda both in the UK and elsewhere will bring with it many opportunities where academic excellence will bring much needed evidence to the policy making process.

The research will benefit the private sector, including pension funds, asset managers, sovereign wealth funds, banks and other financial institutions that take risk for clients or for their own books and need to understand how such risks depend on financial models and on the homogeneity of models and holdings. They will see how models interact in adverse situations and how the connectivity structure can amplify shocks, and may help them in avoiding events like the 2007 quant crisis when quant funds realised that many more were operating under the same models, strategies and funding constraints. Providers of financial information, e.g. IHS Markit, will be able to develop new products providing valuable information and early-warning systems for financial instability to their private users.

The SRC maintains an excellent network of policymakers, incl. BoE (Andy Haldane, chief economist and executive director, Alex Brazier, executive director financial stability), ECB (Vitor Const&amp;acirc;ncio, Vice-President; Yves Mersch, Member of Executive Board), IMF (Miguel Segoviano, European Department), BIS (Hyun Song Shin, Economic Adviser and Head of Research) and private companies in the financial sector, incl. Aviva (Angela Darlington, Chief Risk Officer), AXA (Christian Thimann, Group Head), Deutsche Bank (Stuart Lewis, Chief Risk Officer), J.P. Morgan (Olivier Vigneron, Chief Risk Officer EMEA and Firmwide Risk Executive for Market Risk), Blackrock, Deutsche B&amp;ouml;rse (Kengeter, CEO), IHS Markit (Lance Uggla, President) who have an interest in systemic risk, expressed in their interactions with us.

Apart from these lead users, we also like to appeal to the end-users. In a time of uncertainty and regulatory changes, with more similarity in regulation for banks, insurers, asset managers, increased marking-to-market and margining and ringfencing of retail banking arms, the right diversity of models and connections in finance will be essential to the well functioning of financial flows to their most productive uses. The research into diversity of models will positively affect the prosperity and stability of the City of London and the UK in general by showing the extent to which different financial actors in the UK are needed to contribute to a stable financial eco-system and by providing tools to regulators and actors to monitor this diversity and make it a force for good.

Our research is disseminated in many different ways, leading to valuable feedbacks and on-going relationships. Over the last few years, our events have drawn nearly 9000 visitors to the SRC, diffusing our work well beyond academia.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2023-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>960681</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/R009724/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5A4E8C76-15D3-44F2-9A84-72ADCE4DC97D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Econometrics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BF887C15-B29F-4C4C-8420-88AF17A8FFE1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Financial economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>085E9E17-60A5-4B2D-B9C5-F950A45872C5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Law and economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>249FA81B-498A-424B-9C57-C9BC20E4F688</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Macroeconomics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
