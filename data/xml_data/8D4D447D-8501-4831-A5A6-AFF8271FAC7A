Patterns of service and modes of delivery are expected to change in response to drivers including:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>increasing demand; spiralling costs of provision&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>reductions in public spending&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>policy initiatives to promote self-directed support and shift the balance of care.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Modelling can facilitate evaluation and interrogation of the third sector contribution, estimation of optimal mixes of services, and identification of service growth and capacity issues, but requires adequately robust inputs.&lt;br />&lt;br />The study reviews literature on service output evaluation and uses case studies to assess the ability of different approaches to illuminate services? wider contributions to care, including substitution effects. It identifies organisation and sector level information requirements for modelling, reviews existing datasets and data capture mechanisms, surveys third sector providers, identifies gaps and makes recommendations. Findings will be of particular value to local and national policy makers and planners seeking to better understand the contribution of the third sector to health and social care provision.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-05-23</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>22622</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Meeting with Evaluation Services Scotland</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>24DCE1E4-71E9-408A-862E-6484768F38C7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Meeting requested by Diane Kennedy of Evaluation Servies Scotland to discuss Fellowship findings, 'micro-mapping' techniques, and issues related to preventative service use.

STSRF is an invited group chaired by a representative of the Scottish Government's Third Sector Division with a remit to take a holistic oversight of third sector research and evidence needs, within the context of general issues and priorities within the sector. Members include representatives of a range of third sector intermediaries bodies, in particular the strategic partners of the Third Sector Division, including SCVO, COSLA, Scottish Social Enterprise Coalition, Volunteer Development Scotland, CEiS, ACOSVO (Association of Chief Officers of Scottish Voluntary Organisations), Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE). The STSRF collaborates and shares ideas on the research and evidence needs for the third sector. The Forum meets on a quarterly basis. 



I gave an oral presentation to the Forum's quarterly meeting. I introduced the Fellowship work and the concept of micro-simulation modelling and how it might be applied in this context.

It was organised as a Fellowship final event, and took place from 2.30pm to 4pm on 1 March 2012 at 'The Gathering 2012', a two-day conference and exhibition held at the SECC, Glasgow. The Gathering is a unique Scotland-based, free event that brings together all parts of the third sector. With 3000+ visitors it is the largest event of its kind in the UK. The event was chaired by Ruchir Shah, Policy Manager, Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations (SCVO). SCVO were the third sector partner for this Fellowship. Mr Shah was the Placement Fellow's primary contact in SCVO and chaired the session as part of SCVO's contribution to the Fellowship. The speakers/panellists were: Alison Dawson, ESRC 3rd Sector Placement Fellow; Mary Sinclair, Research Manager, Glasgow Council for Voluntary Services; Professor David Bell, Professor of Economics, University of Stirling; and Gareth Allen, Head of Intra-Government team, Third Sector Division, Scottish Government. Approximately 35 people attended the event, representing a mix of third sector organisations, local authorities and central government.

The chaired panel event led to contact from and requests for information from Evaluation Services Scotland.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-5861685458.4419032b4bf31e</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited meeting with Glasgow Council for Voluntary Services and Scottish Government Third Sector Division</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2C6693C1-08C3-46D1-9CCF-03E0FDC4966D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Meeting with: Chief Executive Officer and Information Manager of Glasgow Council for Voluntary Services; Head of Intra-Government team, Third Sector Unit, Scottish Government; consultant from Evaluation Services Scotland.

? There are two particular challenges in quantifying the relationship between provision of preventative services and use of formal health and social care services. The first is specification: standardised measures need to be developed which can potentially reflect the value of preventative service provision. The literature suggests that these are currently specified on a case-by-case basis. The second challenge is attribution: establishing how much of the variation in formal service use is due to using preventative services rather than other factors. 



? Quantifying relationships becomes increasingly complex when considering preventative services in aggregate. Data collection becomes more difficult, attribution is problematic and frequently contested, and findings can appear contradictory. For example, the evaluation of the Department of Health-funded 'Partnership for Older People Projects' (PoPP) initiative in England by PSSRU (2009) suggested reductions in hospital stays and outpatient services use with consequent cost savings, whilst the analysis of 8 projects within PoPP by Steventon et al (2011) found no reduction in emergency hospital use. 



? Existing data sources on Scottish third sector preventative service provision are limited and detailed data needed for modelling are lacking. Data collection is expensive, and with more than 45,000 organisations the Scottish third sector is vast. Targeted one-off data collections (e.g. GCVS' 'Reshaping Care for Older People Glasgow Third Sector Mapping' dataset) and regular but relatively small-scale general collections (e.g. SCVO's biannual Panel Survey) are available, but in order to better understand the contribution of preventative services provided by the third sector to formal services use a more targeted, comprehensive and regular data collection is required.



? An examination of more recently adopted evaluation methodologies such as Social Return on Investment (SROI) suggests that data collected by third sector organisations carrying out such evaluations might provide a potentially useful source of data going forward. However, those evaluation methodologies which would produce the best data are time-consuming, can be expensive, and may not meet the requirements of smaller organisations. As a result they are not yet widely used across the Scottish third sector. In addition problems with specification would remain as such evaluations do not incorporate standard specifications of measures relevant to this purpose.



? Models of future care provision need to take into account both availability/accessibility and how older people make choices about service use. The impact of individuals' knowledge of and subjective choices regarding the use (or non-use) of different services is not well known, and is likely to mediate the relationship between preventative service provision and formal service use in a given area.</gtr:description><gtr:id>1B29737D-E23E-451F-83DB-C82BEB8C7830</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-6359698368.571418b2f348fc</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software)</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-173-27-0233</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/I030182/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
