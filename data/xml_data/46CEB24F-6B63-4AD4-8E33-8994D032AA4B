Investigating Change in Alternative Organizations</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/N001559/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The economic instability and uncertainty created by the 2008 financial crisis has encouraged many individuals and groups to re-evaluate the type of society that they wish to live and work within. Evidence increasingly shows that workplaces with less hierarchy, more democracy and greater employee empowerment can not only ensure a more balanced and sustainable economy but can lead to a healthier and happier workforce. The opportunity to work in organizations with fair rates of pay, rights to participate in decision making and the freedom to craft your own job without managers interfering should no longer be seen as a remote possibility. Numerous employee owned companies including Accord and Tullis Russell, and co-operatives such as Suma and Infinity, operate in a way that claim to make these things a reality. Many more companies are going yet further, embracing radical decision making procedures that re-distribute power away from managers ensuring that employees are treated, remunerated and rewarded in a fair manner. 

However, for those traditional organizations tempted to make the transition to operate in a more democratic way, it is not a simple and straightforward path to take. Transformational change is notoriously risky and unpredictable and new companies feel particularly vulnerable, perhaps convincing them to stick with the familiar. Despite a government bill in 2012 supporting the development of co-operatives and calls for a 'John Lewis society' reflecting a more moral and responsible capitalism, various obstacles stand in the way of companies wishing to make the change. One of the main problems is that here is a lack of information available to firms about what to expect when initiating the transition to become alternative organizations. In short, there was - and there remains - not enough research being conducted in to: a) how organizations can make the transition from top-down hierarchical workplaces to adopt more democratic structures with increased employee power; and b) the opportunities and challenges that organizations face once they have made the transition and are attempting to initiate and pursue change with less hierarchy and more employee freedom and control. This lack of evidence about change makes it a much riskier and unpredictable process for those considering whether to embrace different models of organization in the workplace, and holds back progress leaving the economy unbalanced.

This research project will provide this much needed research across a wide range of democratic companies. It will capture and document the experience of 'alternative' organizations and their members as they initiate, and pursue change within the workplace. In doing so, it will provide a radical exploration of the opportunities and challenges faced by employees, elected leaders, coaches and HR professionals whilst adopting and sustaining a democratic organization. Interviews, observation and action research will be used to go inside 24 democratic workplaces and consider how elected leaders facilitate change in contrast to conventional organizations; to what extent employees are free to initiate and pursue change and what constraints they experience in these types of organizations; and how these organizations increase and decrease freedom and accountability in various ways for individuals and groups. By working closely and co-producing research with practitioners in alternative organizations, this project will extend knowledge about change in democratic workplaces. It will broaden the evidence base for workplaces wishing to make the transition away from traditional top-down, hierarchical modes of operation by ensuring that they are fully aware of the challenges and opportunities they are likely to encounter and are better placed to deal with them in innovative and beneficial ways.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The central impact of the project will be to develop a critical tools for change that can be used by organizations wishing to become more democratic. The PI will work with democratic organizations and practitioner-facing organizations championing democracy in the workplace, to increase knowledge and awareness about the most effective ways that alternative organizations are created and sustained. Consequently, there are numerous beneficiaries, such as the 24 alternative organizations being studied: 

Equal Exchange (Co-operative, 120 worker owners, fair trade coffee; RI, USA) 
Suma (Co-operative; 150 worker owners; wholesale foods; Leeds, UK) 
Unicorn (Co-operative; 100 worker owners; grocery; Manchester, UK) 
Infinity foods (Co-operative; 100 worker owners; Caf&amp;eacute; and food supplier; Brighton, UK)
Tullis Russell (Co-operative; 750 worker owners; paper supplier; Fife, UK) 
Leeds Bread (Co-operative; 5 worker owners; Bakery; Leeds, UK)
Gripple(Employee owned; 220 employees; wire and tensioner suppliers; Sheffield)
Loadhog (Employee owned; 50 employees; Packaging contractors Sheffield, UK)
Parfetts (Employee owned; 550 employees; cash and carry company; Stockport, UK) 
Accord (Employee owned; 20 employee; energy company; Aberdeen, UK)
Springest (Holacracy; 40 employees; educational provision website; Amsterdam, Holland)
Best upon request (Holacracy; 200 employees; concierge business; OH, USA)
Kahler (Holacracy; 15 employees; financial services; SD, USA)
Centre for Human Emergence (Holacracy; 20 employees; solutions; Utrecht; Holland) 
Netcentric (Holacracy; 140 employees; technology consultants; Munich, Germany)
Concept7 (Holacracy; 50 employees; car manufacturing/design company; Groningen, Holland)
Propellernet (Democratic; 50 employees; website and marketing consultants; Brighton, UK) 
Surevine (Democratic; 50 employees; digital security; London, UK) 
Nixon McInnes (Democratic; 20 employees; marketing consultants; Brighton, UK)
Outlandish (Democratic; 10 employees web design consultancy; London, UK)
4 x Sociocratic companies- access to be provided by the Sociocracy Consulting Group (See letter). 

As the letters of support for each organization suggest, all of these workplaces believe that the results of the study will help them to learn and develop their own practice as alternative organizations. The workers, leaders and HR professionals within will be able to reflect on various experiences of change in alternative organizations, not only through the production of the practitioner manual and the project website but through the general strengthening of the community from which they can draw upon to share and improve practice. Beyond this initial impact, the research will have impact on other organizations who are interested in becoming more democratic. These organizations will be reached through the dissemination events and impact advisory board members who are leading figures in organizations such as Co-operatives UK, Employee Ownership Association and the WorldBlu network of democratic companies. 

In addition to this, the coaching organizations will benefit from the research project as it will allow them to reflect and share on their own practice. These 9 organizations are:

Cooperative Assistance Network (Co-operatives) 
Co-ownership solutions (Employee Ownership)
Realize (Holacracy)
HolacracyOne (Holacracy)
CID Partners (Holacracy)
Sociocracy Consulting Group (Sociocracy)
Synnervate (Democracy)
Conscious Business (Democracy) 
World Blu (Democracy)

The coaching organizations and coaches have also agreed to contribute to the development of the practitioner manual. World Blu will be directly co-producing research outputs on the project and distributing data to their members and through their web pages. They have a unique insight in to change within alternative organizations and in combination with the PI will help to increase the impact of the project significantly.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>210461</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>At present the grant has contributed towards the creation and development of a collaboration between academics, consultants and leaders within alternative organisations called the Healthy Power Alliance (see http://healthypoweralliance.org). The PI is a &amp;quot;top circle&amp;quot; member (board member) of this group and has used the findings from the 1st year of the study on coaching within alternative organisations to inform its development. A conference paper has been developed about the development of this group and the difficulties of collaborating between these various parties (most notably the different and often conflicting goals of these different parties). More details of this are available in another section of this submission. The development of the HPA is ongoing.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>F23BA076-703F-4BE6-B4F1-9DBF44937BD3</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>58c6c801d47944.84587885</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N001559/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4FE4E471-D6BD-451C-B7BE-F13520DD3883</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Organisational Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
