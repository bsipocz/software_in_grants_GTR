The context of the research focuses on the particular contemporary position of Europe and its armed forces.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>While the change in the way that European?s think about their militaries has been changing since the end of the Cold War, more recent issues have put Europe?s militaries in crisis. The first and perhaps most significant for everyday lives is the global financial crisis, which has had a large effect on government budgets and in particular defence budgets. At the same time, militaries face developments in strategic doctrine. We see evidence that European militaries are beginning to innovate towards a ?network centric? (or enabled) model by incorporating the US modernisation agenda into their development. On the grander scale, changes in the trans-Atlantic might explain changes in European security forces. Europe and NATO are left in a crisis.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Looking at these factors, we compare eight case studies:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>Belgium&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>France&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Germany&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Great Britain&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Italy&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Norway&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Poland&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Spain&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>What impact is planned for this project? The primary theoretical argument is that Europe's militaries are becoming 'smarter' nor 'poorer' as they transition to manage challenges to national defence. The underlying policy relevant argument is that the fiscal crisis and changing geo-politics provides a political opportunity for states to modernise their combat forces by progressing from 'platform centric' to 'network centric' operations. As a result, this project will make recommendations on assets, unit structure and combat scenarios as generated by the theoretical and empirical findings of the project. The engagement and communication of these recommendations will be discussed below.

With the policy implications of the project in our scopes, we involve stake-holders throughout the project process. Following on from funding from the Engineering, Physical Sciences Research Council (PI Galbreath), we have developed a working relationship with the Land Warfare Centre at Warminster who have made a major contribution to modernising strategic doctrine along the lines of incorporating a 'network centric' approach to warfare at the strategic and operational levels. For this reason, our starting point and primary contribution would be with and on the British defence context and secondarily to European militaries. At the British level, we are keen to examine the nature and added-value of the UK-France defence cooperation agreement on the drivers of strategic change. for this reason, we have established contacts in the MoD. UK stake-holders will be represented on the project steering committee.

Relevant UK stake-holders are:
UK Ministry of Defence
Defence Science and Technology Laboratory
British Army Land Warfare Centre

Furthermore, we have focused on Poland, Denmark and Benelux as other countries (or groups of countries) that have the potential to gain specific policy-relevant contributions from this research project. We will bring this wider circle of stake-holders into the project during the impact and output phases.

Relevant international stake-holders are:
Ministry of Defence in -
Belgium
Denmark 
Estonia 
France 
Germany 
Great Britain
Italy
Netherlands 
Norway
Poland
Spain 
Sweden

A major question for policy-makers in this financial and political environment is how to make the most of their militaries. The outcomes of this research will inform the answer to this question. More specifically, we aim to provide a guide to policy-makers on how to maximise their military forces during times of financial and geo-political flux. For this, we have engaged users from the MoD, Chatham House and the Royal United Services Institute in the design of this research. We also have designed the project management board to bring users into the operation and outcomes of the project.

We seek to impact defence forces in Europe as well through dissemination and communication at the national levels and through collaboration with unique units such as the British Army's Land Warfare Centre in Warminster. We also seek to involve other specialised units during the course of research, particularly in France where the adoption of the C4ISR (Command, Control, Communication, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance) concept has also been a significant strategic change.

Finally, the project engages with the defence industry, especially in the area of C4ISR technologies. In doing so, we add value to how defence ministries, their technology arms (e.g. DSTL) and the defence industry itself, including BAE systems and DefenceIQ, drive the development of military strategy.

Overall, the project aims to inform decision making and policy, in addition to its academic goals of uncovering the causal effects of strategic change in contemporary European forces.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>209884</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Paper given at UACES Conference 2014: The Drivers of Contemporary Strategic Reform in Europe: planning for beyond the financial crisis?</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D336D5C5-156A-46A2-B7A9-46400A6A0F8E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The paper was presented as past of the UACES annual conference.

The work on military innovation continues to be an area in which the PI (Galbreath) contributes to. This work has informed Prof Galbreath's contributions at the Ministry of Defence (Main building), British Army (1st Battalion, MoD St Athan), Oxford's Centre for the Changing Character of War Programme, Centre for Historical Analysis and Conflict Research at Sandhurst, the Joint Services Command and Staff College at Shrivingham, the Royal College of Defence Studies in London, workshops by DSTL on Quantum Technologies (at Oxford), on Additive Manufacturing (Swindon), on decision-making and uncertainty (London) as well as Cabinet Office groups on drones and AI. Finally, Galbreath participated in the Cabinet Office's SDSR working group for the 2015 Strategic Defence and Security Review.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>E9970012-9086-4BAE-AA42-DCAF3AA6720B</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56af55371d0395.89237192</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The goal of the fist year has been to interview defence planners and tactical decision-makers in European militaries and defence establishments. So far, we have interviewed nearly 100 individuals looking at changes in European militaries. Our questions have worked along the four drivers we highlight in the grant proposal which are budgets, geopolitics, combat experience and tactical reform.

The second year was used to begin writeup and dissemination of the work. 

In the paper published in Defence Studies in 2014, we found that, 'This article looks at the changing nature of European militaries specifically within the context of the United States's transformation agenda. The article looks at the key drivers of transformation in European militaries and asks the question to what degree has the American agenda impacted on the way Europe does defence. The article looks at three aspects of transformation across three case studies. The aspects are network enabledness, expeditionary forces and effects based operations. The analysis is applied to the United Kingdom, France and Germany. The findings suggest that local political and bureaucratic conditions have the potential to trump a larger process of force transformation led by the United States.'

In a book chapter, I argued 'This chapter seeks to address the central question in three ways. The first section examines the nature of military modernization in Europe. If the Europeans have not done a RMA at home, how then have they changed? I look specifically how this is linked to RMA innovations in strategy and operations. Secondly, I look at ways to understand the US-European relationship around RMA, paying particular attention to learning and norm transfer. Finally, I look at how the Europeans have sought to understand RMA as an American form of modernization and in relation to their own militaries. I pay special attention to the way European defence decision-makers see the US and its war machine in relation to modernization. The chapter teases out the factors that limit military modernization in Europe.'

In our contribution to a book on the EU and European Defence, Simon Smith and I argued that 'We suggest that while the EU has an important role to play in providing a framework for technical and procurement cooperation, it is unable to engage with some of the more pressing questions about what European militaries are for and how they should go about defending and securing Europe. Secondly, in analysing the extent to which the EU has been able to overcome barriers to strategic thinking in this area we examine the ways in which the EU has sought to modernise Europe's militaries and identify the points of decision-making that empower and constrain strategic thinking. In the final section, we seek to answer two questions: To what extent do competing strategies from the different actors enable or constrain strategic developments? And are there any other impeding factors to a more cohesive strategy? We illustrate how despite there being a common view on security and defence, there are distinct differences on how this will be resourced and on what role key allies like the United States play in determining the use of European militaries going forward. Together, these questions allow us to engage with the larger relationship between the EU and Europe's militaries.'

In a current book project, Simon Smith and I are using a comparative methodology to compare the 8 countries and how innovation is shaping their militaries.
