&lt;p>This project implements a multi-media, multi-agency dissemination and utilisation strategy developed from the findings of the ESRC/DFID research project: Shame, Poverty and Social Exclusion: A comparative analysis in seven countries. The study found that people in poverty often experience shame because they cannot afford fully to participate in society and because they are shamed by public agencies and by language used by politicians and the media. Poverty-related shame limits individual agency and may therefore help perpetuate poverty.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In the context of global discussions about renewal of the Millennium Development Goals, the project aims to inform public, media and policy debates around poverty. A core component of the project is a web-based resource designed to sensitise policy makers, practitioners and the wider public to the psychosocial consequences of poverty.&amp;nbsp; Partnerships with ATD-Fourth World, Mediae, the Media Trust and Pegasus Theatre will generate new, engaging and thought provoking content for wide dissemination, while parallel policy work will seek to establish and promote principles and a template to ensure that social protection and welfare policies promote rather than undermine human dignity and agency.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The overall goal is to help increase the effectiveness of public services and policies and enhance quality of life, health and creative output of people living in poverty. The potential impact is instrumental (influencing anti-poverty policy and practice as well as altering wider societal responses to poverty and those experiencing it); conceptual (through the focus on reframing poverty discourses around the social dynamics of poverty); and capacity building (sensitising policy makers and those working at the point of delivery to the complexities of the poverty-shame dynamic and offering knowledge and resources to encourage reflective policy formulation and implementation). 

The beneficiaries of the research include those currently living in poverty. Through direct involvement in the development of the 'Shame-Proofing Toolkit' they will have opportunities to shape the nature of the debate and incorporate their ideas and priorities for improving the design and delivery of poverty alleviation strategies. Their ideas will also be incorporated into the popular media portfolio (soap operas and short films, theatre in education) and hence stand to potentially influence the views of millions of members of the global public. 

Given the importance of public opinion in shaping the nature of the debate surrounding poverty policies, the 'Shame-Proofing Toolkit', through its use of popular media, stands to have a substantial reach. Makutano Junction has a regular weekly audience of 6.5 million viewers in Kenya where it is produced, and several million additional viewers in Uganda and Tanzania. It is supplemented by an interactive mobile SMS/Text interface and website, allowing viewers to access aditional information and engage in further debate and discussion. An additional component of Makutano Junction provides educational resources for use in UK schools. Resources enable teachers and students to view extracts from the soap opera and help engage young people with global issues; discovering similarities, challenging stereotypes and raising awareness.

The short films produced by the Media Trust will be broadcast as a 25 minute programme on the Community Channel, reaching between 800,000 and one million viewers a week in the UK. The Community Channel and Media Trust websites will provide dedicated pages for the 'Shame-Proofing Toolkit' (with links to the main website) and will provide further opportunities to view the films (which will also be transmitted via You Tube). Both media organisations will provide access to distribution networks and appropriate marketing support for the materials. 

The Pegasus Youth Theatre 'Heap' project, will reach young people across the UK and the final outputs from the project, a stage play recorded and digitalised for wider distribution and curriculum materials for English and Drama, have potential for extensive reach in terms of influencing young people's attitudes on the social dynamics of poverty. 

The 'Shame-Proofing Toolkit' and website, is likely to take on a momentum of its own, linking organisations together (something that was initiated through the dissemination seminar in March 2012), and providing two-way channels of communication between representatives of different institutions with a shared interest in poverty issues and debates. 

In terms of documenting the process of dissemination and the innovations supported by the proposed project, this will be something taken on by the research team in collaboration with other partners.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100215</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Keynote address: 'Shame lies at the absolutist core of poverty': An important insight or a distraction?.

Mediae, a television production company, determined to include storylines in a soap opera aired in East Africa; Pegasus Theatre Company re-designed educational material accompanying a new production; and the Media Trust offered collaboratively to produce documentaries. The International Labour Organisation encouraged policy engagement resulting in a successful amendment to ILO Recommendation 202 on social protection, while the NGO, ATD Fourth World, invited involvement in drafting input to the UN's consultation on the Sustainable Development Goals.
Subsequently the Media Trust produced four shorts on Pakistan, South Korea, Uganda and the UK (available at http://povertyshamedignity.spi.ox.ac.uk/home.html and elsewhere) highlighting the psychological and social impact that public and policy discourse have on the lives of people living in poverty. Edited into a documentary 'Rich Man, Poor Man' narrated by Jon Snow, they were shown on UK TV Channel 63 and on YouTube. Recut, they featured as part of Oxford University's annual review audited as reaching 328,000 people with 53,800 separate viewings of the film. The Guardian and BBC Radio 4 ('Thinking Allowed') covered the research. 
Follow through with ATD Fourth World included a temporary exhibit at the Ashmolean Museum and presentations at the UN and World Bank. The latter presentation led to support for participative research on the multidimensionality of poverty and involvement, with the ILO, in new ESRC/DFID funded research to test the effectiveness of antipoverty policies designed to avoid shame being conducted in China, India and Uganda.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>27923632-6D87-4C0B-928C-509654F4953A</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5540fc32945983.03029630</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This was a Knowledge Exchange collaborative project for which the ESRC grant was match funded by a number of different organisations (detailed below) in order to achieve the listed outputs. The aim was to disseminate findings from the ESRC/DFID -funded research project: Poverty, Shame and Social Exclusion: A study in Seven Countries (RES-167-25-0557)
In the context of global discussions on the future of the Millennium Development Goals, the overall goal was to influence public, media and policy debates around poverty and to help improve the effectiveness of national and global policy by focussing attention on the benefits of promoting the dignity of people living in poverty. The final output of the work is an evolving 'Shame-Proofing Toolkit', a web-based resource designed to alert policy makers, practitioners and the public to the psychological and social impacts of poverty. More specifically, the following outputs have been produced:
Makutano Junction Soap Opera: We have worked with Mediae (an education for Development NGO) to incorporate story lines from the Poverty, Shame and Social Exclusion (ESRC/DFID - funded study) into four episodes of series 13 of the soap opera Makutano Junction, viewed by over six million people in East Africa. (http://www.makutanojunction.com/all-episodes). 
Media Trust: series of four short films. Together with the Media Trust we have produced a series of four short films on poverty and shame in Uganda, South Korea, Pakistan and the UK. The films were combined into a single film, ' Rich man, poor man' (presented by the broadcaster John Snow) and launched on the Community Channel with accompanying media coverage and have been publicly screened on a number of occasions (and are available to download via the project website). The films juxtapose the voices of people living in poverty with those who are wealthier. Those in poverty have a chance to account for their circumstances and how they are made to feel by others and society; those not in poverty reflect on their own situations and why they believe that other people are living in poverty. The films combined make a powerful case of how the shame and stigma of poverty emerges, how such shame is socially constructed and how people living in poverty are subjected to shaming by others. 
Pegasus Youth Theatre (NGO): A theatre in education project: The Heap Working in partnership with the Pegasus Youth Theatre we have been involved in supporting the design and production of a theatre in education programme based on the book 'The Heap' (about children's experiences of poverty and shame). A drama production was launched in March 2013 and toured to schools in the UK and internationally. Findings from the Poverty, Shame and Social Exclusion study were used to work with the young people during the development of the production and included in the curriculum materials produced for schools (http://www.pegasustheatre.org.uk/learning-resources/pegasus-youth-theatre-companies-resource-the-heap-and-a-forgotten-instant/
ATD Fourth World: Global dialogue on poverty: Over the past 18 months the PIs have participated in a series of national and international (including New York, Burkina Faso, Brussels and Paris), workshops and events with people living in extreme poverty convened by ATD Fourth World. Through these events, the findings from the study have been used to influence ideas and dialogue about policies and practice in relation to educational provision; social work practice; and social protection systems and structures. They have included representation of the project findings at high level dialogue meetings including the United Nations Commission for Social Development and The World Bank. In addition (PI)Walker spent his sabbatical (2014) in New York explicitly to support the policy work.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This Knowledge Exchange project was designed specifically for the 'user community' since it considered how best to disseminate ideas to non academic audiences. In the case of this work, the 'user community' has multiple components. In the first instance it includes those people living in poverty who are repeatedly and in multiple contexts made to feel inadequate and inferior because of their lack of material resources. Therefore by shifting the nature of the debate around poverty; by promoting the reconceptualisation of anti-poverty policies so that they are dignity enhancing; and by encouraging politicians, policy makers, the general public and the media ( the other 'user communities) to think about the impact of their words and actions on people living in poverty - the societal and economic impact on this 'user community' is significant. The materials developed in the project and the strong collaborative links made with other relevant work mean that we are in a position to make an increasingly strong case for the social and economic benefits of enhancing people's dignity in the context of poverty. By channelling these initiatives through the project website, we have laid the foundations to continue influencing the 'user communities' about the central importance of dignity into the future. The on-going research will continue to sustain and enhance the range of outward facing initiatives designed to influence public and political opinion about the psychological and social impacts of poverty (until now aspects of poverty which have been largely ignored).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C6101B20-CCAD-4BBD-99BE-084EB10981C2</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5540ff511480f3.97783305</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://povertyshamedignity.spi.ox.ac.uk/home.html</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C0B6AA02-8AC2-4856-8819-F2AB69037BEF</gtr:id><gtr:title>??????
