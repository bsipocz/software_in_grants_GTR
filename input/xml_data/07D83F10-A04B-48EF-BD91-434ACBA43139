Communucations technologies are effecting a fundamental alteration in how human experience is mediated, and devices based on the principle of Digital Signal Processing permit new forms of convergence and exchange between different expressive means, such as sound and image. \n\nMy interest lies in exploring how technology can extend the possibilities of opera, stimulating its historic ambition to create lyric relationships between the different expressive media of space and time, sound, image, singing and performance. \n\nThis raises a number of issues for my practice area as an opera director, scenic designer and author of multimedia works. \n\nDevices which translate sound into projected imagery in real-time, whereby a musician can direct visual outcome, or a visual artist shape music, have a clear potential for extending the intermedial relations of opera. New relationships between impulse and expression challenge hierarchical models of authority at work in traditional opera performance, since, in theory, the roles of conductor, singers, orchestra, scenic context etc can be reassigned across all participants. Other new media, eg the web, extend this challenge by allowing expressive exchange between different sites, performers or audiences, in contrast to opera's conventional time-space constituents eg proscenium arch, orchestra pit, a single audience point of view.\n\nThis tension between new technologies and the paradigms of traditional opera is my central concern.\n\nResearch will address 3 questions.\n\n1. How can new technologies allow the hierarchical media-relations of conventional opera to be re-configured to new expressive and communicative ends? \n\n2. How do new technologies allow the expressive and communicative energies of lyric theatre to be translated into new environments such as the web?\n\n3. How do new technologies allow new relations to be made between the conventional time-space constituents of lyric theatre?\n\nThese will be investigated, 1. through studio investigation using translation softwares such as MaxMsp/Jitter and Isadora, making audiovisual studies around material by three composers, chosen for their different historic relation to the media of opera; 2. through workshop development to public performance of three new lyric theatre works, testing potentials for new intermedial relations and remediation:\n\n1 Les Noces: a theatre-based work, taking Stravinsky's piece - an historic deconstruction of hierarchical relations - as a starting point for a series of 10 minute performed 'chapters', reconfiguring core lyric theatre elements: dancer, singer, pianist, conductor, scenic artist (eg a dancer conducting from the pit, a pianist enacting ritual movement) and technological interventions (eg digital translation devices producing sound from movement, intermedial combinations of new and old technologies,) and the merging of proscenium and preparation contexts.\n\n2 Opera for the small screen: explores how qualities of operatic singing and performance physicality can translate into a non-theatrical outcome, such as a gallery piece, web-site object, or broadcast TV, using Contact Improvisation dance, singers and familiar camcorder technology to generate performance readings of a Mozart opera quartet, depicting quarrelling emotional perspectives.\n\n3 The Lost Chord: aims to disrupt conventional time-space constituents of lyric theatre, opening them to relationships configured through new technology, decontextualising proscenium operatic elements and immersing them in other spatial contexts, with web-based remote communication and physical computing, built around a remediation of Sullivan's song The Lost Chord, a historic image of trancendental intermedial connection.\n\nResearch will be disseminated through academic contexts and public performance.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-12-09</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>253756</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This explored how 3d live performance is perceived when seen in 2d renderings.

The impact arises from a project commissioned by the BBC Proms for its John Cage centenary on August 17, 2012, with the involvement of Transport for London. The project had direct impact upon 600 members of the public who took part in a performance event around the Albert Hall using mobile media devices, and a further 5961 people who accessed the project website. The project also had impact upon the policy thinking of the BBC in relation to mobile media as transmission platforms, Transport for London in relation to its strategy for pedestrians, and new music promoter Sound and Music</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>B7D15732-08D6-4C53-953E-345C0A4BE6EF</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56dd903a699551.02271701</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The Fellowship aimed to support exploration of the potential and significance of new media technologies for opera and music theatre. At its conclusion in 2012, this work had significantly extended activity in an innovative field of research and practice, during an important period for the artform brought about by technological change. It enhanced the awardee's research, helped frame wider debates in the academic realm, and encouraged professional arts organisations to translate its concerns into commissioned projects. As a mark of this the University of Sussex have since appointed the awardee as Research Fellow in Experimental Music Theatre, and external organisations (Welsh National Opera, Sound and Music, BBC Proms, Scottish Opera, The Space, Opera Europa) have explored new platforms, under his guidance, in a variety of ways arising from the research.

At the outset of the award, three specific projects were conceived as focal points for objectives. Described in more detail elsewhere, these were:
1) Give me Your Blessing (2009, with The Royal Opera, Opera Genesis, composer Elena Langer and performers from The Pokrovsky Ensemble, Moscow) deployed combinations of live performance and digital media in a theatrical context, offering a deconstruction of Stravinsky's Les Noces that incorporated virtual platforms such as Second Life (partners Royal Opera House Two, Opera Genesis, composer Elena Langer and members of the Pokrovsky Ensemble, Moscow.) The project is documented in the book Mapping Intermediality in Performance (Amsterdam 2010). 2) Lost Chord (2010, with Opera North) investigated kinship between historic registers (the late Victorian creative imagination) and images of technological transformation, in an immersive music theatre piece. 3) Idomeneo TV (aka TV Opera, 2012, with Aldeburgh Music) explored how 3d live performance is perceived when seen in 2d renderings. This considered alternatives to dominant traditions of translating opera to the screen, by giving singers cameras and responsibility for image, towards a screen-based outcome which was a function of performance, rather than a report of one.

'Astonished and Terrified - Opera and the Transformation of the world by Technology', a conference marking the end of the Fellowship, took place at Sussex in 2012. This helped share discoveries with others engaged in opera's creative uses of media, either through interpretations of opera's existing repertoire or imagining new kinds of opera for the future. The event attracted national and international participants.

BBC Proms Music Walk 2012 (www.promsmusicwalk.com) is an example of a project arising from the research context once the award was underway. It responded to a development in technological paradigm - namely the accelerating use of mobile media devices from 2009 onwards. 
12 composers from a range of musical backgrounds were commissioned to write 10 short compositions inspired by locations around the Albert Hall and Exhibition Road (itself a C19th theme park for an idea that science, technology and art should speak to each other.) The composers represented a variety of approaches to contemporary musical composition, including the American experimental composer Alvin Curran, Scottish composer Judith Weir, electronic music duo Sound Intermedia and others. Their compositions were made freely available online to be heard on headphones via mobile technologies such as smartphones/Mp3 players at the locations themselves, or downloaded and listened to elsewhere. Audiences could also call a phone line to upload sounds of other locations, which were algorithmically organised into an extra piece. Transport for London produced a map locating the works according to composers names, alongside other amenities (such as bus stops or bike parks.) This placed headphone-wearing listeners at the center of new artistic experiences, triangulating perceptions of sites, sounds and audience connection and action. The creative use of such technologies foregrounded issues of live performance and embodiment, the social effects of digital portability, notions of public space as curated space, and opening the digital realm outwards to the 'real' world, with the potential to augment our experience of that world. As Creative Director, the awardee devised the project, introduced the collaboration between TfL and the Proms, curated the composer/location interaction, and directed a multi-location Prom event whereby audiences experienced recordings as part of happenings featuring the composers themselves. The impact of this project is outlined elsewhere.

Occupation (www.occupation.org.uk) commissioned by Welsh National Opera and the Space (2014,) is an instance of a post-award project developed using practical knowhow and reflection the Fellowship made possible. A platform for new composition with a strong social media dimension, Occupation ran alongside WNO's Liberty or Death Season (which presented 19th century works - William Tell, Carmen, Mose in Egitto.) It aimed to translate thematic concerns into the digital and contemporary realm - in a way which to allowed audiences for different kinds of music to bump into each other. It framed two key aspects of the digital realm in action: immediacy and cultural reach - for example how the spread of consciousness about political events seemed to be accelerated by social media. Five composers were invited to write new songs responding to current events, of their choosing, within a particular two-week time frame - songs as a form of news. Carleen Anderson wrote about Ferguson, Missouri; Judith Weir about the Hong Kong democracy occupations; Cerys Matthews about injustice in the US; High Contrast about Christmas consumerist excess; Dan-Wyn Jones created lyrics for a song using comments submitted online by the public. As it had to respond to the flow of events, the creative cycle was highly condensed - songs conceived one week, written the next, recorded, filmed and uploaded to the project website the week after.

Viewed as a whole, this award has helped make space to consider what new questions technology might allow opera to ask, and what kind of audiences opera might now reach. It has helped to facilitate debate and action, and to propose that Opera is well-placed to set the pace of formal adventure, both as a 400 year history of technological innovation, and as a model of creative thinking, already familiar with ways of converging different modes of expression into alternative realities in imaginative ways. It has also allowed the opera-media relationship to be articulated from another angle - how opera in particular may explore artistically the transformation of the world by technology, from critical as well as utopian perspectives, as society and individuals process how they are viewed by the digital realm, and what this means. 

In terms of projects as conceived at the outset, some key objectives have arguably been met. However, longer-term ambitions which the award has awoken, for example the
creation of curatorial units related to this area inside opera companies, and their further partnerships with HE organisations, are of course still very much work-in-progress, dependent on how wider frameworks of cultural provision are organised and prioritised.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>See above</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>EA8D53CC-108A-4A33-B616-1D31A48966E3</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56df09fbd50b36.91739485</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/E005969/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>0AEFDABE-67A4-48B1-9DB4-99393BDE6065</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Music</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>55773495-BB0B-43EB-B99D-D5C15272A52F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Musical Performance</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
