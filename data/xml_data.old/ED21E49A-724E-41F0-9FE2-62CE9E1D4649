The daily light-dark cycle provides the predominant time-cue that they use and organisms as varied as flies and mice have evolved mechanisms to synchronize their behaviour to both daily and seasonal time. In flies and mice, there are specialized groups of cells in the brain that contain 'oscillators' and these oscillators inform the cells when to signal the animal to be awake or asleep. This oscillator mechanism also functions in other cells of the body (e.g. eyes, heart and lung) and is important for regulating the time-of-day that cells perform local physiological events relevant to that particular organ. Over the past decade we have learnt a lot about how this oscillator mechanism works. Two key factors, which in the fly are called CLOCK (CLK) and CYCLE (CYC), have to be expressed in a cell for it to become an oscillator. Together, CLK and CYC proteins bind to other genes and activate their transcription. The proteins produced as a result, are able to block the activity of CLK-CYC. They therefore 'feed-back' to inhibit CLK-CYC and, hence, stall their own production. The combined effect these proteins have on each other ensures that the feed-back process/loop takes approximately 24 hours and therefore, the level of any one component peaks at a particular time of day (e.g. late evening) every day. In addition to regulating the feedback-loop, these factors also activate 'output' genes and it is the rhythmic regulation of these genes that command the cell to carry out certain functions at a particular time-of-day (e.g. late evening - go to sleep!). We therefore have a good understanding of how these oscillator cells maintain their daily rhythms. However, for this oscillator mechanism to operate, CLK and CYC must first be present together within a cell to start the ball rolling and get the oscillator ticking. My current research is aimed at trying to identify the factors that activate the Clk and cyc genes within a cell. To study this, I have chosen the fly eye as a model oscillator system because the eyes are easily accessible, they contain functional oscillators and the genes that shape their development are known. TWIN-OF-EYELESS (TOY) and EYELESS (EY) are critical factors controlling eye development. Animals unable to make either of these proteins develop with severely reduced eyes. I have recently found that TOY and EY are able to bind the Clk gene. This raises the exciting possibility that TOY and EY may provide the initial activation of Clk at the time the oscillator starts ticking in the photoreceptor cells. Importantly, in the context of the whole animal TOY and EY are not the only activators of Clk because other cell-types do not express TOY or EY but have oscillators. TOY and EY belong to a larger group of proteins called the Paired-homeobox (Pax) family, some of whose members regulate genes by binding similar DNA sequences to TOY and EY. Importantly, these other members (e.g. POX NEURO; POXN) are present in other oscillator-cell-types, so it is possible that different Pax proteins may activate Clk to start the oscillator mechanism in these other cell-types. The main aim of this proposal is to investigate the exciting link between Pax genes and the oscillator mechanism. This will be achieved by first showing if TOY and EY activate the Clk gene in the eye at the time the oscillator mechanism starts to tick. It will then be determined if POXN can activate Clk in oscillator cells of the fly legs and wings. This will provide good evidence that the Pax family, through their activation of Clk, are key determinants of oscillator cells.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>I have recently discovered that in Drosophila the core circadian oscillator gene Clock (Clk) has within its promoter binding-sites for a transcription factor critical during eye development. Preliminary in vivo analysis has shown CLK protein to be expressed in a spatio-temporal pattern consistent with that of a known target of this factor, suggesting it activates Clk during development. This proposal will use combined in vitro (cell-culture) and in vivo (Gal4-UAS) reporter gene analysis to determine whether this factor activates the Clk gene during development and, at later times (late pupa) when the oscillator mechanism starts to function. This will identify novel binding sites in the Clk promoter and lead to a better understanding of how this core oscillator gene is regulated in photoreceptors. Using UAS-Gal4 (sustainer) technology, this factor will be over-expressed in the eyes of adults so the effect on Clk transcription can be assessed by the perturbation of the normal mRNA rhythm at this time. This approach will provide important insight in to the function of this factor and will compliment the in vivo reporter gene results. Further, it will validate the use of a novel application to over-express potent transcription factors in the eyes of otherwise normally-developed adults. This will overcome previous technical limitations and has the potential to provide a powerful tool for eye developmental research.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-01-06</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-12-07</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>308139</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The main finding is that the master regulator of eye development (TOY/Pax6) also starts the biological clock in central neurons in the brain that are the master control for timing daily sleep-wake cycles.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>These findings should translate to mammalian clock cells and therefore have potential for future progress in human stem cell research.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5E359B02-A5D7-473B-BED5-28C6DF9C51B4</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5463a8b669a565.31186360</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AEF6A702-ECB1-4644-9F60-6592393DADC5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Effects of TWIN-OF-EYELESS on Clock Gene Expression and Central-Pacemaker Neuron Development in Drosophila.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of biological rhythms</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4e305bc2cc24d894b1bfaf3dcbd66fab"><gtr:id>4e305bc2cc24d894b1bfaf3dcbd66fab</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Glossop NR</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0748-7304</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>546247c21c8466.33532160</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1503BEFA-E1A9-4177-B408-F7F500F5B49D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Analysis of the Drosophila Clock promoter reveals heterogeneity in expression between subgroups of central oscillator cells and identifies a novel enhancer region.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of biological rhythms</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/dd8b15a3a761981f5afc406fb00e2f96"><gtr:id>dd8b15a3a761981f5afc406fb00e2f96</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gummadova JO</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0748-7304</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>54624771e0acd0.55627927</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/D016339/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
