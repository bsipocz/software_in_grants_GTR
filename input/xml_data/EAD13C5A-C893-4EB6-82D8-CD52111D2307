Recent studies of sediment cores from the East China Sea suggest that a similar pattern of ocean current and climate variability is visible in the western Pacific. However, the existence of parallel Pacific-Atlantic climatic events over the last 10,000 years requires more rigorous and wider testing, in particular using equivalent well-dated records of climate change in both regions. This proposal aims to establish a record of past climate change from raised peat bogs on Hokkaido Island, northern Japan, to complement the many European and Canadian peat-based records of past climate change, so enabling a comparison of the records between the two ocean basins. The new Hokkaido records will be the first of their kind in Japan, therefore this proposal will act as a proof-of-concept for the use of Japanese raised bogs in research into past climate change, using watertable reconstruction. By comparing Japanese raised bog climate records with equivalent European and North American records a fair and relatively straightforward comparison of the differences and similarities between the past climates of the North Atlantic and western Pacific can be achieved since all of the records will be responding to similar climatic parameters. This proposal aims to test the hypotheses that (1) the climate of northern Japan has a cyclic behaviour including a millennial pacing immediately driven by changes in the East Asian Monsoon and/or the strength of the Kuroshio Current and that (2) the timings of millennial-scale events are synchronous with those recorded in the North Atlantic region. Raised bogs are already well known sources of records for past climatic change in Europe. Pioneering research in Britain and Denmark has demonstrated that there is a close link between bog watertable levels and changes in air temperature/precipitation. This link exists because raised bogs are gently domed so that the plants living on them receive all of their water and nutrients from the atmosphere. As soon as the balance between rainfall and evaporation changes this shift is reflected in the bog water level. Records of past watertable positions and therefore climate change are preserved in peat bogs because they continuously accumulate peat over time. The peat is composed of the dead remains of plants and animals that once inhabited the bog surface. As climate and the bog watertables change through time the composition of the plant and animal communities living on the bog will shift to reflect the prevailing bog surface wetness and this in turn determines the type of peat that is deposited. Past watertable levels are reconstructed by studying (1) the plant and (2) animal remains in peat as well as (3) the level of breakdown of the peat. The proposed project will employ all three measures of bog surface wetness. The measures will be combined to produce a single, high resolution reconstruction of change in the water balance over the last 7000 years. The project demands a high standard of dating control to enable meaningful comparisons with events from other regions; therefore the project will use both AMS radiocarbon dating and the analysis of volcanic ash layers to construct an age-depth model for the study site. Japan is an active volcanic region and numerous ash layers exist in bogs, lakes and ocean sediments across the region. These ash layers have been geochemically characterised and dated to a high standard by Japanese researchers in recent years. The raised bog moisture balance record will be compared to existing local and regional palaeoclimate records (e.g. lake-level data, loess sequences from China, and speleothems) before comparisons are made with European and North American raised bog records and other 'Atlantic' archives of past climatic change such as the Greenland ice cores.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>58740</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The impact of high tephra loading on late-Holocene carbon accumulation and vegetation succession in Japanese peatland communities.</gtr:description><gtr:form>Scientific meeting (conference/symposium etc.)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B8D935CE-77F1-4A6A-BEF7-B40BAC5CD948</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited lecture at the Quaternary Research Association Annual Discussion Meeting, January 2012.

Plant macrofossil and testate amoebae records are presented alongside records of total organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous. Age-depth models are developed using a Bayesian approach with seven AMS radiocarbon dates and three identified historical tephras from Baitoushan (AD 969), and Hokkaido-Komagatake (AD 1640 and AD 1694) volcanoes. Results show that moderate to high tephra loading can shift peatland plant communities from Sphagnum to monocotyledon domination. This vegetation change is associated with increased peat humification and reduced carbon accumulation. Where tephra deposition and reworking has occurred, the apparent rate of carbon accumulation can be halved while high rates of tephra delivery to the mire surface are sustained. Sphagnum species vary in their tolerance to tephra deposition. After each ash fall S. magellanicum disappeared from the plant macrofossil record, whereas Sphagnum papillosum showed apparent continuity of development through the AD1694 Ko-c2 tephra. High rates of carbon accumulation, 2- 3 times faster than the average for northern peatlands, were recorded in the Sphagnum communities that established after the cessation of tephra deposition and reworking from the AD 969 Baitoushan ash fall (B-Tm tephra). This peak in carbon accumulation was coincident with a radical shift in mire nutrient cycling, most probably caused by the interaction of Sphagnum magellanicum with leachates from the underlying tephras. The phase of high carbon accumulation continued for over 300 years, offsetting the initial negative impact of the B-Tm tephra on peatland C accumulation within 100 years of Sphagnum re-establishment. These results suggest that management for ash-tolerant Sphagnum species could be a highly effective strategy for minimising volcanic disruption to peatland carbon accumulation. The study also shows that consideration of volcanic impacts on peatlands is essential for development of more realistic terrestrial carbon balance models in volcanically active regions.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Peatlands are major stores of terrestrial carbon. Appropriate management of peatlands will become an increasingly important method of off-setting carbon emissions under international carbon credit trading systems. The findings presented here represent vital background research that can be used to inform management strategies for peatlands included in carbon offsetting agreements.



This research can be used to inform conservation biodiversity action plans for peatland habitats at risk from volcanic impacts. The research reported here can be used to model the carbon balance of peatlands subject to volcanic ash loading.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0DE441F3-6206-4580-A748-9DB2AF0D37F0</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-1916372535.67238577759b44e</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>78C39201-2293-482E-A428-117310D7CA4A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Climate drivers for peatland palaeoclimate records</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Quaternary Science Reviews</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2b4f4b460f75152add42801cf83bd100"><gtr:id>2b4f4b460f75152add42801cf83bd100</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Charman D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d0070077d2286d</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>038CC70B-32FA-4E8A-BD9D-CC34B6469FCF</gtr:id><gtr:title>The impact of high tephra loading on late-Holocene carbon accumulation and vegetation succession in peatland communities</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Quaternary Science Reviews</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a219b8b0136af9c7533d6b273bf4319a"><gtr:id>a219b8b0136af9c7533d6b273bf4319a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hughes P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d0080081f30854</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B285D469-12C5-4320-A781-8826A21BF418</gtr:id><gtr:title>The methodological basis for fine-resolution, multi-proxy reconstructions of ombrotrophic peat bog surface wetness</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Boreas</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7c8edf1b184df152738ed88adfe67264"><gtr:id>7c8edf1b184df152738ed88adfe67264</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>AMESBURY M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d06906920b4d15</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/D006899/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E4C03353-6311-43F9-9204-CFC2536D2017</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Atmospheric phys. &amp; chemistry</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>70</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Climate &amp; Climate Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6E910789-6B8D-4B73-B5B0-F3156942B558</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Geosciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>70</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Climate &amp; Climate Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E94BED75-343A-47C8-BEA1-E1E927732B34</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Land - Atmosphere Interactions</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7DCAF586-72E2-4881-9251-E72F38AF1CA4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Palaeoenvironments</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
