 &lt;li>to understand how teachers? practices influence students? metalinguistic learning.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>The study will follow two cohorts of students in primary and secondary for three years, tracking the development of their metalinguistic understanding and their development in writing.

&lt;p>&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The study's focus on metalinguistic understanding and its relationship to writing development will have important implications not only for academic beneficiaries, but also for policy-makers and for professional practice. These implications would not be limited to England and Australia only, but would have relevance to the many Anglophone countries for whom the place of grammar in the curriculum remains contested (eg Canada; USA; New Zealand; South Africa). Arguably, the Australian National Curriculum, with its goal to achieve a 'gradually more powerful conversion of 'knowledge about' language into a resource for effective reading, listening, viewing, writing, speaking and designing' (ACARA 2009:3), is underpinned by a more coherent rationale than its English counterpart. However, this rationale is not as yet empirically tested, a gap which this study will address in relation to writing. At the same time, the study's investigation of how metalinguistic understanding is realised in writing attainment is important given international concerns about achievement in writing and the social wellbeing and economic implications that derive from being an effective communicator in writing.

This study's results, therefore, will have the potential to inform evidence-based national policy-making in language education, curriculum design, examination and testing procedures, teacher education, and to inform practitioners and professional practice. The participatory and collaborative nature of the research design will also bring benefits to the teachers and students directly involved in the study, potentially transforming departmental cultures and practices.
 
Potential beneficiaries of this research in England and the nature of the potential impact are outlined below:

1. The project schools, both the participating teachers and students in the sample classes.
Involvement in the research is likely to benefit participating teachers in developing their pedagogic subject knowledge of metalinguistic understanding in the context of writing, and will benefit students in helping them to reflect on and articulate their metalinguistic understanding.

2. Policy-makers and policy-informers, such as the Department for Education, Ofsted, and government ministers.
The findings of the study are likely to benefit policy-makers by providing an evidence-based understanding of the relationship between metalinguistic understanding and writing development which should help to provide a coherent theoretical and pedagogical rationale for curriculum development.

3. Testing and Assessment bodies, such as Cambridge Assessment, OCR, Edexcel, and AQA.
The findings related to developmental aspects of metalinguistic understanding and how it manifests itself in writing are likely to benefit test developers in terms of both test design and marker training.

4. Professional Associations, such as the National Association of Advisors in English, the National Association for the Teaching of English, and the United Kingdom Literacy Association.
The findings are likely to benefit professional associations by providing evidence-based understanding to inform school-facing guidance and support materials and in shaping subject-specific responses to policy-makers and policy consultations.

5. School teachers and school leaders.
The teaching materials developed for the study and the pedagogical implications of the findings are likely to benefit English teachers and literacy co-ordinators, particularly with reference to teaching strategies which support the development of metalinguistic understanding.

6. Student teachers, and lecturers in HEI responsible for Primary and Secondary English.
The empirical results and teaching materials are likely to benefit pre-service students and course tutors, particularly in highlighting what linguistic subject knowledge and pedagogic practices supports effective teaching of metalinguistic understanding.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>370343</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>172163</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Grammar for Writing Primary</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Education Endowment Foundation</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>598DE0C8-EF9A-4060-9960-E5419CEF2365</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d53b5eeb4069.61758290</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-02-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>They have been used to develop CPD training for teachers, to write a book for teachers to help develop their grammatical subject knowledge, and they have been used for others in developing teaching materials for primary grammar.

WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN METALINGUISTIC KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING, AND DEVELOPMENT IN WRITING?

1 The nature of cumulative metalinguistic learning about writing between 9 and 14.
How does grammar knowledge develop?
? Students' grammatical knowledge is heavily dependent on what is taught because it is explicit knowledge
? Classroom definitions and explanations often hinder conceptual development of grammatical understanding, because they rely on proxy semantic definitions
? There is strong evidence of students' grammatical reasoning and use of logic independent of teachers
? At the same time, students often repeat or articulate a standard definition of a grammatical term but don't use that definition actively as a test in the examples offered
? Conceptual development of abstract grammatical terminology is not strictly linear- prototypical understanding moving to wider interconnected understanding, like ripples in a pond 
? Longitudinal data reveals how appropriate teacher interventions could alter their conceptual understanding

2 The metalinguistic understanding learners demonstrate in talking about their writing following explicit teaching about grammar for writing
How do young writers talk about their grammar choices?
? Students are now more confident in identifying grammar structures because of its new emphasis in the curriculum
? There is a tendency to talk about 'deploying', about 'putting things in', which is heavily influenced by the curricular context, especially the key stage 2 Teacher Assessment requirements
? Students find it more challenging to verbalise the relationship between a grammar choice and its effect in their writing 
? There is a relationship between how teachers manage classroom talk and how students verbalise their understanding of their grammatical choices and their effects in writing
? Methodology: the study has highlighted the value of the 'writing conversation'; and also the use of sample sentences as an elicitation tool to stimulate talk which illustrates metalinguistic understanding

3 The relationship between learners' metalinguistic talk (analysis of knowledge) and their application of knowledge (control of processes) in their writing?
 What is the relationship between what they know and what they do?
? There was evidence that some students are able to use a (taught) structure before they can name that structure and its effect explicitly
? Some students are able to articulate explicitly their use of grammatical structure but without using grammatical metalanguage
? Relatively few students verbalise confidently the grammar choices and its effect in writing
? This raises a further important question about much of this is developmental and how much is linked to the students' pedagogical experiences

4 The relationship between teachers' practices and students' metalinguistic learning.
What is the role of classroom practices in shaping this development?
? There is a very strong relationship between what is taught and what is learned which has both positive and negative outcomes
? How teachers model writing through joint or shared composition can influence student learning, particularly in terms f creating independence and verbalisable metalinguistic understanding
? How teachers use mentor texts can support metalinguistic learning about writing or can reduce students to very basic imitative writing
? How teachers teach the grammatical concepts has a very significant influence on students' conceptual understanding of grammatical terms.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>There are
