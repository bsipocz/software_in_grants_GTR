However, concern for global forest ecosystems has been growing over recent decades because of the uncertainty related to how they will respond to the anticipated changes in climate. Tropical forests are critical to the functioning of planet Earth in terms of biodiversity, resource management and carbon storage. The complexity of tropical ecosystems means that their likely response to predicted future climate change is highly uncertain. The FORSENS project is aimed to improve the understanding of tropical forest dynamics. The research project is based on a comparison of forests dynamics through time (Last Glacial Maximum [c. 21,500 years ago] to the present) across an elevation and latitudinal gradient. The FORSENS project will examine biological remains contained within sediments cores from lakes to reconstruct past environmental change. 

The FORSENS project will develop two entirely new records of past environmental change (one from the Andean highlands and one from lower elevation on the eastern Andean flank) within the equatorial tropics. The two new sites are: 1) Lake Ba&amp;ntilde;os (Ecuador, 00o19.320'N-78o9.184'W, 3816 m asl) and, 2) A new record to be collected from W Amazonia lowlands (Colombia, Ecuador). In addition, two published records of past environmental change from the southern hemisphere tropics will be enhanced to create a network of four comparable sites across which past environmental changes can be assessed. The two enhanced sites are: 1) Lake Khomer Kotcha (Bolivia, 17o16.154'S-65o43.945'W, 4153 m asl[1] and, 2) Lake Consuelo (Peru, 13o57'S-68o59'W, 1360 m asl [2]).

The examination of multiple proxies will allow different drivers of environmental change to be revealed. Key techniques applied will be fossil pollen (vegetation change), charcoal (fire history), non-biting midges (temperature and/or water quality), non-polle palynomorphs (NPP; human impact) and biomarkers (plant community change). In addition, the non-biological composition will also be considered to provide insight into the depositional environment (loss-on-ignition, magnetic susceptibility, colour). Key indicators for human (crop pollen, charcoal or dung fungus) or climate (non-biting midges) drivers of change will be examined at each study site.

The knowledge of past interactions between climate-vegetation-human will provide new insight into how future global climatic change could affect to tropical forests. To allow a comparable data set to be generated from all the records specific time intervals of known past climate change will be targeted: 1) the last deglaciation (21,500-11,700 years ago) and, 2) the Holocene Dry event (8,000-4,000 years ago). These time intervals have been characterised by the occurrence of rapid climatic shifts (e.g., an average warming around 4oC/century during the end of deglaciation) equivalent to those proposed for the near future. The analyses of the different biological proxies will allow possible future vegetation responses to predicted climatic changes to be anticipated. 

The research will be carried out by Dr Montoya assisted by expertise and facilities within the Centre for Earth, Planetary, Space and Astronomical Research (CEPSAR) at The Open University (OU). Specifically the project will be hosted within the Palaeoenvironmental Change Research Laboratory (PCR) lead by Dr Gosling. Montoya will bring new skills related to NPP to The OU and will undertake training in the areas of non-biting midges and biomarkers. The FORSENS project will bring together the two currently unconnected professional networks of Montoya and Gosling to create a truly global network of specialists

The outputs from the FORSENS project will be of wide interest and benefit within and beyond the academic community, provide relevant information for policy makers and conservationists as well as hopefully engaging general public. The new insights into interactions between climate, forests and climate revealed by the FORSENS research has the potential to generate a narrative which could capture the imagination of the general public; following, for example &amp;quot;Dung loaming: how llamas aided the Inca empire&amp;quot; The Guardian (22 May 2011).

How will they benefit?
The insights which will be gained from the FORSENS project will be relevant to bodies, such as local government agencies and Non-Governmental Organisations, who are responsible for managing and conserving the economic and environmental resources at a landscape level, e.g. for ecotourism, timber extraction, food and house resources for indigenous cultures. In addition, the geographic scale at which the FORSENS project is operating means that findings will be relevant to understanding environmental change on an international scale, i.e. climate teleconnections and characterization of forest response to climate/human pressures.

What will be done to ensure they benefit?
Transferring core academic knowledge related to drivers of environmental change into policy and conservation at a national and/or international level is challenging. 
 - At a national scale the FORSENS partners already have contacts within research institutions based in the countries from which the cores will be recovered: (i) Universidad San Simon (Cochabamba, Bolivia), (ii) Instituto Geofisico (Quito, Ecuador), (iii) Universidad San Antonio (Cusco, Peru), and (iv) Universidad de los Andes (Colombia). Links to these organisations will provide a route to local organisations and agencies directly involved with management and conservation at a landscape scale, e.g. Asociaci&amp;oacute;n Ecosistemas Andinos. Summary findings of key aspects of the FRSENS project will be published in regional journals in the Spanish language will ensure that outputs have an impact in the communities of the study region. 
 - At an international scale it is anticipated that the main engagement will be via peer-reviewed publications, presentations at international conferences and invited lectures at universities world-wide. Peer-reviewed publications will be registered on the Open University's open access institutional repository - Open Research Online (ORO) at http://oro.open.ac.uk. This facility, launched in 2006, enables free access to research outputs via common search engines. Project results will be presented at large international conferences such as AGU and EGU, and smaller national conferences.

The research will be used to engage the public with science in a number of ways, including schools outreach, involvement with science festivals and the preparation of articles for magazines and newspapers. The Science Faculty at The OU has a strong commitment to outreach and is a world leader in converting research into distance learning education material, e.g. free to access course material http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/. In addition, information will be disseminated less formally through podcasts and videos hosted by the publically accessible ItunesU, where The OU has a strong presence http://open.edu/itunes/. To facilitate all engagement with the press and general public, the Fellow (Montoya) will attend the NERC Communicating Science course.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-10-11</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-12</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>293002</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Quaternary Research Assotiation workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8C539599-6DC9-47F8-803F-57549CDA4060</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The research group made a poster about the challenges of palaeoecology

Research: 
1) Through the comparison of several locations, we have studied how different communities (including terrestrial and aquatics) have responded in the recent past (last millennia) to natural hazards such as volcanic activity, and how the forest can act as a natural barrier for preserving the water quality and therefore, the aquatic communities' characteristics. This is crucial as one of the lake studied is located within a National Park responsible for water supply to a population of around 2 million people (Quito and surroundings).

2) The discovery of one sedimentary sequence of about 50 thousands years old with huge changes in the sedimentation rate has highlighted: 
a) Severe climatic changes as the Last Glacial Maximum (in currently warm and wet locations) were not strong enough to allow a drastic vegetation replacement from forest to a more (open) savannah landscape; 
b) Pre-montane tropical forest of the location studied has showed different rates of sensitivity and dynamism during the last 50 thousand years, with maximum stability presented during full glacial conditions
c) Climatic events likely related to precipitation changes (Late Glacial, Holocene Dry Event) probably influenced the vegetation of the location with an increase in open vegetation taxa and lianas and vines within the closed-canopy tropical forest 
d) During the last millennia, tropical forests of western northern South America are characterized by a high internal dynamism, with mayor taxa replacement within the forest structure taking place in around 200 years in average
e) Despite changes in composition and specific abundances of taxa, the forest has been characterised for novel assemblages through the last 50 thousand years, but always within a pre-montane tropical forest matrix, dominated (in the palynological asemblage) for Melastomataceae taxa.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>By other researchers: this new fossil pollen sequence of a mid elevation tropical lake will be invaluable for next research in order to understand internal dynamism of tropical forests and natural dynamics and baselines of tropical forests before and after human arrival to the continent.

By managers and stakeholders: by preserving forest coverage, water quality chemical treatments could be reduced.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>964AAAAF-489F-4AB3-959E-D6162BFA0595</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544a17ae9545e2.13288410</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and
