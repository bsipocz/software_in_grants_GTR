the spatial legacy of The Troubles in inner-city Belfast, 1969-1994.</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/J011878/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The Troubles describes the social-historical phenomenon occurring between 1969 and 1994 when the sectarian conflict in Northern Ireland was at its most extreme. Those 25 years have had a profound impact on the social, political, economic, cultural and spatial structures of Northern Ireland ever since. The consequent reaction by government, security and statutory authorities bore witness to a profound material impact upon inner-city communities resulting in architectural and spatial disconnection and disengagement with the economic and social structures that manage, govern and regulate the built environment. 

This review focuses on a specific aspect of material impact, the built structures installed within the inner-city to divide streets, disconnect spatial continuity, mitigate against vehicular flow and limit pedestrian movement. These vary in implementation and include walls, bollards, landscaping and the locating of housing across the path of existing streets. This material impact is extensive across inner-city Belfast. Whilst the sociological and economic impact of The Troubles has received much research attention the impact of these built interventions has yet to be systematically assessed. This review recognises the inner-city exemplar of Ballymacarrett, East Belfast as a community of disconnected people and disconnected spaces. The considered implementation of these divisive built structures has served to fundamentally fragment and spatially disconnect this community. This review conceives of a community as an intrinsic ecosystem of people and the built environment and addresses the challenging issue of engaging a disenfranchised and disconnected community with a broad range of stakeholders and academic research. The review process is a catalyst for inclusive discussion that involves a team of project partner stakeholders, directly linking the review process with the agencies with the remit and funding to implement urban regeneration and social housing policy review and change.

The aims of this review are to utilise knowledge gained from academic and practice-based research methods to inform and stimulate discussion amongst key stakeholders with active inclusion from policy makers and the community. Such discussion has the stated aim of developing a policy discussion mechanism that will continue to progress the issues highlighted by the review beyond the review period. These aims meet address the objective of engaging research with non-academic stakeholders; empowering the related community; developing a methodological framework that is transferable to other contexts.

The creation of buildings and spaces is a complex scenario involving stakeholders across the social, political and economic spectrum. As a consequence built artefacts contain much embedded information pertaining to a wide variety of perspectives that concern, and have potential to engage, the community within which they are installed. The research team of an architect and a fine art photographer presents a cross disciplinary approach to analysing this context. The disciplines have been aligned to provide a historical record that is accessible to a diverse audience of community, policy, politics and academia. Architectural and spatial analysis will identify Case Studies of built structures that will be documented and illustrated through conceptual photographic representation. Built structures will be utilised as mechanisms to extract data of historical and contemporary importance, eliciting new knowledge. Disconnections will be highlighted and former connections illuminated. The key relationships that are revealed will be essential tools towards addressing the very real architectural and spatial issues within inner-city Belfast communities. Such analysis will present a new perspective to the social, political, economic, cultural and spatial factors that shaped physical change in this community in a distinct and extreme period in cultural history.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>A major impact of this review process will be the direct engagement of the review findings with the key stakeholders responsible for urban regeneration policy and strategy review, and social housing policy review. These agencies, The Department for Social Development and The Northern Ireland Housing Executive, are included as project partners in this review process. This engagement will be facilitated through a structured Stakeholder Engagement Workshop that will take place in August 2012.

A key objective of this workshop will be to support the formation of a Stakeholder Working Group that will maintain progressive discussions beyond the review period and help promote public sector impact. The workshop will address the issue of which agency is most appropriately placed to steer this issue forward.

Community representation will also form a key part of the Stakeholder Engagement Workshop and this will impact positively on this element of the general public. This Workshop will include specific activities that have been designed to bring members of the community into this engagement process, empowering them with the ability to be equitable participants. The active inclusion of community consultation in the review will form evidence-based findings that can feed readily in a mechanism that promotes policy change beyond the review period, as envisaged in the Stakeholder Working Group. This will help promote cultural change within a community that is disenfranchised and suffers high levels of social deprivation.

There will also be impact on Third Sector agencies related to this review. The East Belfast Community Development Agency and East Belfast Mission are project partners that have established third sector agency initiatives promoting health and well being in East Belfast. Both agencies will be collaborators in the Stakeholder Engagement Workshop. This process will engage these agencies with the review process and findings, thus fostering relationships. This process of engagement will link the real issues that are highlighted by the review with Third Sector agencies with the established infrastructure to help ameliorate these issues

The review process employs a developing methodology that is applied to a case study context. A major academic impact of this work will be its transferability to other contexts, where communities are impacted upon by conflict and where built structures can be distilled and interpreted to reveal historical information. This methodological inquiry provides an innovative approach to the Arts &amp;amp; Humanities and will be of interest to related researchers. This methodology and the new knowledge that it provides will be brought to the international academic community through articles in journals like the Journal of Architecture and History of Photography. A peer-review Workshop will take place in May 2012. The purpose of this activity is to further develop the research findings, in-progress, with acknowledged experts in the field, such as Eyal Weizmann (Professor of Spatial &amp;amp; Visual Cultures, Goldsmiths College, London), Stephen Graham (School of Architecture, Newcastle University), Mark Power (Professor of Photography, Brighton University) and David Campany (Reader in Photography, University of Westminster). This will be a multi-disciplinary meeting discussing inter-disciplinary research methodologies and provides a mechanism for knowledge exchange between the participants. The School of Architecture &amp;amp; Design has been developing a research focus in the area of Architecture, The Troubles and The Community, which this research would boost. A follow-up Symposium hosted by the School would disseminate the review findings to a wider research audience both within the University and amongst policy makers, politicians and the community.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-10</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>27177</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>East Belfast Partnership</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>EBP</gtr:description><gtr:id>6F4DB750-71FA-4401-AEC7-36FD2DFF9C49</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Project partner in this related AHRC award.

A transferable 'stakeholder engagement workshop' format has been developed. This workshop can be used where a specific built environment is to be investigated by a range of expert and non-expert stakeholders. The workshop investigates what local residents have to say about the conditions, experiences, problems and changes of their neighbourhoods. These workshops provide a unique opportunity to reveal what communities have to say about the architecture therein; its conditions, experiences, problems and changes.

The workshops are multi-disciplinary, utilising data generated from collaboration between architectural and photographic research, and the facilitation expertise of community partners.

This event enabled the registering of interest of a range of local residents and organised community representatives who then attended a follow-up stakeholder engagement workshop.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54626fd0250923.11590300</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>AA Research Symposium</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>12EEA6F9-FD2D-4CBD-8B3D-5C196C3D5BD0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The developed research findings were then brought to a cross-disciplinary peer-review panel drawn from a national academic membership (architecture and photography) at the Architectural Association in London in January 2013. This workshop had three distinct sessions: review of initial findings; review of collaborative methodology; pathways for further research.

This symposium had two notable impacts:
Clarification of follow-on research objectives and methods;

Moreover, this engagement process helped engage local residents in a structured research process with community partners and professional stakeholders from the Northern Ireland Housing Executive, Planning Service of Northern Ireland, Belfast Regeneration Office and Strategic Investment Board of Northern Ireland.

East Belfast Partnership have proven capacity in community development and urban regeneration initiative delivery and their involvement as a project partner in this research process has allowed them to further develop this capacity. Engagement in a structured research process with experienced academic researchers and local community residents has led to the to co-production of knowledge that will benefit pertinent urban regeneration and social housing policy discussions. The Workshop Report, co-produced by East Belfast Partnership and local grass-roots community organisations translate the research findings into a transferable format that can be used for further engagement with social and urban regeneration initiatives. The process of compiling and producing the report has also offered a key mechanisms for exchange and enhancement of specialist knowledge, skills and expertise between academic partners and these important community partners. 

The development and delivery of this workshop requires a specialist expertise that has been developed through this process. This workshop and community partner will be central to the follow-on funding application AH/M001342/1 where East Belfast Partnership will mentor and co-deliver further stakeholder engagement workshops with Belfast's four other social partnerships: North, South, West and Greater Shankill. The workshop builds on the 'Spaceshaper' workshop format first established by the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE) and now administered by the Landscape Institute (LI). Spaceshaper was conceived to facilitate the investigation of recreational space by everyday users of public spaces, with a dedicated website that accepts data gathered in the workshop and generates illustrations of the findings. The engagement-workshop format that has developed from this research, and its inner-city focus, will lead to the development of an Urban Spaceshaper variant. The research team will work with the Landscape Institute through the follow-on funded project, to accredit this transferable format for use by communities to investigate urban space and produce an illustrated record of findings suitable for a range of related uses. All partnerships have a proven record of engaging professional stakeholders and community representatives in constructive, inclusive discussions. This collaboration offers the opportunity to develop and enhance skills and expertise in this area.

The establishment of these aforementioned mechanisms provided a variety of opportunities for in-kind collaboration between an innovative inter-disciplinary team encompassing community and academic partners. This offered the opportunity to exchange expertise in knowledge and methods between disciplines and to facilitate knowledge-exchange between academic and community partners. This collaboration also establishes a networking infrastructure for future talks, lectures and briefings on subject matter beyond the research context.

This research has also had impact on policy development within the Northern Ireland context. The stakeholder engagement workshop involved key government project partners and the discussions therein, and data generated, have been germane to the follow-on funded project AH/M001342/1 and a collaborative research team that involves key policy maker project partners from government: the Office for First Minister and deputy First Minister (OFMdFM); the Department of Justice (DoJ); and Belfast City Council (BCC). OFMdFM and DoJ are responsible for the Together: Building a United Community Strategy, the key policy ambition for the Northern Ireland Executive. This follow-on project has the capacity to influence policy formulation in the areas of housing, physical development, public safety and social regeneration. These cross-cutting themes are united under the united community strategy and involve a range of government departments. Project partner OFMdFM will facilitate dissemination of the research findings to the related departmental agencies as the research progresses. Two Policy Symposia provide a structured forum ensuring emerging research findings are critically considered in relation to policy objectives. An experienced and inter-disciplinary research team cover built environment, social policy, post-conflict transformation and community engagement, offering a highly relevant and cross-cutting forum for the discussion of future policy. This team will develop collaborative Discussion Papers that will be evaluated with government partners through the symposia mechanisms to produce Departmental Working Papers that clarify policy implications in relation to the Together: Building a United Community Strategy. Moreover, in 2015 a range of planning powers in Northern Ireland will be transferred from central to local government. Local government Project Partner Belfast City Council will organize and chair a series of structured Briefing Sessions during the research process to ensure that research findings are disseminated to the full range of related council agencies responsible for the development of local community plans and eventual management and regulation of these areas.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>92E59BE6-06EA-4B10-A6FF-BA6444B507BA</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5461dfb62c3359.68138973</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Three significant findings have emerged from this research:

1: The research hypothesised a policy gap which has been substantiated through the research project. The Together: Building a United Community Strategy is the main policy framework addressing the spatial legacy of the Northern Ireland conflict. However this document focuses on known 'Interface' architecture such as the widely recognised 'peace walls'. This research project has substantiated the presence of another architectural legacy of the Northern Ireland conflict that fits the criteria to be addressed by current policy, but which is not under that policy radar. The credible evidence supported through the research findings has been used to build a collaborative cross-disciplinary research team for a funded follow-on project (AH/M001342/1) comprising academia, community and policy makers, which will now examine this research context especially in relation to government policy objectives.

2: This funded research has also helped develop and test a stakeholder engagement workshop format for the investigation of space by specialist and non-specialist actors (as discussed in the Narrative) that will now be taken forward and applied in a city wide study in a follow-on funded project (AH/M001342/1).

3: The research fieldwork led to the emergence of a related research trajectory concerning a further related policy gap within the east Belfast policy regeneration context. This spin-off research project was written up in the publication: Reflections on Titanic Quarter: the cultural and material legacy of an historic Belfast brand. (DOI:10.1080/13602365.2013.804855TQ).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Research findings will be primarily taken forward by way of follow-on funded research project AH/M001342/1.

Research processes have led to the generation of innovative, high quality fine art photographic outputs and architectural spatial analysis. These outputs will be supplemented and expanded through project AH/M001342/1. The research team have been approached confidentially by a major international gallery to discuss the development of an exhibition of these, and further, research findings. The funder will be kept fully informed as this
