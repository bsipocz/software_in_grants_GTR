Amazonia is a critically important biome in terms of: potential impacts of development (e.g. deforestation), sustainability of indigenous peoples and their livelihood, and sustainability of biodiversity and ecosystem services with global impact. Modern land uses such as urbanization, intensive agriculture or extensive conversion to pasture is already showing devastating effects on Amazonian biodiversity. Until recently, the Amazon was considered to be pristine forest, barely occupied by people in the past. Researchers have now come to agree that at least the riverine areas of the basin were densely occupied While there is keen awareness of contemporary anthropic effects, Amazonia is in fact a laboratory for investigation of long-term impacts of anthropic influence. Emerging technologies will shed light on ancient human footprints on biodiversity which in turn will help us to better understand current and future anthropic impacts and potentially develop mitigation strategies which will inform national and global efforts towards biodiversity conservation and sustainability.

The overarching objective of this project is to implement and demonstrate a novel approach to investigation of anthropic impacts on biodiversity in the Amazonian rainforest. This will be achieved by developing a multidisciplinary team that includes remote sensing expertise, archaeologists, and plant biodiversity expertise. Our plan is to demonstrate the usefulness and power of integrating ground-based spectral analysis of vegetation (NIR - near infrared spectroscopy) with aerial survey data using NIR to develop a method for analysing local biodiversity that is scalable to much larger areas by remote sensing. This will enable analysis of the impact of past human activity on biodiversity, and it will also enable investigation of that human footprint across a larger landscape. The programme of work includes a UK inception workshop, a Brazilian workshop, and a field demonstration project. 

This project has grown out of scientific networks established under STFC/NERC Global Challenges Network on Bioinformatics and Environmental Omics. Networking activities through these programmes have also established an interface with the &amp;quot;Terra Preta de Indio Network&amp;quot; (TPInet: http://tpinet.org).

The purpose of the present STFC Futures proposal is to consolidate a potential research network involving EOS and integrating across strengths at STFC RAL-Space (remote sensing), St Andrews (plant diversity and conservation), RBG Kew (plant diversity and conservation, remote sensing), Cardiff (TPINet)., and USP, Brazil (archaeology) to develop advanced remote sensing technologies for investigation of long-term anthropic impacts on Amazonian ecosystems.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>There are many aspects of this project that are topical and of inherent interest and potential use to a wide range of audiences.

Brazil is listed as an ODA country on the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development Assistance Committee (DAC) list. Amazonia in particular is a target for much-needed economic development. Improved understanding of historical impacts and contemporary biodiversity that would arise from this project would support integration of conservation with regional development goals.

Acre is one of only two states in the Brazilian Amazon that has legislation in place to support Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES). Rapid survey techniques to enhance and accelerate understanding of the history and diversity of Acre's forests (which still cover nearly 90% of the area of the state) will be important to ensure that the areas of greatest value (in cultural and biodiversity terms) are recognised and factored into the implementation of PES and other regional development schemes.

In terms of public engagement, almost anyone who learns about this project would find it fascinating. Archaeology, ancient civilisations, the Amazon, tropical rainforests, UAVs. We have it all. Neves and his archaeological work has been featured in the popular press as well as television documentaries. There is scope for press releases and even telejournalism through the BBC and other outlets. There are also other opportunities that might arise. RBG Kew, Museu de Arqueologia e Etnologia da USP, and the Rio de Janeiro all have a strong public interface that could provide opportunities for public presentations of this work. Meagher, through his role as Chair of Education and Outreach for the Society for the Study of Evolution has access to multiple opportunities to present scientific findings to broader audiences, in particular secondary school teachers. Mortimer has a strong track record of scientific outreach and could facilitate connections between outputs from this project and UK media and entertainment.

In terms of policy, outputs of this project will have relevance to government policy related to conservation as well as UK and Brazilian negotiations with regard to international conservation efforts. These potential impacts will be facilitated through connections to DEFRA (Meagher, Nic Lughadha) in the UK and to Reflora (Nic Lughadha and Zappi) in Brazil. Meagher in his current Scottish Government role as Trustee of the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh) has a network of professional connections with which he will facilitate awareness of project outputs and their policy implications through Scottish RERAD. There is also substantial potential for direct uptake in practice and organisational policies by conservation NGOs, which will be facilitated through connections to RBG Kew (Nic Lughadha) and the Rio de Janeiro Botanic Garden (Zappi).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>30986</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>84BDA88C-A452-4F91-AF3E-C5853307F521</gtr:id><gtr:title>UAVs in pursuit of plant conservation - Real world experiences</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Ecological Informatics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/967bfb009457b0fe4614ae8d87bfe134"><gtr:id>967bfb009457b0fe4614ae8d87bfe134</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Baena S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5aa9a4ddb14803.39497164</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/P003281/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Archaeology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>1A1A6805-9DC4-4BCE-BC70-9F2AA4FD093B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ecol, biodivers. &amp; systematics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FB535BD0-E265-4C0A-8532-32DCB83A3951</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tools, technologies &amp; methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F4786876-D9A9-404D-8569-BBC813C73074</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Community Ecology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F59367AF-7012-441B-9AD6-B360A3DFA96B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Landscape &amp; Environ.
