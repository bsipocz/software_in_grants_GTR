London</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/J005142/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>London is a complex environment for Knowledge Exchange and cultural and creative interactions. It faces distinctive challenges as it attempts to sustain global competiveness in the Creative Economy, particularly in terms of digital innovation. Creativeworks London builds on the London Centre for Arts and Cultural Exchange (LCACE), a seven year partnership of nine London-based Higher Education Institutions: Birkbeck College, City University, the Courtauld Institute, Goldsmiths College, Guildhall, King's College London, Queen Mary University of London, Royal Holloway and University of the Arts. We will be joined by smaller specialist organisations such as the University of London's Centre for Creative Collaboration, Central School of Speech and Drama, Roehampton, SOAS, Kingston and Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance and by major cultural organisations such as the BBC, the British Museum,the V&amp;amp;A and the British Library. We will be liaising with the London Mayor's office and the Tech City Investment Company (part of UK Trade and Investment), and UK-wide groups such as the Creative and Cultural Skills Council. We will also be working closely with industry partners, both large and small, including IBM, Playgen/ Digital Shoreditch, Mediaclarity and Bellemedia. This enables the Hub to provide a step-change in the multiple and often fragmented approaches to London's Creative Economy and to provide crucial Arts and Humanities interventions into the sector. Crucially, the Hub will also ensure that the importance of these interventions are widely recognised by business, policy-makers and government. 

To do so, it will undertake research into London's previous and current attempts to implement creative economy strategies; investigate the special requirements of London's digital economy and the relationship that London's audiences have between the live and the digital experience of performances and artefacts. The Hub's Knowledge Exchange programme focuses on 'Creative Vouchers' where Arts &amp;amp; Humanities researchers will offer a range of services (such as historical information that the Media would like to access, policy overviews, IP advice, digital solutions, alternative approaches to business models or practices) which can be accessed by SMEs. The scheme will also allow us to track the sector's changing needs, feeding back into our research into London's distinctive creative economy. There will also be a 'People Exchange Scheme' for both postgraduate researchers who want to experience industry and entrepreneurs who would benefit from a period of time within an HEI environment. 

The combination of excellent research and innovative KE will ensure that Creativeworks London provides a strategic overview and network support. This will be essential if London, and hence the UK, is to cultivate entrepreneurial capacity and facilitate new routes to markets in inter-related fields such as digital media, music, fashion and the visual arts.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This Hub focuses on London and will primarily target London-based SMEs and Cultural Organisations along with national and international organisations who are interested in the specific issues that London's Creative Economy poses. However, our work will also be relevant for other UK regions and for international communities, and offers opportunities for comparative research and KE. 

Creativework London's key targets are: 

2.1 London's creative and cultural workers, micro-enterprises and SMEs: Our SME partners want practical solutions to immediate problems, particularly around emerging markets and business opportunities; they would also like to see financial reward for their participation in the Hub. Our Creative Vouchers scheme, People Exchange and Networking schemes are designed to make an immediate difference for this community while our research into creative enterprise mentorship will ensure that the support delivered is relevant to their needs.

2.2 Policy Makers in London, the UK and Internationally: The Mayoral advisor on arts and culture has noted that,'there is much rhetoric about London's 'creativity' but policy makers need a clear understanding of how this sector works, and the factors that shape its success.' (London's Creative Workforce 2009) The Research Clusters will offer this insight, ensuring that we will be able to both support the delivery of London's new Cultural Strategy and, at the same time, offer a much needed critical perspective. The work will also have relevance to other UK centres, allowing for comparative work with other Hubs, and provide evidence for innovation development in other global cities. 

2.3 London's Cultural Organisations: London's museums, libraries, performance venues and arts organisations have considerable research expertise and audience data which they would like to share with private partners, each other, and with HEIs. They recognise their complex web of relationships with users and creative content suppliers and are interested in understanding the needs of both. Cultural Organisations are also increasingly keen to develop wider digital capacity. Our Research Clusters into the digital economy, skills and audiences will benefit their needs. Finally these organisations are regularly approached by academics for help and often cannot manage the multiplicity of partnership requests and have asked for a filtering system that would enable them to develop long-term KE relationships while not excluding new players. Our 'Single Portal' approach will meet this goal, allowing Cultural Organisations access to all our partners who represesent a very broad range of London's HEIs and specialist Colleges. 

Our KE brokerage service will facilitate experimental interactions between HEIs of different sizes and scales, Independent Research Organisations and SMEs through schemes such as:
1. Creative Vouchers modelled on NESTA's creative credits that allow SMEs access to HEI expertise as a taster for further interactions, including access to collaborative research opportunities, skills and space, new forms of mentorship and creative lab time 
2. A flexible fund to support interactions that enable mobility between organisations including internships for SMEs in HEI spaces and for postgraduates in SME environments
3. EPSRC-style Sandpit and 'Bright Ideas' brain-storming sessions to bring together interdisciplinary/HEI and business partners to network and address emerging problems
4.

Our presentation for the Imitarium explores ideas of time, memory, and the immeasurable poignancy of the present moment.
Samuel Beckett's poem 'Serena 1' is an account of a walking journey through London. We chose to accompany the poem with old film footage of the city, not as an illustration, but rather as a response to the thoughts and images of the poem. As we put the footage together, the character of an old man full of memories began to emerge. The woman in the hologram is a counterpoint to him; perhaps she is his mother, perhaps his lover. She follows her own pathway through the poem, expressing her own relationship to the film, and to the viewer. Looking out at us with a haunting gaze, she challenges us to follow her through time, into memory.
Our presentation showcases the work of several of Creativeworks London's partners. The dancer, Lucy Dundon, is from Trinity Laban. The narrator, Professor Ian Christie, is from Birkbeck. The film footage is from two DVDs, published by the BFI and Birkbeck. The director and producer - Sin&amp;eacute;ad O'Neill and Jana Riedel - are part of the core Creativeworks London team. We hope you enjoy the fruits of our collaboration!</gtr:description><gtr:id>B30BCA70-BDD0-4524-BFBE-FD5FEC8C2C70</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presented at AHRC Creative Economy Showcase, March 2014 to an invited public of SMEs, entrepreneurs, researchers, funders and policymakers.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>589b0c2adadb45.59110172</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>The Imitarium: Creativeworks London</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.creativeworkslondon.org.uk/cw-press/the-imitarium-creativeworks-london/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Goldsmiths, University of London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Creative Routes</gtr:description><gtr:id>7B24535D-A100-4441-A245-8A807B618BDC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Full Outputs and Outcomes will be updated in the run up to the Creative Works London festival taking place at King's College London on Friday the 29th of April 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e006197b7853.48589232-3</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Creative Routes is a unique collaboration between Talawa Theatre Company, Emergency Exit Arts and Goldsmiths, University of London that diversifies the field of Participatory Arts by providing an alternative route into employment in the sector.

The pilot project ran in academic year 2012/2013 and saw 4 emerging practitioners gain access to:

on-the-job training and specialist skills workshops with Talawa and EEA
skills workshops led by the MA Applied Theatre cohort at Goldsmiths College
practical classes led by practitioners and academics through Goldsmiths' MA in Applied Theatre
other professionals through Participatory Arts London (a collective of London-based Participatory Arts organisations and practitioners)

The project sought to provide development for the vocational trainees, but it was found that it also enriched the learning of the academy-based students. We plan to undertake research into the effects of the partnership:

What impacts does this collaboration have on the career development of the emerging practitioners (both trainees and students)?
Can the peer support created within the project be sustained and developed into a professional network as trainees progress into increasingly hectic and often solitary freelance careers?
What can SMEs learn from providing this form of training: how does opening up the rationale behind a company's participatory arts practice help shape it? What knowledge/skills can be transferred to supporting the participant-professional transition in other areas of the company?
What is the impact on the HEI and how is their work affected by the interaction between trainees, students and course content?</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Creative Works London had made a grant of &amp;pound;13503.16 to carry out the 'Creative Routes' collaborative project, and provided Brokerage, Marketing &amp;amp; PR, Dissemination and general support.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Kingston University London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>London Memories</gtr:description><gtr:id>900E1BC9-8DAF-4CA1-A56D-234A39839359</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Full Outputs and Outcomes will be updated in the run up to the Creative Works London festival taking place at King's College London on Friday the 29th of April 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dff59ed7e680.63290164-2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>This project proposes to use London's locations, buildings, objects and features to bring communities together and celebrate narratives about where they live and work. Initiated through a series of curated &amp;quot;Son et Lumiere&amp;quot; events, it aims to engage communities in creative interaction, and stimulate memories with the aid of existing and created, visual and sonic, tangible and intangible mnemonic triggers. The situated memories are expected to reflect the interest of local communities and create a pool of narrative content reflecting the richness of local culture.

A mobile digital platform for dissemination of community-generated narratives will provide an archive of memories and encourage effective communication with social and multicultural groupings around London sites. Making use of the Google Maps API, we propose signposting of mnemonic triggers with a graphic language responding to the ubiquitous &amp;quot;Blue Plaques&amp;quot; with &amp;quot;Blue Pins&amp;quot;: location markers of ordinary people's memories.

Our aim is to encourage novel types of cultural and social exchange, behaviors and interactions. We plan to encourage the widest demographic involvement, particularly between senior members of the community with younger generations. We expect this interactive process to have a social, cultural and educational impact on existing formal educational institutions, archives and public services, and support diversity and multiculturalism.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Creative Works London had made a grant of &amp;pound;15000 to carry out the 'London Memories' collaborative project, and provided Brokerage, Marketing &amp;amp; PR, Dissemination and general support.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>IJAD Dance Company</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Turning Social Media into a Creative Conversation</gtr:description><gtr:id>79C12A1A-4A0F-4FCA-A9D9-74E34C129C6D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Full Outputs and Outcomes will be updated in the run up to the Creative Works London festival taking place at King's College London on Friday the 29th of April 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e003f41a5a76.41076646-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>We seek to discover a range of methodologies which will enable any performance art organisation to use social media to involve their audiences from around the world in performance work. This is not just to comment about what is happening, but to be an integral part of the process and conversation that puts a work on to the stage. We are seeking to be able to stimulate an audience, not to talk back, but to dance back. How do we stimulate people to want to use twitter in a creative manner, to record themselves and their ideas in response to an artists question and to be an active part in the thinking and creation of a piece. These methodologies need to be able to span age ranges, cultural predilections and current inhibitions towards being creative. As these methodologies will be able to be employed by any performance art organisation and London has a reputation for cultural offering, London will be able to excite and invite the the world in to this vibrant scene more than ever before, which not only promotes the work but higher engagement around a performance is to promotes purchasing, loyalty and attendance.

IJAD will be fulfilling one of its core aims, to bring contemporary dance in to the lives of those who have not experienced it before. By, inviting as many people as possible to physically experience it in this manner we broaden its appeal, strengthening London as a hub for contemporary dance.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Creative Works London had made a grant of &amp;pound;14975 to carry out the 'Turning Social Media into a Creative Conversation' collaborative project, and provided Brokerage, Marketing &amp;amp; PR, Dissemination and general support.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Theatre Peckham</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>What's it worth?

Specifically, the objectives of the project are to find out

what is the significance of the Festival's location and local roots in Shoreditch - is there something specific about Shoreditch that makes the Festival work better there than it would work elsewhere?
who comes to the festival, in terms of both participant demographics and organisations represented including their size, geographical location and industry sector?
why local companies engage in the festival - what benefits they expect, and what they actually gain?

Outputs from the project will constitute a valuable information resource that will be used to plan subsequent activities including next year's Festival.

A tight focus on developments since the 1960s will explore how Britain has quickly moved from a reputation as a culinary wasteland to one of the greatest food cities in the world.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Creative Works London had made a grant of &amp;pound;14830.59 to carry out the 'Cooking in Time' collaborative project, and provided Brokerage, Marketing &amp;amp; PR, Dissemination and general support.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>King's College London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Decoding The Platform-7 Network: Understanding How Collaborative Working Encourages Sense Of Place</gtr:description><gtr:id>DC0DCCCE-3107-4933-A31B-F5FC450814DC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Full Outputs and Outcomes will be updated in the run up to the Creative Works London festival taking place at King's College London on Friday the 29th of April 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dffb9ecef525.58725677-2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Professor Andy Pratt of King's College London and John McKiernan, founder of Platform-7 Events, are exploring how and why knowledge is exchanged between actors in the Platform-7 network, community participants and institutions.

Arts organisations like the Barbican faced a challenge: their audience fall into distinct groups which tend not to overlap. Those interested in architecture tend not to interact with cinema or theatre, for example. The Barbican wanted to increase mobility across cultural sectors, bridging the gaps between these audience groups. For this they must understand audience members' interests and discover those likely to help drive this mobility, having broader interests and/or more influence on others.
Social media provides an opportunity to do this. Audiences already interact online, posting status updates on social networks and conversing about Barbican content. This interaction contains valuable information about who they are, where their interests lie and who the opinion formers are. Chatterbox's technology identified relevant people and tracked their interaction; this project applied academic computational linguistics and audience research to provide new methods for discovering topics and profiling audiences. Research from QMUL drove innovation at Chatterbox, a Tech City SME, and help the Barbican, one of London's major arts hubs.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>&amp;pound;4,875 (Four Thousand Eight Hundred and Seventy Five GBP) in funding.

All public works projects explore how the urban public realm can be shaped by its users and how participation and collaboration can inform a more democratic design process. Public works is increasingly placing itself as a not for profit SME within the field of interim uses in order to establish new eco-civic design practices, most notably through R-Urban, a European network promoting bottom-up strategies which aim to enhance urban resilience by establishing user led facilities on temporarily vacant sites.

Re-valuing Temporary Urban Use' is a collaborative research project to provide the tools for urban practitioners to demonstrate the value(s) of temporary urban use in London.

Our collaborative project brings together practitioners and urban researchers to understand the overlapping systems of values mobilised on the ground by projects of temporary use (e.g. alternative economies, voluntary labour), and their relationship to wider dynamics of urban transformation. Which value(s) are mobilised by temporary uses and who benefits from them?

The project uses a participatory approach to study temporary use in Hackney Wick, which has been selected because it is home to 700+ independent artist studios and small and medium creative industries organisations that reuse formerly vacant buildings on a temporary basis. The project draws on public works' position as a strategic actor in the development and establishment of temporary reuse in Hackney Wick, in dialogue with the London Legacy Development Corporation, currently developing a temporary use strategy to inform the long-term development of the new Olympic Park neighbourhoods.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Creative Works London had made a grant of &amp;pound;10824 to carry out the 'Re-valuing Temporary Urban Use' collaborative project, and provided Brokerage, Marketing &amp;amp; PR, Dissemination and general support.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>The Creative Economy Partnership of Creativeworks London</gtr:description><gtr:id>BC237B9B-47AE-4F90-83CB-4A3236ABA2FD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The outputs and outcomes achieved through The Creative Economy Partnership of Creativeworks London will be showcased at the Creativeworks Festival on 29th April 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e2a8816ddc79.30824319-3</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>tbc</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>tbc</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Soda Ltd</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Mobile Constructor</gtr:description><gtr:id>5E53F09C-31FF-42D3-A22F-A9F55CDDA4E1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Full Outputs and Outcomes will be updated in the run up to the Creative Works London festival taking place at King's College London on Friday the 29th of April 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dff4e450a458.19987250-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>We aim to prototype a version of the hugely successful and BAFTA-winning online creative physics simulator Sodaconstructor for mobile devices (iOS initially) and utilize the APIs of these mobiles to locate models in real-world space.

For instance, inspired by the London Eye someone may create a Sodaconstructor model that looks and moves like the Eye and 'locate' it there. Theatre audiences or museum visitors may produce models in response to what they have experienced and share them with others with the app when they visit that location.

The models can also be shared across the web, emailed or publicized on social media.

For many fashion and textile design SMEs, breaking into existing networks is difficult as there is a culture of secrecy about contacts and processes. This project encourages the opening of these networks to enable new SMEs (many micro and start-up businesses) to find appropriate collaborators and partners for their work, while allowing established companies to benefit from open data to develop their businesses.

Cally Calls is a project exploring the multiple voices of a very local place and testing approaches for collective learning about, and dissemination of, local identity. Through this artist-led research we aim to present a distinct and confident voice for 'The Cally' to engage meaningfully and productively with our new neighbours.

Seven artists will be paired with seven individuals who live and work in 'The Cally'. Some might have a life-long relationship with this place, some a more recent one. They will between them form an unscientific representative sampling of age, stage and perspective, and individually each hold a unique knowledge of this place. Each pairing will walk and talk 'The Cally' and attempt to distil a definition of place. The artists will bring these unique perspectives to a public outcome through a series of artworks in a public exhibition at the heart of the Cally Festival.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Creative Works London had made a grant of &amp;pound;15000 to carry out the 'Cally Calls' collaborative project, and provided Brokerage, Marketing &amp;amp; PR, Dissemination and general support.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Roehampton University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Drama, Theatre and Performance</gtr:department><gtr:description>Research ledTraining to Develop Co-Created and Immersive Stories</gtr:description><gtr:id>047C632F-6C59-4D64-BCA0-65BA107F4052</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Full Outputs and Outcomes will be updated in the run up to the Creative Works London festival taking place at King's College London on Friday the 29th of April 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dff8ffd66dc7.65893047-2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>This project will design and implement a pilot development programme for Stellar Network's talent pool.

A key legacy of the project will be a new online tool for co-created performance, hosted and branded by BAC initially, but readily scalable within the London Theatre Consortium and beyond.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Creative Works London had made a grant of &amp;pound;14905 to carry out the 'Scratchr.net: Digital Collaboration between Artists, Audiences, and Producers' collaborative project, and provided Brokerage, Marketing &amp;amp; PR, Dissemination and general support.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Multiple</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Kingston University London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>The Knowledge Exchange Delivery Partnership of Creativeworks London</gtr:description><gtr:id>321ED3CD-B9BE-44C5-916F-5F39D1067951</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The outputs and outcomes achieved through the Knowledge Exchange Delivery Partnership of Creativeworks London will be showcased at the Creativeworks Festival on 29th April 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e03b0bc35fa7.34731934-10</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>All Knowledge Exchange delivery partners of Creativeworks London supported the idea of a Knowledge Exchange Hub through a letter of support at the stage of funding application.

This project is central to Peckham Platform's status as a new National Portfolio Organisation to become a hub for commissioning and promoting meaningful and accessible social arts practice.

The project will involve five visual arts organisations that commission social arts practice, including Peckham Platform. It will identify the different ways in which this practice is initiated and produced, through interviews and a focus group with these organisations and their networks.

This research will pose the following questions: What is the starting point for a commission? How are decisions made? Who is involved in the decision making process? The project aims to increase understanding, improve transparency and strengthen communication between practitioners, organisations, partners and audiences by clarifying and sharing what is good, effective professional practice. Peckham Platform and other organisations within this network will use it to inform their work with local communities and partners.

Our main aim is for young Londoners to have a voice so they can better represent themselves in society. We run Reprezent 107.3FM, London's only youth-led radio station, which broadcasts full-time across the capital. All programming and content is developed by a wide range of young people who have completed training with us to ensure the station reflects their interests and values. We work with organisations and local authorities to facilitate their engagement with young people.

What is measured and how it is measured is sometimes divorced from what is valued by an organisation. This project seeks to reduce the distance between the two by focusing on the values, needs and actors of the enterprise.

As part of this collaboration, we will run a pilot radio campaign. Young people will not only create the content and deliver the show, but also decide the topic of the campaign itself (which to date is often imposed by funders) and assess the whole process.

In partnership between Birkbeck's Centre for Contemporary Literature, with Professor Roger Luckhurst as the supervising academic, and Serendip, this project will conduct a cultural investigation into the contemporary definitions and value of Geek Culture as an important subsection of consumer culture. The Geek Pound, with the name chosen deliberately, as a reference to other consumer segments such as the Pink Pound (LGBT consumers) and the Green Pound (environmental consumers), will provide the central concept for investigating what science fiction fans offer mainstream cultural enterprises as a significant consumer group and how the cultural value of such a group might be defined.

For instance, inspired by the London Eye someone may create a Sodaconstructor model that looks and moves like the Eye and 'locate' it there. Theatre audiences or museum visitors may produce models in response to what they have experienced and share them with others with the app when they visit that location.

The models can also be shared across the web, emailed or publicized on social media. Users will also be invited to explore the science and engineering behind the app, learning through play if they wish. Technically speaking, the code will be ported from Java to iOS and the user interface heavily optimized for the smaller screen. For this pilot we will use the existing Sodaconstructor look and feel to produce a fully- functional prototype which will reveal models in the player when in the target location.

This new partnership will bring together specialist local knowledge and creative research skills, with the aim of maintaining and developing connections within the local community. The overarching aim is to re-engage the local, positioning Arcola as a local offering, while meshing this with its wider placed audience in a sustainable place- based marketing strategy that will build the earned revenues, crucial to the future development of the organisation.

Arcola is a recognised cultural anchor for the diverse communities of Dalston. This previously highly deprived area of London is at a pivotal point of changing local demographics (gentrification). Better transport links, increasing property prices, nearby Tech City initiatives, and Olympics-related urban regeneration have had significant impact upon the local landscape. Arcola must maintain and grow local audiences and engage the communities old and new in shaping the place to meet local needs.

This project will develop an intellectual framework for an ongoing new strand of work - Arcola Local - and pilot the first intervention(s) of the programme.

The project will extend existing strategic plans for Arcola Theatre (as recognised in our National Portfolio Organisation agreement with Arts Council England) by reinvigorating engagement with local audiences. The project aims to assist in developing tools and an action plan for the next three years' work, embracing core marketing, creative learning and operations which will deliver the ideas, tools and direction to bring Arcola to a position of excellence and with a strong point of difference.

We wish to explore this phenomenon. What appeals most to cinema audiences? How does the experience of watching opera on screen differ from the experience of seeing live opera in a theatre? Do cinema screenings create new audiences for live opera in theatres? By addressing such questions, ETO hopes to better understand the audience experience at opera screenings and, in turn, reshape our audience development strategy.

ETO wishes to partner with the Understanding Audiences research programme at Guildhall School of Music &amp;amp; Drama, led by Professor John Sloboda. Working with the Barbican Marketing and Cinema Departments, we will engage London audiences that attend opera screenings (primarily of 'Met Opera Live') and gather data about their experience through questionnaires and focus group discussions. The Guildhall research team will design the research and analyse the data to draw qualified conclusions about the audience experience at cinema screenings.

Many visitors chance upon the monument accidently and, although immediately captivated by the tragic stories, there is currently no onsite facility or insitu opportunity for them to discover more. Because of its listed status, it is not possible to physically attach any form of interpretation to the tablets themselves and so another method of delivering information is required.

This project will employ Augmented Reality and Image Recognition technology, delivered via mobile platforms, to bring to life the fascinating history of the monument and, in particular, illuminate the everyday lives and heroic deaths of those commemorated. A wealth of academic research already undertaken on each of the heroic incidents will be creatively transformed into a flexible and interactive user experience in which pertinent historical information is digitally overlaid upon each tablet when viewed through the camera of a mobile device.

PYP involves both site-specific elements and an online playable game (accessed on tablets and mobiles) that brings people together around the challenge to draw, build and play a better future for their neighbourhood. PYP was developed alongside urban planners and its first iteration, funded by ACE East, engaged 2500 people in Essex, with an expected online audience of around 20,000.

The goal is to develop PYP as an international network of community located place-based games online, helping to consolidate Furtherfield's identity as a key digital arts organization in London and internationally. This will involve:

i) investigating how audiences engage with PYP including their experiences of empowerment.

ii) developing a technical brief to utilize the location-aware capabilities of mobile devices, enabling users to create, share and play games related to their real-time locations

iii) explore how the PYP software has already been and could be used to; enhance audiences' place engagements; increase the time and duration of audience engagement, and reach audiences new to art.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Creative Works London had made a grant of &amp;pound;12675.08 to carry out the 'Mobilising Play Your Place' collaborative project, and provided Brokerage, Marketing &amp;amp; PR, Dissemination and general support.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>London First</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>The Creative Economy Partnership of Creativeworks London</gtr:description><gtr:id>063DB50A-B00A-4D4F-B377-4B4DCA8D28E2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The outputs and outcomes achieved through The Creative Economy Partnership of Creativeworks London will be showcased at the Creativeworks Festival on 29th April 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e2a8816ddc79.30824319-12</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>tbc</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>tbc</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Victoria and Albert Museum</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>The Knowledge Exchange Delivery Partnership of Creativeworks London</gtr:description><gtr:id>14E2A18D-2F35-4007-B57C-676664DADB37</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The outputs and outcomes achieved through the Knowledge Exchange Delivery Partnership of Creativeworks London will be showcased at the Creativeworks Festival on 29th April 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e03b0bc35fa7.34731934-19</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>All Knowledge Exchange delivery partners of Creativeworks London supported the idea of a Knowledge Exchange Hub through a letter of support at the stage of funding application.

By providing value for money workspace for artists across London, and offering a comprehensive artist support structure, SPACE actively promotes creative and technological innovation and consolidates the positioning of artists in society.

SPACE has a creative effect or agency in the city that is rich, but hard to measure in conventional terms. The 700 art and design tenants in 18 studio buildings in London and the multitude of programmes, exhibitions and activities related to special interest audiences, present a complex matrix of operations (both physical and virtual) which evades capture. Yet demonstrating the distributed audiences for SPACE is critical in order to leverage ongoing support.

This project will investigate and test creative ways to demonstrate SPACE's value and reach. Since it is arguable that the multiple social, cultural, spatial and economic values of SPACE are impossible to communicate through conventional empirical tools and mechanisms, the project will utilize three-dimensional visualization and composite communication techniques. Visual mapping and diagramming has the capacity to make hybrid representations of other values which extend beyond the metric alone, capturing a wider range of scales and qualities - from the local and spatial to the global and virtual. 

In composing a visual representation that can stretch to accommodate these values, the project attempts to develop a compelling narrative that can be used by SPACE as advocacy for the value of artists in society, and therefore facilitate ongoing support (financial and policy) for their role in the championing of artists.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Creative Works London had made a grant of &amp;pound;15000 to carry out the 'Mapping the Distributed Audience' collaborative project, and provided Brokerage, Marketing &amp;amp; PR, Dissemination and general support.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Guildhall School of Music &amp; Drama</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>The Knowledge Exchange Delivery Partnership of Creativeworks London</gtr:description><gtr:id>368D45AC-C26B-4BAB-A0E2-10D6F99A469D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The outputs and outcomes achieved through the Knowledge Exchange Delivery Partnership of Creativeworks London will be showcased at the Creativeworks Festival on 29th April 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e03b0bc35fa7.34731934-7</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>All Knowledge Exchange delivery partners of Creativeworks London supported the idea of a Knowledge Exchange Hub through a letter of support at the stage of funding application.

The project will involve five visual arts organisations that commission social arts practice, including Peckham Platform. It will identify the different ways in which this practice is initiated and produced, through interviews and a focus group with these organisations and their networks.

This research will pose the following questions: What is the starting point for a commission? How are decisions made? Who is involved in the decision making process? The project aims to increase understanding, improve transparency and strengthen communication between practitioners, organisations, partners and audiences by clarifying and sharing what is good, effective professional practice.

The project aims to create a body of accessible research that looks at a mutually beneficial exchange between both parties that is documented and shared more widely within the design community.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Creative Works London had made a grant of &amp;pound;12018 to carry out the 'The power of the collective' collaborative project, and provided Brokerage, Marketing &amp;amp; PR, Dissemination and general support.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Queen Mary University of London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science</gtr:department><gtr:description>Cultural Mobility through Social Intelligence</gtr:description><gtr:id>286C3276-52BE-4BE4-8D4C-875ACAC0BA7B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Full Outputs and Outcomes will be updated in the run up to the Creative Works London festival taking place at King's College London on Friday the 29th of April 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dfefe02ff4b7.76039825-2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>This project will partner Chatterbox with QMUL and the Barbican to produce software to help arts organisations understand and profile their audience via social media, and encourage cultural mobility.

This is not just to comment about what is happening, but to be an integral part of the process and conversation that puts a work on to the stage. We are seeking to be able to stimulate an audience, not to talk back, but to dance back. How do we stimulate people to want to use twitter in a creative manner, to record themselves and their ideas in response to an artists question and to be an active part in the thinking and creation of a piece. These methodologies need to be able to span age ranges, cultural predilections and current inhibitions towards being creative. As these methodologies will be able to be employed by any performance art organisation and London has a reputation for cultural offering, London will be able to excite and invite the the world in to this vibrant scene more than ever before, which not only promotes the work but higher engagement around a performance is to promotes purchasing, loyalty and attendance.

IJAD will be fulfilling one of its core aims, to bring contemporary dance in to the lives of those who have not experienced it before. By, inviting as many people as possible to physically experience it in this manner we broaden its appeal, strengthening London as a hub for contemporary dance.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Creative Works London had made a grant of &amp;pound;14975 to carry out the 'Turning Social Media into a Creative Conversation' collaborative project, and provided Brokerage, Marketing &amp;amp; PR, Dissemination and general support.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Royal Holloway, University of London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Music</gtr:department><gtr:description>(Better) Believe It: Big Journeys, Untold Stories.</gtr:description><gtr:id>77C815EE-556C-4FDE-BDE2-6B25F91B9300</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Full Outputs and Outcomes will be updated in the run up to the Creative Works London festival taking place at King's College London on Friday the 29th of April 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e006b6e56944.78713155-2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Counterpoints Arts, a creative hub working at the intersection of creative arts and film, advocacy and public learning, has been paired with academic Sue Clayton, Reader in Film and Digital Narratives at Royal Holloway, University of London to produce a 'migratory archive', for use as a research tool for agencies working in migration and the global human rights sector.

The outcome will offer opportunities for the audience to be a part of the artistic experience, as co-creators, co-producers and then collaborators in the performance event.

The principal way we aim to achieve this is to develop the design of digital programmes (such as digital audio interface and social media protocols) for managing and facilitating participation and interaction. Once devised, these tools will enable a specially conceived performance event, with online webcasting, in our 2014/15 season, and for other events beyond. 

We need to engage with a wider audience demographic, especially a younger audience for whom the traditional concert hall experience is less appealing. Digital and mobile technologies have become the most effective channel for connecting with this demographic. The project casts audiences as creative partners rather than consumer / listener. The project will also challenge perceptions about how contemporary music and art is made, meaningfully expanding modes of delivery between our organisation and audiences, both at the live event in London and more widely online.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Creative Works London had made a grant of &amp;pound;14800 to carry out the 'London Sinfonietta's CoCurate' collaborative project, and provided Brokerage, Marketing &amp;amp; PR, Dissemination and general support.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>City, University of London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Centre for Cultural and Creative Studies</gtr:department><gtr:description>Networked Value: Understanding the impact of Q-Art</gtr:description><gtr:id>E4E42438-93D4-4EAD-B974-9221909D0825</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Full Outputs and Outcomes will be updated in the run up to the Creative Works London festival taking place at King's College London on Friday the 29th of April 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e001038e1b46.52002281-2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Q-Art is a student and graduate run organisation that aims to break down the barriers to art education and contemporary art and ultimately effect more diverse participation in the art world. We hold open crits across London art colleges for artists of all backgrounds, and work with universities, museums, and galleries to produce publication, videos, and run educational workshops.

The art world, particularly in global cities such as London, is a complex network, where contacts and social links are crucial to success. In the project Networked Value we will work together with Dr. Dave O'Brien, an internationally renowned expert on cultural policy. Our aim will be to explore this world and interrogate the value of Q-Art's work with aspiring artists by tracking the development of their social networks.

Networked Value is based on the established, but underutilised methodology of social network analysis (SNA). SNA involves mapping the relationships people have in their social or work groups. Its most famous application showed how punk began in British art schools through a network of students. It uses a combination of quantitative data to make maps and qualitative data to understand the meanings of relationships. The quantitative SNA data will be combined with video diary keeping by participants, to give a sense of the lived reality of being a part of our open crit programme. The findings of the project will be used by both Q-Art and Dr O'Brien to inform Q-Art's organisational practice and to engage external stakeholders into the complex debates surrounding the production of culture in contemporary London.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Creative Works London had made a grant of &amp;pound;15000 to carry out the 'Networked Value' collaborative project, and provided Brokerage, Marketing &amp;amp; PR, Dissemination and general support.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Furtherfield</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Furtherfield</gtr:description><gtr:id>3E7ED8AD-59FF-426C-83AE-D726FEBCEF4B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Research collaboration

Only Connect see the people they work with as assets, not liabilities, with a contribution to make to their families, communities and wider society.

The project seeks to demonstrate the value of the arts in causing people to cease and refrain from offending, a process known as 'Desistance'. Working collaboratively, IOE will assess OC activities in order to evaluate the role and impact of the creative arts on OC's client group.

The key programme under consideration is OC Create, which provides creative opportunities to Only Connect clients by -

a) Connecting clients to associate artists and creating opportunities for skills development and employment

b) Producing high quality art forms for external consumers, which create opportunity for OC clients and help build bridges with communities

c) Provides daily creative training across other Only Connect programmes, namely, Arts Award qualifications in OC Impact, input into presentation skills training for serving prisoners and so on

The researcher will use a mixed methods approach to evaluate the role of this creative input within Only Connect's delivery and to consider how critical it is to generating change among the client group.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Creative Works London had made a grant of &amp;pound;15000 to carry out the 'Only Connect Arts Research Project' collaborative project, and provided Brokerage, Marketing &amp;amp; PR, Dissemination and general support.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Royal Holloway, University of London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>The Knowledge Exchange Delivery Partnership of Creativeworks London</gtr:description><gtr:id>57F23182-2EA6-4506-81E1-CE38CC27FA1B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The outputs and outcomes achieved through the Knowledge Exchange Delivery Partnership of Creativeworks London will be showcased at the Creativeworks Festival on 29th April 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e03b0bc35fa7.34731934-13</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>All Knowledge Exchange delivery partners of Creativeworks London supported the idea of a Knowledge Exchange Hub through a letter of support at the stage of funding application.

We will work with year 7 students at Stoke Newington School to explore objects relating to friendship, discuss their experiences of friendship and make games, musical instruments and stories using Scratch and MaKey MaKey (open-source interactive design and coding tools). This will contribute to their learning and social development as well as to Whitehouse's research into cultures of friendship.

The second activity is to have two 'Idea Forum' for our partner school, researchers in different disciplines, designers and museums will connect stakeholders, feed their input into the workshop design process and build a robust network for future collaboration within the creative economy and across to educational and heritage organisations. It will provide a channel for the dissemination of project materials and Codasign's growing expertise in creative technologies for education and research.

We already have a very basic 2d prototype but we want to research both 2d and 3d interfaces to understand the optimal UX. Can people customise products more successfully in 3d or is the 3rd dimension overwhelming in a browser based design setting.

Patients visit RLH for dialysis three times per week, each visit lasts five hours. Approx 80% of patients will not receive a kidney transplant and will be on dialysis for the rest of their lives. 

The Renal Unit at RLH is cramped and crowded. We wish to explore ways of improving this micro-locality through activities and design interventions that engage and enrich patients' experience of being in hospital, creating a positive environment and a sense of place and community. 

Through consultation with people who use the space - patients and staff - we will investigate the circumstances and dynamics that shape the experience of being on the unit. We will analyse participants' wants and needs, examining how these might be met by art or design interventions. We will look at which creative activities foster a sense of community and how they do so. We will seek processes and outcomes that impact positively on the space; those which engage, stimulate and uplift and continue to inspire patients over multiple visits.

With a background in literature, film and television, and degree studies in jewellery and silversmithing, Hinder's work seeks to tell thought-provoking stories through beautifully crafted objects.

What would happen if money could offer a different kind of value proposition, and triggered a more creative and enriching means of exchange? This project, called Money No Object, will question prevailing concepts of value, and playfully explore alternative economic ideas within the ecosystem of the Victoria and Albert Museum.

Using design interaction and digital innovation, Money No Object will re-imagine museum foyer donation boxes by introducing a more entertaining and socially interactive process for considering and exchanging value within an arts and cultural institution.

This payment donations system will explore the use of wearable technology and human contact through social gestures (such as a handshake or hug), for visitors to make a financial contribution and generate funds for cultural organisations like the V&amp;amp;A. At the same time, the novel process of donating will aim to re-engage audiences with the broader value of the Museum, build connections between people, and strengthen social cohesion within the Museum's visitor community.

Working closely with the V&amp;amp;A, Money No Object will consider a new significance for material and physical currencies in an increasingly immaterial world, where smart payment transactions are imperceptible, but human emotions, creativity and culture, remain value that money can't buy.

We will research and prepare performance editions of 18th-century musical compositions that show a cross-fertilisation of European with north African styles. From the 17th century onwards, African musicians performed at European courts; European travellers and merchants to north Africa wrote down the indigenous music they heard; and Italian and German composers incorporated exotic African and Ottoman elements in their music.

By making performance editions of these little-known crossover compositions, we will create a repertoire that will appeal to a more socially and ethnically diverse audience than usually attends classical music concerts.

For more than 30 years we have commissioned and produced theatre around the complex theme of women and crime - enlightening and entertaining audiences. Behind the scenes in our London studios, our education programme provides a proven model for helping women in prisons and in the community break the cycle of offending, using theatre education to develop vital personal, professional and educational skills.

This project seeks to better understand, celebrate and share the diverse contributions and value that Clean Break graduates/alumni bring to the cultural landscape and their communities. Gathering, researching and digitally recording the women's stories of success will be one key strand of the project. This will be complemented by a second strand exploring the body of Clean Break's professional plays, and filming extracts performed by the women. This will be used as a key part of our newly designed training programme targeting artists/facilitators/professionals wanting to work in the criminal justice system.

Our students are women with experience of the criminal justice system and women at risk of offending due to drug/alcohol and/or mental health issues. Far too often they are labelled as 'offenders' and described in negative ways regarding the skills they lack, the crime they commit.

Our vision is to develop this into the first co-creative platform for performance, bringing the voice of the audience into direct and dynamic engagement with artists and producers.

For the first time, this online resource will provide curated recordings of scratch performances from our live scratch festivals with a space for audience members to actively contribute to how it develops over time. This project will enable us to discover what translates and does not translate between live scratch and the digital platform, how best to engage audiences in this new format, and how to manage Scratchr.net across our staff team.

All public works projects explore how the urban public realm can be shaped by its users and how participation and collaboration can inform a more democratic design process. Public works is increasingly placing itself as a not for profit SME within the field of interim uses in order to establish new eco-civic design practices, most notably through R-Urban, a European network promoting bottom-up strategies which aim to enhance urban resilience by establishing user led facilities on temporarily vacant sites.

Re-valuing Temporary Urban Use' is a collaborative research project to provide the tools for urban practitioners to demonstrate the value(s) of temporary urban use in London.

Our collaborative project brings together practitioners and urban researchers to understand the overlapping systems of values mobilised on the ground by projects of temporary use (e.g. alternative economies, voluntary labour), and their relationship to wider dynamics of urban transformation. Which value(s) are mobilised by temporary uses and who benefits from them?

The project uses a participatory approach to study temporary use in Hackney Wick, which has been selected because it is home to 700+ independent artist studios and small and medium creative industries organisations that reuse formerly vacant buildings on a temporary basis. The project draws on public works' position as a strategic actor in the development and establishment of temporary reuse in Hackney Wick, in dialogue with the London Legacy Development Corporation, currently developing a temporary use strategy to inform the long-term development of the new Olympic Park neighbourhoods.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Creative Works London had made a grant of &amp;pound;10824 to carry out the 'Re-valuing Temporary Urban Use' collaborative project, and provided Brokerage, Marketing &amp;amp; PR, Dissemination and general support.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of the Arts London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Developing New Programming Models from the Her Noise Archive</gtr:description><gtr:id>37AC80E0-6559-4DF6-9399-9D1C95D2F279</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Full Outputs and Outcomes will be updated in the run up to the Creative Works London festival taking place at King's College London on Friday the 29th of April 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e007a6977ce9.57803647-2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Irene Revell from contemporary art organisation Electra will be working with Professor Cathy Lane from the University of the Arts to help extend Electra's programming models from one-off artists' commissions and projects, to more ongoing programme models, such as education programming, workshops and evening courses.

PYP was developed alongside urban planners and its first iteration, funded by ACE East, engaged 2500 people in Essex, with an expected online audience of around 20,000.

The goal is to develop PYP as an international network of community located place-based games online, helping to consolidate Furtherfield's identity as a key digital arts organization in London and internationally. This will involve:

i) investigating how audiences engage with PYP including their experiences of empowerment.

ii) developing a technical brief to utilize the location-aware capabilities of mobile devices, enabling users to create, share and play games related to their real-time locations

iii) explore how the PYP software has already been and could be used to; enhance audiences' place engagements; increase the time and duration of audience engagement, and reach audiences new to art.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Creative Works London had made a grant of &amp;pound;12675.08 to carry out the 'Mobilising Play Your Place' collaborative project, and provided Brokerage, Marketing &amp;amp; PR, Dissemination and general support.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>School of Oriental and African Studies (University of London)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>The Knowledge Exchange Delivery Partnership of Creativeworks London</gtr:description><gtr:id>6A6260B2-60A1-49F0-8275-D3CBBF5A78A1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The outputs and outcomes achieved through the Knowledge Exchange Delivery Partnership of Creativeworks London will be showcased at the Creativeworks Festival on 29th April 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e03b0bc35fa7.34731934-14</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>All Knowledge Exchange delivery partners of Creativeworks London supported the idea of a Knowledge Exchange Hub through a letter of support at the stage of funding application.

Our main aim is for young Londoners to have a voice so they can better represent themselves in society. We run Reprezent 107.3FM, London's only youth-led radio station, which broadcasts full-time across the capital. All programming and content is developed by a wide range of young people who have completed training with us to ensure the station reflects their interests and values. We work with organisations and local authorities to facilitate their engagement with young people.

What is measured and how it is measured is sometimes divorced from what is valued by an organisation. This project seeks to reduce the distance between the two by focusing on the values, needs and actors of the enterprise.

As part of this collaboration, we will run a pilot radio campaign. Young people will not only create the content and deliver the show, but also decide the topic of the campaign itself (which to date is often imposed by funders) and assess the whole process.

The pilot project ran in academic year 2012/2013 and saw 4 emerging practitioners gain access to:

on-the-job training and specialist skills workshops with Talawa and EEA
skills workshops led by the MA Applied Theatre cohort at Goldsmiths College
practical classes led by practitioners and academics through Goldsmiths' MA in Applied Theatre
other professionals through Participatory Arts London (a collective of London-based Participatory Arts organisations and practitioners)

The project sought to provide development for the vocational trainees, but it was found that it also enriched the learning of the academy-based students. We plan to undertake research into the effects of the partnership:

What impacts does this collaboration have on the career development of the emerging practitioners (both trainees and students)?
Can the peer support created within the project be sustained and developed into a professional network as trainees progress into increasingly hectic and often solitary freelance careers?
What can SMEs learn from providing this form of training: how does opening up the rationale behind a company's participatory arts practice help shape it? What knowledge/skills can be transferred to supporting the participant-professional transition in other areas of the company?

The outcome will offer opportunities for the audience to be a part of the artistic experience, as co-creators, co-producers and then collaborators in the performance event.

The principal way we aim to achieve this is to develop the design of digital programmes (such as digital audio interface and social media protocols) for managing and facilitating participation and interaction. Once devised, these tools will enable a specially conceived performance event, with online webcasting, in our 2014/15 season, and for other events beyond. 

We need to engage with a wider audience demographic, especially a younger audience for whom the traditional concert hall experience is less appealing. Digital and mobile technologies have become the most effective channel for connecting with this demographic. The project casts audiences as creative partners rather than consumer / listener. The project will also challenge perceptions about how contemporary music and art is made, meaningfully expanding modes of delivery between our organisation and audiences, both at the live event in London and more widely online.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Creative Works London had made a grant of &amp;pound;14800 to carry out the 'London Sinfonietta's CoCurate' collaborative project, and provided Brokerage, Marketing &amp;amp; PR, Dissemination and general support.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Song Collectors Collective</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Song Catchers: archiving and promoting oral culture in London</gtr:description><gtr:id>0E1EAD6B-FBC4-4DFA-B7BC-D76CBD5636BF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Full Outputs and Outcomes will be updated in the run up to the Creative Works London festival taking place at King's College London on Friday the 29th of April 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e0079a3a1cb7.66488897-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The Song Collectors Collective (SCC) has an active passion to conserve the rare and ancient oral culture of the world and will be recording and publishing the tradition bearers who still keep our ancient sung and spoken arts alive within their own families and communities.

The situated memories are expected to reflect the interest of local communities and create a pool of narrative content reflecting the richness of local culture.

A mobile digital platform for dissemination of community-generated narratives will provide an archive of memories and encourage effective communication with social and multicultural groupings around London sites. Making use of the Google Maps API, we propose signposting of mnemonic triggers with a graphic language responding to the ubiquitous &amp;quot;Blue Plaques&amp;quot; with &amp;quot;Blue Pins&amp;quot;: location markers of ordinary people's memories.

Our aim is to encourage novel types of cultural and social exchange, behaviors and interactions.

Arts organisations like the Barbican face a challenge: their audience falls into distinct groups which tend not to overlap. Those interested in architecture tend not to interact with cinema or theatre, for example. The Barbican want to increase mobility across cultural sectors, bridging the gaps between these audience groups. For this they must understand audience members' interests and discover those likely to help drive this mobility, having broader interests and/or more influence on others.

Social media provides an opportunity to do this. Audiences already interact online, posting status updates on social networks and conversing about Barbican content. This interaction contains valuable information about who they are, where their interests lie and who the opinion formers are. Chatterbox's technology can identify relevant people and track their interaction; this project will apply academic computational linguistics and audience research to provide new methods for discovering topics and profiling audiences.

The forums provided opportunity for partners to stay in touch, be updated and give feedback on CWL's schemes and research programmes.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Kingston University London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Optimal User Experience for mass customisation of handbags offered by new designers</gtr:description><gtr:id>C2466173-1B9E-41E3-BD53-2A6516795FBC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Full Outputs and Outcomes will be updated in the run up to the Creative Works London festival taking place at King's College London on Friday the 29th of April 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dff8812a8a17.56217233-2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>This project investigates the optimal user experience for consumers to customise handbags. Current implementations already on the market only allow people to change basic shapes, colours and materials and do not allow a realistic realtime model to be seen before purchase. We want to provide a richer more immersive experience with a more sophisticated tool where users can explore scale, texture etc and drag and drop design elements such as zips, pockets etc to anywhere they desire on the bag within manufacturing, ergonomic and aesthetic parameters. 

We already have a very basic 2d prototype but we want to research both 2d and 3d interfaces to understand the optimal UX. Can people customise products more successfully in 3d or is the 3rd dimension overwhelming in a browser based design setting. We intend to use off the shelf 3d modelling libraries to prototype the 3d options.

We will also collaborate with up and coming handbag designers to co develop optimal generative design collections and ensure that designs created can be manufactured at scale.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Creative Works London had made a grant of &amp;pound;15000 to carry out the 'Optimal User Experience ' collaborative project, and provided Brokerage, Marketing &amp;amp; PR, Dissemination and general support.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Clean Break</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Celebrating Success</gtr:description><gtr:id>77E43127-9B8C-4DC9-B928-C504472CBC9D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Full Outputs and Outcomes will be updated in the run up to the Creative Works London festival taking place at King's College London on Friday the 29th of April 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e0056e88f685.32840613-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Clean Break is a producing theatre company with an independent education programme, established by two women prisoners in 1979. For more than 30 years we have commissioned and produced theatre around the complex theme of women and crime - enlightening and entertaining audiences. Behind the scenes in our London studios, our education programme provides a proven model for helping women in prisons and in the community break the cycle of offending, using theatre education to develop vital personal, professional and educational skills.

This project seeks to better understand, celebrate and share the diverse contributions and value that Clean Break graduates/alumni bring to the cultural landscape and their communities. Gathering, researching and digitally recording the women's stories of success will be one key strand of the project. This will be complemented by a second strand exploring the body of Clean Break's professional plays, and filming extracts performed by the women. This will be used as a key part of our newly designed training programme targeting artists/facilitators/professionals wanting to work in the criminal justice system.

Our students are women with experience of the criminal justice system and women at risk of offending due to drug/alcohol and/or mental health issues. Far too often they are labelled as 'offenders' and described in negative ways regarding the skills they lack, the crime they commit. This project will explore and capture the positive impact these women have, enabling others to view them through their contributions to society.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Creative Works London had made a grant of &amp;pound;15000 to carry out the 'Celebrating Success' collaborative project, and provided Brokerage, Marketing &amp;amp; PR, Dissemination and general support.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>The Geffrye Museum of the Home</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>The Creative Economy Partnership of Creativeworks London</gtr:description><gtr:id>4ACECFEE-81D8-4882-AD95-E45660533374</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The outputs and outcomes achieved through The Creative Economy Partnership of Creativeworks London will be showcased at the Creativeworks Festival on 29th April 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e2a8816ddc79.30824319-8</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>tbc</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>tbc</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>CRDM</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Networked Value: Understanding the impact of Q-Art</gtr:description><gtr:id>21A32763-76B8-4B85-9C6D-8DE57419CAAE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Full Outputs and Outcomes will be updated in the run up to the Creative Works London festival taking place at King's College London on Friday the 29th of April 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e001038e1b46.52002281-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Q-Art is a student and graduate run organisation that aims to break down the barriers to art education and contemporary art and ultimately effect more diverse participation in the art world. We hold open crits across London art colleges for artists of all backgrounds, and work with universities, museums, and galleries to produce publication, videos, and run educational workshops.

The art world, particularly in global cities such as London, is a complex network, where contacts and social links are crucial to success. In the project Networked Value we will work together with Dr. Dave O'Brien, an internationally renowned expert on cultural policy. Our aim will be to explore this world and interrogate the value of Q-Art's work with aspiring artists by tracking the development of their social networks.

Networked Value is based on the established, but underutilised methodology of social network analysis (SNA). SNA involves mapping the relationships people have in their social or work groups. Its most famous application showed how punk began in British art schools through a network of students. It uses a combination of quantitative data to make maps and qualitative data to understand the meanings of relationships. The quantitative SNA data will be combined with video diary keeping by participants, to give a sense of the lived reality of being a part of our open crit programme. The findings of the project will be used by both Q-Art and Dr O'Brien to inform Q-Art's organisational practice and to engage external stakeholders into the complex debates surrounding the production of culture in contemporary London.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Creative Works London had made a grant of &amp;pound;15000 to carry out the 'Networked Value' collaborative project, and provided Brokerage, Marketing &amp;amp; PR, Dissemination and general support.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of the Arts London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Towards a knowledge landscape of the fashion and textile industry</gtr:description><gtr:id>04FEDA6D-E461-493C-BF4E-84E7F76A7DA8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Full Outputs and Outcomes will be updated in the run up to the Creative Works London festival taking place at King's College London on Friday the 29th of April 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dffa1b0f50f8.35863059-2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Minified develops a set of internal digital tools that allows us to take a pre-existing set of data and map, visualise and analyse it.

The knowledge landscape of the textile and fashion industry spans design, manufacturing, retail, media and research/innovation. This project creates a virtual network mapping the connectivity within fashion and textile industry, based on actual data, to act as a protocol for open innovation and stimulate potential new collaborations across the enhanced network.

For many fashion and textile design SMEs, breaking into existing networks is difficult as there is a culture of secrecy about contacts and processes. This project encourages the opening of these networks to enable new SMEs (many micro and start-up businesses) to find appropriate collaborators and partners for their work, while allowing established companies to benefit from open data to develop their businesses.

The data will be gathered from the FIREup digital platform, specific project workshops and relevant events such as London Fashion Week.

This new partnership will bring together specialist local knowledge and creative research skills, with the aim of maintaining and developing connections within the local community. The overarching aim is to re-engage the local, positioning Arcola as a local offering, while meshing this with its wider placed audience in a sustainable place- based marketing strategy that will build the earned revenues, crucial to the future development of the organisation.

Arcola is a recognised cultural anchor for the diverse communities of Dalston. This previously highly deprived area of London is at a pivotal point of changing local demographics (gentrification). Better transport links, increasing property prices, nearby Tech City initiatives, and Olympics-related urban regeneration have had significant impact upon the local landscape. Arcola must maintain and grow local audiences and engage the communities old and new in shaping the place to meet local needs.

This project will develop an intellectual framework for an ongoing new strand of work - Arcola Local - and pilot the first intervention(s) of the programme.

The project will extend existing strategic plans for Arcola Theatre (as recognised in our National Portfolio Organisation agreement with Arts Council England) by reinvigorating engagement with local audiences. The project aims to assist in developing tools and an action plan for the next three years' work, embracing core marketing, creative learning and operations which will deliver the ideas, tools and direction to bring Arcola to a position of excellence and with a strong point of difference.

Do cinema screenings create new audiences for live opera in theatres? By addressing such questions, ETO hopes to better understand the audience experience at opera screenings and, in turn, reshape our audience development strategy.

ETO wishes to partner with the Understanding Audiences research programme at Guildhall School of Music &amp;amp; Drama, led by Professor John Sloboda. Working with the Barbican Marketing and Cinema Departments, we will engage London audiences that attend opera screenings (primarily of 'Met Opera Live') and gather data about their experience through questionnaires and focus group discussions.

By providing value for money workspace for artists across London, and offering a comprehensive artist support structure, SPACE actively promotes creative and technological innovation and consolidates the positioning of artists in society.

SPACE has a creative effect or agency in the city that is rich, but hard to measure in conventional terms. The 700 art and design tenants in 18 studio buildings in London and the multitude of programmes, exhibitions and activities related to special interest audiences, present a complex matrix of operations (both physical and virtual) which evades capture. Yet demonstrating the distributed audiences for SPACE is critical in order to leverage ongoing support.

This project will investigate and test creative ways to demonstrate SPACE's value and reach. Since it is arguable that the multiple social, cultural, spatial and economic values of SPACE are impossible to communicate through conventional empirical tools and mechanisms, the project will utilize three-dimensional visualization and composite communication techniques. Visual mapping and diagramming has the capacity to make hybrid representations of other values which extend beyond the metric alone, capturing a wider range of scales and qualities - from the local and spatial to the global and virtual. 

In composing a visual representation that can stretch to accommodate these values, the project attempts to develop a compelling narrative that can be used by SPACE as advocacy for the value of artists in society, and therefore facilitate ongoing support (financial and policy) for their role in the championing of artists.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Creative Works London had made a grant of &amp;pound;15000 to carry out the 'Mapping the Distributed Audience' collaborative project, and provided Brokerage, Marketing &amp;amp; PR, Dissemination and general support.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Playgen Ltd</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>The Creative Economy Partnership of Creativeworks London</gtr:description><gtr:id>41D75FB0-5729-41A6-8809-315C09B61890</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The outputs and outcomes achieved through The Creative Economy Partnership of Creativeworks London will be showcased at the Creativeworks Festival on 29th April 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e2a8816ddc79.30824319-15</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>tbc</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>tbc</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Vital Arts</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>How can the population of the Royal London's Renal Unit transform their micro-locality through art and design interventions?</gtr:description><gtr:id>869D8488-DB6E-448A-950E-40A80F334A8D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Full Outputs and Outcomes will be updated in the run up to the Creative Works London festival taking place at King's College London on Friday the 29th of April 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dffee7e8f0f9.30602056-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>The Renal Unit at the Royal London Hospital (RLH) is one of the largest in Europe, with over 1,200 patients.

The pilot project ran in academic year 2012/2013 and saw 4 emerging practitioners gain access to:

on-the-job training and specialist skills workshops with Talawa and EEA
skills workshops led by the MA Applied Theatre cohort at Goldsmiths College
practical classes led by practitioners and academics through Goldsmiths' MA in Applied Theatre
other professionals through Participatory Arts London (a collective of London-based Participatory Arts organisations and practitioners)

The project sought to provide development for the vocational trainees, but it was found that it also enriched the learning of the academy-based students. We plan to undertake research into the effects of the partnership:

What impacts does this collaboration have on the career development of the emerging practitioners (both trainees and students)?
Can the peer support created within the project be sustained and developed into a professional network as trainees progress into increasingly hectic and often solitary freelance careers?
What can SMEs learn from providing this form of training: how does opening up the rationale behind a company's participatory arts practice help shape it? What knowledge/skills can be transferred to supporting the participant-professional transition in other areas of the company?

POLITICAL DISCOURSES OF PARTICIPATION AND VALUE

The symposium brought together researchers on museum participation and policy in order to produce insights for the research project Everyday Participation. This research project brings together evidence from in-depth historical analyses, the re-use of existing quantitative data and new qualitative research to reveal the detail, dynamics and significance of 'everyday participation'. The aim is to generate new understandings of community formation and capacity through participation, which the team will develop through collaborations with partners and participant groups to evolve better practice for policy makers and cultural organisations.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dedcafed5e45.60270387</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Discussing the multi-dimensional characteristics of London's creative workspaces: a summary of CWL's Creative Hubs Symposium</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>99398366-6A61-41D1-B1F8-675CC1F048F2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A blog post reporting on an event that included over 60 policy makers, third sector organisations, academics and others.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56ded4ff871e67.58460144</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.cwlblog.org.uk/discussing-the-multi-dimensional-characteristics-of-londons-creative-workspaces/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Birbeck Univeristy News 'Movements: The June Givanni Pan-African Cinema Archive'</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>55F7F640-B44B-4FC2-8FF8-798B365B5B27</gtr:id><gtr:impact>News feature from Birbeck University regarding The June Givanni Pan-African Cinima Archive project.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e16a8494b514.87703586</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.bbk.ac.uk/arts/news/movements-the-june-givanni-pan-african-cinema-archive</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Renal recipe Swap at Tate Exchange</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8BF69901-870A-4594-8EF3-0E4D8BF4E550</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Join Vital Arts and Central Saint Martins for a weekend exploring the challenges and possibilities

It was a culmination of the work the hub had achieved over the past four years. Showing a large number of projects that had been supported through CWL's various funding schemes, the hub also presented outcomes of CWL's research strands and core hub activities.
Over 11 spaces CWL staged almost 30 events in one day. The biggest space, the Great Hall, housed the CWL's Digital Economy research strand's London's Digital Ecologies of Collaboration installation, an exhibition that answered to five critical areas of enquiry: Digital Transnationalism, Democratisation and the Digital Space, Digital Heritage Commons, Active Digital Public(s) and Digital Tools of Innovation. It was the biggest piece that CWL exhibited on the day with showcasing about 20 projects CWL had supported.
Panel discussions and talks were kick started with a discussion of the four Hub directors/representatives, and included Interim Chief Executive of the AHRC, Andrew Thompson, chaired by NCUB's Director David Docherty. In this session CWL's film on the BOOST scheme was launched. In 20 minutes the film explores five examples of innovative and co-created research involving arts and humanities researchers and SMEs in the creative economy. In the panel discussion the four KE Hubs all identified the importance of networks within the creative economy and showed how their work had enabled and sustained these. The Directors also stressed that linear models of knowledge exchange or innovation did not capture the collaborative ways in which knowledge was generated or new products developed within the projects they had supported. The Hubs described how they had achieved significant culture change within their research partners, but it remained challenging for large research institutions to work with small companies on relatively small project in a timely fashion. &amp;nbsp;Finally, the international impacts of the work of the Hubs had been very significant and there was scope to develop this further in the years ahead.
Other panels and talks included discussions around evaluation, IP, commercialisation and women in the digital economy.
CWL's awardees came up with lots of ideas to enrich the programme. Furtherfield in collaboration with CWL's Post-doctoral Researcher Mariza Dima led a video-game-building workshop, fanShen's Dan Barnard explored with participants identity and how this influences our behaviour in a practical workshop, and Designerblock's Piers Roberts encouraged to explore new strategies in collaboration in a hack-it session. Rob Sherman and Kate Ryder showed their musical talents in two performances that demonstrated outcomes of the Entrepreneur-in-Residence projects, so did Tony White and Black Metics' Nick Makoha and poets who did a number of spoken words performances.
The Place Work Knowledge research strand rounded up its research on creative hubs in a panel session that was kick-started with a film about the most current research findings on the challenges of running a creative start-up and a creative workspace in London. The panel then discussed the future of creative workspaces in London.
The Digital Economy strand staged a Long Table conversation by employing QMUL's Lois Weaver's Long Table method, and discussed Digital Heritage Commons which highlighted issues related to the impact of digital technologies in reconfiguring the nature of the archive.
The Audiences research strand devised a participatory working session where research was shared about audiences for London museums during the last eighteen months. The aim was then to develop with participants an Audience Research Strategy for London's Museums for 2016 and beyond.
It was noticeable that the festival attracted creatives and researchers that had not yet been engaged in the hub which had been the intention. The festival also provided further support to SMEs and entrepreneurs with investors available in one-to-one sessions after the panel 'From Academic Collaboration to Commercialisation'. This panel explored how commercial ambitions of the SME partner can be achieved after the completion of an university-SME collaboration.
The Festival closed with a reception in the Great Hall where visitors could stroll around the digital exhibition and do further networking.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5899a8ffa3e0f9.52771455</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.creativeworkslondon.org.uk/festival/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>A Design Strategy for Multisensory Experiences in Urban Ethnographic Research</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A48BE1BF-E21A-4F24-87E9-4FCC8D47AD02</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A workshop on HCI part of CHI 2016 Conference, San Jose, California</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56defb83b33c04.84999921</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Huffington Post 'Fiction Is My First Language, So Why Not Use It to Talk About Art?'</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9D0C311D-2B21-47E1-AB6F-56591A6CC7B1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Article by Creativeworks London supported writer Tony White regarding his new short story.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e16292d66113.89713919</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/tony-white/fiction-is-my-first-language_b_4879123.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Huffington Post Tech 'Do You Think Before You Text?'</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F9B43D44-DD4F-4082-8238-19F2D4BA6B64</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Article from Huffington Post Tech detailing CWL funded project: 'InBox - A Transmedia storytelling project, exploring the stories hidden in our phone memories and hard drives'</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e16391b1dc89.78855793</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/victoria-mapplebeck/texting-and-communication_b_5253217.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Research Reports: Institutional Power, Creative Human Capital and Community Engagement Lie at Heart of Creative Partnerships</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>208A1EE2-E97B-459D-8AAF-2CFA664F4F17</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Widening the Register' features articles, reports and updates from Creativeworks London's people, partners, awardees, and wider community.

This very successful day was designed to scrutinize the hub concept. The term 'hub' is everywhere. Specifically, 'creative hubs' seem to be a global phenomenon. Starting in and around 2003, the growth and proliferation of these types of urban organisational manifestations has been exponential. From San Francisco to London to Moscow to Durban to Hanoi to Shanghai, creative hubs are on the rise. This being said, the work on creative hubs is surprisingly scarce. Although the term is currently in wide use in policy circles its actual meaning is not always clear. The term has no commonly accepted definition and has been criticized for lacking clarity as well as being 'all encompassing'. This day was aimed at getting to the heart of the hubs debate.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56ded9af35c048.40430803</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.knowledgelondon.net/index.php/2015/11/12/coming-to-terms-with-creative-hubs-a-symposium/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>What is the future of entrepreneurship in the performance and creative arts (Guildhall School of Music and Drama, London)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>18BB22C4-0FB8-4BEC-A217-7AD9579A88DF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This event explored the future, challenges and opportunities of entrepreneurship in the creative arts.

Based on his extensive research into contemporary media-related behaviour, Professor Ian Christie questioned received wisdom about audience and consumer interaction in relation to film in all its forms. He also examined how drawing on ideas and methods from other areas of the Creative and Cultural Industries, including new and emerging fields can help to reinvigorate a long established media.

The talk was followed by an open discussion chaired by Professor John Sloboda FBA.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56def71207b656.36433209</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Imperica 'Heidi Hinder: money futures'</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>270FD360-07D2-40D2-B8E5-AA63EFCADBFF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Interview with Heidi Hinder from Imperica regarding her Creativeworks London project 'Money No Object'.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e16a3ead5f74.12309799</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.imperica.com/en/in-conversation-with/heidi-hinder-money-futures</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop at Transmediale 15 (Berlin)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1FDD7095-1ED0-48A2-9415-CE402B16FB15</gtr:id><gtr:impact>50 professionals attended the workshop with very lively discussions, hands-on activities and a growing interest in the topic which was about thinking of how to approach a process of 'commoning the networks' to co-create and share knowledge, as a form of resistance against the neoliberal understanding of productive labour.

Exhibiting as part of the AHRC Common Ground event on 21 June 2016 was a welcome opportunity to bring parts of the installation (half of it) to York University. The Common Ground event was to bring together funded project by AHRC that showed innovative ways of collaborative research, and to come together on a common ground - to share ideas and visions for the future of arts and humanities research.

King's College London, London. June 23-24th, 2014. According to the literature, university-industry collaborations are far from straightforward. This paper adds to this work by looking at how the process of collaboration has fared between higher education institutions (HEIs) and small, medium and micro-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the creative and cultural industries (CCI). It does this by looking at the preliminary findings of Creativeworks London's (CWL) Creative Voucher Scheme. The findings emerged from an analysis of application data, ex post project final reports and interview data. The results to date show that: first, past experience in university - industry collaborations is tremendously beneficial to the success of the collaboration ; second, the creative industries engages with a number of different actors that speak different collaborative languages, actors are needed that are able to communicate at multiple levels at once; third, the collaborative process is not simply a dualistic one between university and industry but multi-layered involving a number of knowledge brokers in different positions in-between and at the interstices of these organizational structures; fourth, administrative expediency with regards to implementing these voucher schemes varies from university to university which point to potentially large departmental differences that can affect the intended collaborations; and fifth, there needs to be a managing of expectations and a balancing of different incentives when it comes to negotiating the outcome of these collaborations since university and industry move at different speeds and value different things.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dedb7f683c44.72162659</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.creative-campus.org.uk/final-conference.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The Social Art Map</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>64CE085A-72E8-4E8F-BEDA-7073793328F6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Social Art Map acts as a starting point and resource for people interested in social art practice, including those engaged in producing, commissioning, curating, collaborating and participating.

Over a six-month period the research partnership between Emily Druiff (Peckham Platform) and Sophie Hope (Birkbeck, University of London) supported by funding from&amp;nbsp;Creativeworks London, mapped the commissioning processes of social artworks across five different organisations in London including: AIR, CREATE London, Chisenhale, Peckham Platform and The Showroom.

Through over 130 collaborative projects (including those supported as a result of CWL's partnership in London Creative and Digital Fusion) the business needs of SMEs and creative entrepreneurs have been supported by researchers from CWL's 2l partner research institutions.

CWL has significantly increased the number of small and micro creative businesses working with research institutions in London, and has now received follow-on funding from the AHRC to work on creative hubs internationally. CWL researchers have also recently published a book with contributions from funded SMEs and researchers detailing the nature of co-created research and its implication for business models within the creative economy. Funded collaborations have generated a wide range of assets, including new products and services, new business models, new software and app development, enhanced democratic capacity for local communities in London, regeneration of communities. and health benefits. 420 distinct outputs were achieved through CWL's funded schemes, consisting of marketable products, prototypes, apps, new business processes, publications, digital tools, visual outputs, performances, workshops, exhibitions and other public events.

Research into the digital economy, London's audience, and the cultural geography of innovation in London has been developed in partnership with SMEs in the creative economy, and shared through Research Labs, conferences, workshops, films, a blog, and scholarly publications, Working Papers and digital materials. Those contributing to research dissemination evens also included policymakers, funders, and local authority officers working on local regeneration projects.

CWL received follow-on-on funding for impact and engagement for work on creative hubs in Sao Paulo, undertaken in partnership with the State Government of Sao Paulo. 2016-17.

In early 2017, Creativeworks London researchers (Shiach, Pratt, Virani) have been invited to contribute to workshops run by BEIS, and by Nesta, related to the development of the Industrial Strategy.

Pratt and Viran are co-authors of 'Creative Hubs, Understanding the New Economy', a Report on creative hubs across the UK, commissioned by the British Council to promote growth in the creative economy internationally. Shiach and Virani were also invited to lead workshops at a British Council/FCO organised conference in Chile, on 'Strengthening the Innovation Systems of the Pacific Alliance: putting higher education at the heart of successful innovation policy and practice', March 2017.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>4786E8FE-706B-4586-B041-9451EAD2A9D4</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d71abe832f23.68028575</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Key findings from this grant are: SMEs across the creative economy gain clear and significant benefits from undertaking collaborative research with arts and humanities researchers; arts and humanities researchers can enhance the scope and impact of their research through such collaborations, and the processes of curating knowledge exchange with the creative economy depend on a range of expertise, sustainable networks, and funding models that are light touch and well-timed.
