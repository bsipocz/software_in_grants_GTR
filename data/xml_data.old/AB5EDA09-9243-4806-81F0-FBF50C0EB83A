i) We will use supercomputer simulations to examine the evolution of the solar wind - the
stream of charged particles that is constantly flowing from the Sun into our solar system.
In particular, we will examine why this wind develops turbulence as it flows through interplanetary
space, and how this turbulence heats the solar wind.
ii) We will use supercomputer simulations to examine the low density but very high temperature
gas that lies above the Sun's surface - the solar corona. In particular, we want to understand how
magnetic field lines change their topology and release energy into the surrounding plasma by the 
process known as reconnection.
iii) We will analyse images from the Cassini spacecraft that is currently orbiting Saturn, to 
examine how Saturn's moons interact with and disturb Saturn's system of rings. We are 
particularly interested in the F ring which lies near the outer edge of the ring system, and is 
regularly disturbed by two satellites, Prometheus and Pandora. We are also interested
in the A-ring, which appears to form long-lived clumps or moon-lets that are able to migrate
through the system. Finally, using accurate images of the Saturnian satellites, we will track their
motion and measure the rate at which tidal energy is dissipated within Saturn.
iv) We will attempt to understand more about the formation of the planet Mars. It is believed
that the four inner planets of our solar system formed from collisions between smaller bodies
that built the planets, and we will use computer simulations to examine this process. We will
examine whether a collision can explain why Mars has a crust that is thicker in the southern 
hemisphere than in the north, and we will examine the formation of the satellites of Mars.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research proposed in this application is largely concerned with basic 
scientific inquiry, and so in general it will not have high potential for
immediate economic or real world impact. The primary impact of the research
will be in the cultural sphere, as the research will increase the sum total of
human knowledge about the solar system and its constituents, and will therefore
enhance the sense of wonder about the world that we live in for the general public.
Our research in areas such as the Saturn system, space weather, and the origin of 
the terrestrial planets in the Solar System all have strong public appeal and interest.

The Astronomy Unit has an active programme of public engagement and
schools outreach, both to inform and engage the general public about our 
research, and to also inspire school pupils to become interested in science
and to take STEM subjects post-GCSE. These engagement programmes
include giving public talks, having open days and evenings at the university
(e.g. Stargazing Live! events etc), and a range of media work that includes
TV and radio interviews. Our schools outreach programmes include summer schools,
essay writing competitions (i.e. Cassini Scientist for a Day), going into schools
to give talks and provide hands-on activities. In doing this we are explicitly supporting
the STEM agenda through our research, which is a key government policy for building
long term economic growth. 

A new initiative involves a collaboration with the Royal Observatory Greenwich. As part of
our collaboration on satellite astrometry with the IMCCE group at the Paris Observatory we
intend to facilitate the digital scanning of plates from the Royal Greenwich Observatory
archive, owned by the STFC and stored at an annexe of the Bodleian Library in Swindon.
Plates from the late 19th and early 20th centuries will be scanned at a newly-built facility
in Paris and used with data from the GAIA catalogue to improve our knowledge of the
long-term behaviour of satellite orbits and hence planetary interiors. This research is of
interest to the ROG because of the educational opportunities it brings. A Letter of Support
from the Dr Kevin Fewster (Director of the Royal Museums Greenwich) is included as an
attachment.

Our proposed programme of research includes work on the solar wind and the energetics
of the solar corona, and this research relates directly to Space Weather. As such, there
may be real world applications of this research in predicting coronal mass ejections and
their impacts on human activities such as satellite protection, human spaceflight etc. This 
is a motivating factor in pursuing this research, and the Astronomy Unit will be alert to any 
opportunities for finding real world applications of this research.

Other areas of our research that may have applications outside of the academic sphere 
include high performance computing and the development of advanced computer codes 
and algorithms, and in advanced techniques in data analysis. Again, we will be alert to any
opportunities that may arise in finding real world or commercial applications of this work.

Finally, the posdoctoral staff that we will employ on the grant will receive training and
experience in a variety of skills that will be of great benefit to the wider economy if
they at some stage leave academia and work in industry or the commercial sector.
These skills include advanced computing and data analysis, independent problem
solving, project management, report writing through authorship of scientific 
publications, and presentation skills obtained from conference attendance etc.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>762624</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>485D5EE1-0225-4C76-8254-FA9A555AE4A5</gtr:id><gtr:title>An in situ Comparison of Electron Acceleration at Collisionless Shocks under Differing Upstream Magnetic Field Orientations</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Astrophysical Journal</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c37017a17fa3368c3de1fb339e8f88a7"><gtr:id>c37017a17fa3368c3de1fb339e8f88a7</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Masters A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a9d1cbd30d983.71404318</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A933D237-C2B2-4765-A196-E59D9B32E4DA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Comparison of linear modes in kinetic plasma models</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Plasma Physics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/759b6d50efec70130af39f67cc502943"><gtr:id>759b6d50efec70130af39f67cc502943</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Camporeale E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a9d1c6e2ed2d2.40476183</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>60173C0D-F8FF-4BA9-A41F-62F0C4CA82E2</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Caviar software package for the astrometric reduction of Cassini ISS images: description and examples</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/0b0b7a3236d7ee2898c787cf054c0734"><gtr:id>0b0b7a3236d7ee2898c787cf054c0734</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cooper N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a9bc105721c96.25362938</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E8DBCCC7-FE75-425E-A9EC-31618B141DBD</gtr:id><gtr:title>MMS Observations and Hybrid Simulations of Surface Ripples at a Marginally Quasi-Parallel Shock</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a9ddf0ba90e4577fe60162f805cf4fb4"><gtr:id>a9ddf0ba90e4577fe60162f805cf4fb4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gingell I</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fc0d7550f21.32526852</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/P000622/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>9435F5F7-C9CB-4102-B9E4-7184EF1877DB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Planetary science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>CC54D2C6-621F-4715-96B2-C951ECBAF1C4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Solar &amp; terrestrial physics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F51E8679-B6B1-4619-B2EB-BC85BEE996B1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Non-Terrestrial Planetary Sci.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>158FC7A6-6652-4271-9D78-11BEE91FADDD</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Solar Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
