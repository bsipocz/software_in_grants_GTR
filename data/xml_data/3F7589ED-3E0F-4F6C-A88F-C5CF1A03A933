Many research studies have suggested that there is a strong genetic basis for MAE and up to two-third of family members may have seizures or abnormal brainwave patterns. However, the actual cause of MAE is unknown. Recent developments in genetics suggests that features in a person's genetic code called copy number variants (CNV) play an important role in brain disorders including epilepsy. In addition, using new technologies (next generation sequencing or NGS) we are now able to read massive amounts of genetic code quickly and NGS has led to successful elucidation of several rare genetic disorders. The aim of my project is to train in and use advanced genetics techniques in order to further understand the genetic basis of MAE. 

First, I will carefully examine children and family members for subtle symptoms of abnormal brain function. This will involve detailed history and examination, developmental, learning and behavioural assessment and brainwave (EEG) studies. Second, I will perform molecular genetic analysis on blood samples from children with MAE to look for CNVs. Third, I will perform whole exome sequencing (detailed search of the genetic code) of a selected family with three affected members to try and identify specific genes responsible for the disease.

This research is important as it will greatly increase knowledge about the nature and cause of this condition. I will be able to accurately describe the nature of learning and behavioural problems in children with MAE. This will lead to improved awareness of and early intervention for these children. I will also identify particular brainwave (EEG) patterns in family members that can be used in future genetic studies. In the medium to long term the discovery of CNVs will allow doctors to give accurate genetic counselling on recurrence and reproductive choices. I may identify causative genes that could then be screened in larger cohorts and may lead to a diagnostic test. Genetic testing is a cost effective and less distressing means of diagnosis compared to conventional workup. Identifying a genetic cause will also open new lines of research for new treatments.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Aims:
(1) Collect and deeply phenotype 20 MAE cases and record EEG in family members.
 - test the hypothesis that EEG abnormalities aggregate in family members and are raised compared to population prevalence.
 - accurately describe the neurodevelopmental phenotype of MAE.
(2) Assess DNA samples from 96 MAE cases for copy number variants (CNVs).
 - test the hypothesis that recurrent CNVs are over represented in MAE.
(3) Whole exome sequencing of a unique multiplex MAE pedigree.
 - test the hypothesis that a single genomic variant segregates with affectedness.

Methodology:
(1) Ascertainment and deep phenotyping: Twenty cases will be ascertained through clinician network. Informed consent will be obtained. The phenotyping protocol for cases will be: seizure and family history, speech and language, cognitive and neuropsychiatric profiling for autistic, attention and hyperactivity traits. 1st degree relatives will have resting and sleep EEG performed. All cases will have blood taken for DNA and RNA studies, cells and proteins.
(2) CNVs: I shall use DNA samples from ascertained cases plus samples from international collaborators. Projected sample size (n = 96). DNA will be genotyped on a whole genome CNV focussed SNP platform (Illumina HumanOmniExpress-12). Individual allele data will be run through two algorithms (PennCNV and QuantiSNP) and called if detected on both. 
(3) I shall perform whole exome sequencing on 3 affected members in a pedigree. I shall use NGS facilities (Illumina HiScan) at the MRC SGDP, aiming for minimum 30-40-x read dept and &amp;gt;85% coverage. I shall filter novel variants using (i) bioinformatic tools (ii) comparing the three affected relatives. Candidate variants will then be tested for segregation in the pedigree.

The description of neurodevelopmental problems will lead to improved awareness. Discovery of causative CNVs and/or genetic mutations can lead to more accurate diagnostic testing and genetic counselling.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research can directly benefit patients and their families.

In the short term, increased awareness of learning and behavioural problems in these children will lead to early intervention, the provision of educational support and statementing if necessary and behavioural and psychological support for patients and family members.

In the medium to long term, the identification of causative genes or mutations can lead to diagnostic testing. For example Dr Steve Abbs (GSTS), in conjunction with my supervisor Professor Pal are in the process of creating a next generation sequencing diagnostic panel for early onset epilepsies, this will screen patients for several epilepsy syndromes and genetic diseases with a single blood test.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>251485</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>55317833-D27D-4573-868C-371140C3E00D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Defining the phenotypic spectrum of SLC6A1 mutations.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Epilepsia</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7b7b94ba013b21343d711725b7e50511"><gtr:id>7b7b94ba013b21343d711725b7e50511</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Johannesen KM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0013-9580</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5aaa442573fbf3.03347546</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8CA3084A-BCDA-4429-BB75-9AD084063D37</gtr:id><gtr:title>New SMARCA2 mutation in a patient with Nicolaides-Baraitser syndrome and myoclonic astatic epilepsy.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>American journal of medical genetics.
