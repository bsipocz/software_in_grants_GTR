Smart Governance of Sustainable Cities (SmartGov)</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/N011473/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The SmartGov research project assesses the value of ICTs for engaging citizens in the governance of sustainable cities. The societal objective is to present the acquired insights in the form of a research-based knowledge system for government officials, which can be utilised to enhance sustainable urban goverance and service delivery. This knowledge is in dire need, since the alignment of ICTs and strategies for urban governance is a key challenge for cities: new technologies such as social media and open data promise 'smart governance' - if/when the technologies are integrated in strategies for citizen participation. Examples are abound: the City of Amsterdam uses Citizen Toolkits to engage citizens in environmental monitoring, the Greater London Authority uses open data to stimulate sustainability initiatives and Porto Alegre gathers information from residents to stimulate a dialogue about urban development. These new technologies are 'in vogue' but little is known about their effectiveness - and the drawbacks - in different organizational, institutional and political contexts. To assess the effectiveness, the research incorporates three main empirical research case studies which form a comparative analyses of smart governance in infrastructure, economy and poverty in Utrecht, Curitiba and Glasgow. The project elicits the mechanisms of smart governance, identifies the conditions that matter and assesses its contributions to (economic, democratic, social and environmental) sustainability. A novel theoretical perspective at the interface of e-governance and urban governance studies is developed to realize this aim and innovative research methods such as virtual ethnography are used. This project is carried out in close collaboration with officials from the Cities of Utrecht, Curitiba and Glasgow to ensure its value for policy-makers, practitioners and citizens.

The term 'Smart governance' refers to the use of new technologies, such as social media, the Internet, open data, citizen sensors, and 'serious' gaming, to strengthen the collaboration between citizens and urban governments (Hoon Lee, Phaal &amp;amp; Lee, 2013). In this research 'smart governance' is defined as aligning technological potential with urban governance strategies to form a consistent socio-technical approach to tackling urban problems (cf. Meijer &amp;amp; Thaens, 2010). The promise of smart governance is to create collaborative innovations for sustainable urban development.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project has direct impact with practitioners and policy-makers involved in the development of Smart Cities. Ito also engages citizens/service users directly.

The research will be conducted in close collaboration with local governments in the three cities through the following established contacts:
Drs. H. Sakkers Head of department of public affairs, city marketing, international and subsidy affairs,City of Utrecht
Ms C P.R.M. Miranda,Secretary of Information and Technology, Municipality of Curitiba
Ms Clare Holland, Public Relations Officer, Future City Glasgow, City of Glasgow

The aim of this research is to help government officials:
- Identify the situations in which smart governance has a chance of success
- Develop context-sensitive smart governance approaches for the selected situations

The direct beneficiaries of the research are local governments in Utrecht, Curitiba and Glasgow and other stakeholders in these cities (interest groups, media). The local government officials have frequent contacts with local research coordinators and virtual meetings with the research teams. Citizens of these cities will be involved in the project through a virtual citizen summit.

The impact will be broader as government officials from other cities will be engaged through the interactive internet platform and a final conference. Findings from the project will be communicated through the website and practitioners will be actively informed and invited to provide input and feedback to the research findings through the website. In addition, the project will contribute to the professional education of public managers since knowledge will be shared in (under)graduate courses in the Netherlands, Brazil and the UK, e.g. through teaching cases.

The research project will result in a research-based knowledge system for engaging citizens with ICTs to enhance urban sustainability. This system will focus on content-specific mechanisms by presenting insights in the form of contextual practices that provide interesting insights (i.e. rich cases). The guidelines, considerations and cases will be presented in the form of a knowledge system - possibly a wiki - to ensure easy use and to facilitate adding new knowledge, insights and practices to this 'living' knowledge system. The wiki will be maintained by the community of researchers and smart governance professionals that is formed in this research project.

Communication and dissemination (beyond academia)
Valorisation through local partners. The Cities of Utrecht, Curitiba and Glasgow are directly involved in the research project and they are informed directly about findings.
- Coproduction of knowledge. The local partners will actively participate in the design of the knowledge system (WP4): this coproduction of this knowledge system strengthens knowledge utilization
- Virtual conferences. The project consists of annual virtual conferences between the researchers and local administrators to facilitate the exchange of knowledge and experiences

Dissemination to other practitioners, public communication and dialogue (beyond academia)
- Interactive Internet Platform. This platform is set up to present the findings of the research project and to facilitate discussions about the findings and their implications. 
- A newsletter will 'push' the content of the website to practitioners and citizens
- National conferences. The results of the research will be communicated to other cities through a national conference in each country
- Virtual citizen summit. In May 2019, a virtual citizen summit will engage citizens in the 3 cities
- Knowledge system. The research project will result in a knowledge system that provides access to insights, examples, contextual guidelines and considerations about smart governance. The system will be maintained by the community of smart governance professionals and researchers involved in the project</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-08-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-08-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>278009</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>City of Utrecht</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:description>SmartGov practitioner partner</gtr:description><gtr:id>D18922D1-444C-447F-8F50-8882490DE17F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>n/a</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56deca6daf9397.92721376-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Practitioner knowldge and experience.

Each of the partners delivered presentations on (1) the results of the collective approach adopted by the three research teams to undertaking a systematic literature review; (2) proposals for undertaking detailed case study analyses of individual projects involving citizens using ICTs to engage in Smart sustainable governance, and (3) proposals for future collaborative and comparative research, which will see the exchange of Junior Researchers attached to the project to each of the partner institutions and case study cities. Various site visits were organised within the city of Utrecht to experience projects involving citizen-led engagement in Smart sustainable governance. Organised visits to the municipalities of Rotterdam and Utrecht involved presentations from the municipality officials on their approaches to and challenges with delivering the Smart city agenda.

Ethical review processes are different in the Netherlands and Brazil compared to the requirements of higher education institutions in the United Kingdom relating to the conduct of empirical research. However, the project partners were keen to view how this subject had been approached by the University of Stirling, and they are considering their response to the issues raised. The second expected impact is in the design of a bespoke protocol which will be implemented in the event that personal information is inadvertently accessed. This protocol will ensure that an immediate stop will take place to any research involving a particular dataset or database which contains personal information, and that no further research will take place, or any findings, outcomes or publications will be generated from the particular database or dataset until such time as the data owner and the SmartGov Prinicpal Investigator are satisfied that the information contained therein has been anonymised to their satisfaction.</gtr:impact><gtr:licensed>No</gtr:licensed><gtr:outcomeId>58c164df602cd6.81888903</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:protection>Protection not required</gtr:protection><gtr:title>SmartGov research project Ethical Review submission.</gtr:title><gtr:yearProtectionGranted>2016</gtr:yearProtectionGranted></gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput><gtr:description>A Data Management Plan was completed in September 2016 by the University of Stirling project team members and was then shared with the other two partners (Utrecht University, the Netherlands, and Fundacao Getulio Vargas, Brazil) to discuss and agree respective responsibilities for how information will be secured, managed and curated, shared, re-used, and common responses to issues of consent and anonymisation, copyright and intellectual property.</gtr:description><gtr:grantRef>ES/N011473/1</gtr:grantRef><gtr:id>F10AA442-4A33-4BD2-B64D-DD488271B270</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The SmartGov research project Data Management Plan was created by the University of Stirling research team using DMPOnline software, and is being used as a model of good practice for (1) the SmartGov research project partners, and (2) other research projects at the University of Stirling, overseen by the Libraries and Information Services staff.

Involves academic and practitioner input. The objective of the case study protocol is to present a document which can be used in all of the cases for the SmartGov project in the UK, Brazil and the Netherlands whilst at the same time allowing for subtleties in local and national contexts. The protocol derives from the SmartGov literature review and is designed to guide the empirical case study research. The aim of each case study should be: ? To collect research data that can be used for an international cross case comparison. The aim of this format is to ensure the comparability of the various case studies. This will be challenging since the cases may be quite different in scope, timing, scale, etc. Agreement on key issues will help to realise a certain level of comparability that is needed for a systematic case comparison, whilst at the same time allowing for subtleties in local and national contexts. ? To highlight the specific dynamics of that case. Highlighting the specific dynamics of the case is important since each case will provide insights in the value of certain approaches. Certain cases, for example, provide insights in the dynamics of citizen-initiated initiatives while others focus on government initiatives. This means that this case study format will need to be adapted for each case study.</gtr:description><gtr:id>848E8F99-E727-41E7-8D34-AB6A99DA442D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The case study protocol has be used to select a number of case study initiatives in the three countries. Semi-structured interviews start in 2016. Innovative practices combining new technology and citizen participation. The intention here is to research and understand more about the application and use of innovative technologies and practices. ? Variation in governance approaches. We want to explore how different smart governance approaches work out. For this reason, we will explore diverse cases that vary in governance approach such as government versus citizen-initiated approaches. ? Variation in contextual conditions. In addition, we want to explore a variation in context. This variation comes from selection of cases in the three different countries and also in different policy domains.
