Emerging research has established that significant changes in travel behaviour are often associated with life transitions. Life transitions involve a change in personal circumstances often marked by observable life events such as joining the labour force, moving home, having children or retiring. This research project sets out to explore the relationship between such life events (like moving home) and travel behaviour changes (like the number of cars owned or commute mode choice).&lt;br />&lt;br />The project will use data from the Understanding Society survey and British Household Panel Survey (BHPS). Together, these surveys have tracked the lives of a nationally (UK) representative sample of individuals over multiple years. They have recorded information concerning household car ownership and commuting behaviour, as well as a variety of other information about people?s lives such as their relationships, employment and health. Accordingly, the survey data offers a unique opportunity to examine how individuals make changes to their travel behaviours over time in relation to life events. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We envisage a number of outputs and have identified how to maximize the impact of the study in policy circles as detailed in the Pathways to Impact section.

First will be the involvement of Ben Savage from DfT and other relevant policy makers at all stages of the research process. He will chair a project Advisory Group made up of members of the project team and representatives from transport practice and academia. This will enable a close link with wider research, policy and practice throughout the research process and enable the results of the research to be quickly disseminated to relevant audiences. The DfT is excited by the prospect of this study as it feeds directly into their key policy concerns. We will also engage with the Living with Environmental Change cross-council research programme and invite a member of their Directorate to join the Advisory Group to maximise research links between ESRC and other research council investments.

There will be a focussed two day training event at the Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER), University of Essex, for DfT researchers, PhD students and other policy researchers interested in using Understanding Society for transport related research. This will use a data set derived from Understanding Society and prepared for use by transport analysts which forms one of the outputs from the research. We will consult with DfT to ensure the course is tailored to meet their requirements. The course will take place at ISER towards the end of the project.

As part of the capacity building aspect of the research programme, UWE researchers will be hosted at ISER for a research visit to familiarise themselves with the data and gain from interactions with researchers conducting longitudinal analysis at ISER.

Other outputs will include a full report for DfT on the inter-relationship between life transitions and travel behavior. Alongside this we will produce a series of short summary policy briefing documents designed for policy makers. We will organize at least one policy briefing meeting in London and disseminate the research findings widely to relevant government departments and other interested policy makers. UWE will manage a website for the project, including a researcher forum, and will draw on their existing networks in academic and policy circles to promote the findings from the research. ISER will contribute communications support for media and other activities and disseminate findings from the research through the ISER website and through regular e-bulletins and other reports which ISER circulates to the user community and policy circles. ISER's Communications Manager will work closely with the Understanding Society communications team at the ESRC to ensure the study has maximum impact.

Finally, we will aim to produce at least two academic journal papers and present the research at appropriate academic conferences.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>152690</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>End of project research seminar at Department for Transport</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BC757729-D7FF-4356-B21A-BF3B6F235076</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Seminar presentations sparked questions and discussion

The project website (http://travelbehaviour.com/) has been used to disseminate the outputs from the project (evidence summaries, slide packs, presentations, papers) and to provide regular updates on events and news related to the project.
An end of project policy briefing was held at the Department for Transport (DfT) on 16 June 2014 where project findings were presented to about 30 DfT staff. See write-up at http://travelbehaviour.com/2014/10/10/reflections-on-our-end-of-project-seminar/. In addition, two evidence summaries and two slide packs have been co-produced with DfT. See http://travelbehaviour.com/project-outputs/. Both of these are aimed for use by DfT but are also relevant to other policy makers. 

DfT referred to our project findings on pages 66-68 of its report ' Understanding the drivers of road travel: current trends in and factors behind roads use' published in January 2015. It uses our findings to explain the recent trend of lower car use among young people. The DfT report has informed its forecasts of future travel demand and its development of policies.

We have been actively working with partners in the West of England (with whom we have collaborative arrangements) to generate practical actions based on the research findings. The West of England local authorities asked us to run a workshop in September 2014, presenting our findings and facilitating discussion of how they can be used to shape their behavioural change programmes. See http://travelbehaviour.com/2014/11/14/working-with-practitioners-to-identify-policy-implications/#more-478. Ideas generated at the workshop have been incorporated into their Local Sustainable Transport Fund programme for 2015/16 (funded by DfT) which includes intervention measures under the theme of 'Transitions' aimed at children changing schools, youth entering employment and adults changing jobs and moving homes. South Gloucestershire Council commissioned us in February 2015 to produce an evidence briefing on 'Moving home as an opportunity for travel behaviour change'. This has been used as the basis for specifying a behavioural change intervention project aimed at home movers.

The outcomes of the collaboration with the West of England local authorities (on the role of life transitions in travel behaviour change programmes) have been disseminated to other transport authorities/organisations via a presentation at the UK Smarter Travel Conference on 6 February 2015.

A two-day data training event 'Understanding Society for Transport Analysis: A hands-on workshop using Stata' took place at University of Essex on 28-29 April 2014. The event was attended by eight staff from the Department for Transport (DfT) as well as other employees in the transport industry. The training event has expanded the capacity of policy analysts in transport to use longitudinal data for generating evidence. Data from the project has been deposited with the UK Data Service for use under special licence. The data links DfT accessibility indicators 2009 (as used in the project) to UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS).

The UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS), otherwise known as Understanding Society, offered a previously unavailable opportunity to investigate this for a large, representative sample of the UK population. A bespoke data set was produced for the project, derived from the first two waves of UKHLS for 2009/10 and 2010/11. The information available from UKHLS was supplemented by spatial variables which were derived from other secondary data sources and linked to UKHLS data. The project has obtained results on the factors that predict changes in household car ownership and changes in commuting mode using multiple regression modelling.
Across the sample of 19,545 households in England included in our analysis, 18% changed car ownership level - 9% of households gained at least one car, while 9% lost at least one car. The analysis of car ownership has separately identified the predictors of different types of car ownership level change (zero to one car, one to two cars and vice versa) and demonstrated that these are quite different in nature. Changes to composition of households (adults and children arriving and leaving) and to driving licence availability are the strongest predictors of car ownership level changes, followed by employment status and income changes. Households were found to be more likely to relinquish cars in association with an income reduction than they were to acquire cars in association with an income gain. This may be attributed to the economic recession of the time. The effect of childbirth differs according to car ownership state with it increasing the probability of acquiring a car for non-car owners and increasing the probability of relinquishing a car for two car owners. Sensitivity to spatial context is demonstrated by poorer access to public transport predicting higher probability of a non-car owning household acquiring a car and vica versa. This suggests good public transport provision to jobs can restrain demand for car ownership.
20% of the sample of residents of England employed both in 2009/10 and 2010/11 (N=15,200) changed commuting mode between waves with car commuting more stable than non-car commuting. Changes in commute mode are found to be most strongly predicted by changes in distance to work which occur in association with moving home and changing jobs. The distance relationship is asymmetric with increases in distance being far more likely to prompt switches to car commuting than reductions in distance are to prompt switches to non-car commuting. The job change and move home life events are also found to have an effect in their own right, indicating that people reconsider commuting behaviours at these times. Land use plays a mediating role with home moves to mixed land uses found to encourage walking and cycling to work, while moves to areas with shorter journey times to employment by public transport are found to encourage non-car commuting. 
A follow up grant application 'Commuting and Wellbeing', which builds on the research findings and extends them to look at how commuting behaviour influences wellbeing over time, was submitted to ESRC Secondary Data Analysis Initiative Phase 3 and was awarded funding. The project (ES/N012429/1) commenced on 1 February 2016.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The partnership with DfT and involvement of a project advisor from local government has enabled project findings to be produced in a form amenable to use by transport policy makers and practitioners (e.g. evidence summaries and slide pack). This can be expected to lead to better informed policy that assists with achieving transport objectives (e.g. reduced congestion) which will benefit the economy and society in general.
The project findings support the notion that there is high potential for behavioural change to occur if targeting is made of people experiencing life events and indicates which population groups and contextual conditions are candidiates for targeting. This knowledge can be used to inform the approaches used in transport behavioural change programmes. We are actively working with partners in the West of England (with whom we have collaborative arrangements) to generate practical actions based on the research findings. A half-day workshop will take place on 11 September 2014 with practitioners from the West of England Local Sustainable Transport Fund delivery team to identify how the research findings can be used to shape current and future programmes. We will disseminate the outcomes of this collaboration to other transport authorities/organisations via national practitioner conferences . 
The partnership with DfT in the project (including two-day training event) has increased the capacity of DfT to use longitudinal data in policy analysis and this can be expected to lead to better informed policy which will benefit the economy and society in general.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>534E5C5C-F238-4707-A241-3CE56054D8EA</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54649d6ad0e8d4.84512934</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Environment,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://travelbehaviour.com/lttb-project-summary/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Research cited in 'Understanding the drivers of road travel: current trends in and factors behind roads use'</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A900AD98-422D-49D5-BF39-4DCD28BF182E</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56ddfd0a9f9c70.19222436</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/understanding-the-drivers-of-road-travel-current-trends-in-and-factors-behind-roads-use</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The Understanding Society: Waves 1-3, 2009-2012: Special Licence Access, Geographical Accessibility (UKHLS-accessibility) dataset is the output of a research project that linked information from the Department for Transport's (DfT) Accessibility Statistics with information from the first three waves of Understanding Society.
