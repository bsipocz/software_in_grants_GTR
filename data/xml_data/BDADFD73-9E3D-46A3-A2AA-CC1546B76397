It will generate teaching-ready datasets based on &amp;quot;Understanding Society&amp;quot; (the ESRC investment in household panel data). It will also create associated digital resources that will be available for other students to use. It will increase the amount of work using secondary data at the undergraduate level and underline the relevance of research methods to the study of social sciences.&lt;br />&lt;br />A programme of new courses is planned, taking undergraduate students from their first year through to their final year. This new approach will provide a solid foundation for employability and future careers using quantitative skills (whether in the public sector, in academia, or elsewhere).&lt;br />&lt;br />This work is based on a collaboration between the Department of Political Science and International Studies (including sociology) and the School of Social Policy. It is expected to run from March 2012 until February 2014. Staff changes mean the project is now led from the University of Lincoln,&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>First and foremost, the main beneficiaries will be the UG students receiving the new teaching programme. This will enhance their confidence and skills in conducting empirical research using secondary data analysis. It will also have benefits in terms of their understanding of the advancement of knowledge within the social sciences. This will have very positive benefits if they go on to further academic research. Their confidence in handling numeric information is also likely to have positive outcomes in terms of their employability as it may help to make them more attractive to some employers. 

Those employing these graduates will also gain from having staff with confidence in handling numeric data.

Some researchers may also find it beneficial to conduct initial analyses on a teaching version of &amp;quot;Understanding Society&amp;quot; before tackling the main datasets.

Others working in the field of teaching research methods may gain from the insights from this project, which we would disseminate through relevant conferences and papers.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>40229</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>This was a project about the teaching of quantitative methods to students studying social science, and means of making that teaching more effective. As such, our impact aims were to adapt and improve teaching of relevant quantitative methods, beyond the main project. In term, such more effective teaching, and the provision of a number of key research tools, should equip social science students to take forward their analytical skills into future roles, whether in research or the wider workplace.

At the University of Nottingham, politics department, relevant quantitative training has been moved to the first year, enabling some students to take advanced training in the second year as an option. They are also working towards embedding the training around substantive topics. These are approved means of communicating the importance and relevance of quantitative methods within politics

At Lincoln, the materials are used at postgraduate level to provide hands-on quantitative skills to those seeking careers in social research.

The online databases are available to academic and policy researchers through the UK Data Service, and we are seeking to monitor how often these resources are accessed and used by relevant teachers and student researchers.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>0E40888F-5F4D-482F-8202-09AFBE93C57F</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56df0157c4d063.56086876</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>This study contains script files to create teaching versions of Understanding Society: Waves 1-3, the new UK household panel survey.

Sorted at UK Data Service under id SN 851405.
The aim was to make easier to handle datasets from Understanding Society, building a core of common variables from the first three waves but including some other wave-specific information from each wave. The richness of the data, including the combination of ratio/interval data as well as categorical/ordinal data, makes for an effective dataset from which to teach quantitative methods of all kinds. A distinctive feature is the provision of datasets in native R format in addition to those in a statistical format (Stata).</gtr:description><gtr:id>301DA3C8-7BB4-40E4-98F8-6B341C3BF864</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Is used in teaching undergrad and postgrad students, using real data, in a number of institutions.

This study contains data drawn from a second year undergraduate population undertaking Political Science and International Relations degrees at the University of Birmingham in 2012/13. This is a follow-on to the pilot previously run with first year undergraduates and deposited on this dataverse. The survey used was an updated version of the Cruise, Cash and Bolton (1985) Statistical Anxiety Rating Scale survey and administered for the purpose of gaining a more in-depth knowledge of the reluctance and fear surrounding the inclusion of applied statistics courses within their degree programmes. This survey formed part of an ESRC funded curriculum innovation project entitled &amp;quot;Understanding Society Through Secondary Data Analysis: Quantitative Methods over the Undergraduate Life Course&amp;quot;.</gtr:description><gtr:id>9437B874-D74C-4D7C-9403-95080BAD3568</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Used in subsequent teaching to map out statistical anxiety among students, and methods for attitudinal data.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d85b10d91c07.87453315</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Harvard dataverse materials #2 - An Application of the Statistical Anxiety Rating Scale Survey.</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/26175</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Advice to other academics on using secondary data for teaching purposes.
