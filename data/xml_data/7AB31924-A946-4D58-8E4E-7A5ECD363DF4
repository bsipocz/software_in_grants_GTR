Study)</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/L002663/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>The need to keep Britain's ageing population economically active has prompted government policies to extend working lives. However, such work may not be feasible for those with major health problems and, depending on occupational and personal circumstances, might be either good or bad for health. Information on the factors that influence work participation at older ages can be used to optimise government and employer policies, to identify interventions to help older workers, and to improve the design of work for older people.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This study will involve 6,000 people aged 50-64 years from 24 general practices across England. Practices contribute to the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), a research database maintained by a government agency, which logs all medical consultations, diagnoses, referrals, and treatments in 6 per cent of the population. CPRD linkage thus allows access to a rich objective seam of health information at low marginal cost.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Participants will complete questionnaires about their work and home circumstances, initially over 3-year follow-up. With consent, we will access their health data via the CPRD and link this to questionnaire responses.&amp;nbsp;The inter-relation of changes in employment (with reasons) and changes in health (eg major new illnesses, new treatments, mortality) will be examined statistically.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The main beneficiaries of the research will be policy makers within government, patients (workers), employers, occupational health &amp;amp; safety (OHS) professionals, other clinicians and researchers. 

In common with other Western nations, the British government needs individuals to work on and retire later. This need arises from lack of funds to support the state pension and other welfare benefits and the growing dependency ratio as the population ages - where possible, individuals need to be self-supporting for longer &amp;amp; continue contributing taxes for longer, rather than drawing welfare benefits. The need is driving official policies aimed at extending working lives (eg removal of the default retirement age, deferred eligibility to a state pension). At the same time, increasing numbers of people are intent on working longer, to build savings for retirement in the face of personal indebtedness, higher costs &amp;amp; taxes, and diminishing returns on savings and pensions. However:

i) The health consequences of such a policy require assessment, given the theoretical balance of benefits and risks, both in continued working and in early, normal and deferred retirement. Benefits and risks may be context specific, varying according to ways in which jobs are surrendered (eg voluntarily vs involuntarily) and surrounding personal circumstances (eg whether a person has enough retirement income for self-support and support of dependants; whether the work surrendered is seen as rewarding or distasteful, physically arduous or not; whether the individual has social support outside work etc). Retirement may bring health benefits of its own, which may be lost through extended working life.

ii) The scope to keep people with health problems in work, and its limits, are not well defined. Data on how health limits work participation at older ages are urgently needed. Data are needed also on effect modifiers of associations with work status in older workers with health problems so that measures that promote better participation can be encouraged and barriers to participation removed. 

iii) Potential interventions need to be identified. Part of the solution may lie in better medical care. However, interventions need not be medical but can relate, for example, to social policies and the organisation of work to support individuals with health problems. Similarly, barriers may be social, personal, financial or arising from want of good workplace support. (Thus, for example, the vocational outcome for a person with large joint disease could vary markedly between blue-collar and white-collar employment; within a blue-collar job, according to ergonomic aids, scope for job sharing and alternative duties; and between people according to other motivating/de-motivating factors, within and outwith work, as well as quality and type of health care.) 

Better understanding of these issues should help in refining public health &amp;amp; social policies. Assuming a continuing need for work at older ages, it can assist the design of better work for older people, identify the supports they need and help them to lay better plans for eventual retirement. 

Potential beneficiaries of the study include the national workforce, future generations of workers entering retirement, and employers, the goals being to optimise health outcomes related to employment and support for older workers. Employers and OHS teams will benefit from having an evidence base from which to make decisions on safety and fitness for work, and which informs the design of workplace adaptations to preserve work capacity.

The study has international relevance, given the age profiles of Western countries. However, findings will be of particular value to the cross-departmental Health, Work and Well-being government programme and its sponsors in the Department for Work &amp;amp; Pensions, the Department of Health, the HSE, the Scottish Executive the Welsh Assembly and the Northern Ireland Workplace Health Strateg</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-11-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-11-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>154038</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Imperial College London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp;

However, working beyond the traditional retirement age may not be feasible for those with major health problems, and depending on occupational and personal circumstances, might be either good or bad for health. To address these uncertainties, in 2013-2014, we recruited 8,134 adults aged 50-64 years from 24 British general practices contributing to the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). Participants have completed questionnaires about their work and home circumstances at baseline, and will do so regularly over follow-up, initially for a 5-year period. With their permission, we will access their primary care health records via the CPRD. The inter-relation of changes in employment (with reasons) and changes in health (e.g. major new illnesses, new treatments, mortality) will be examined. At present the baseline and first 2 follow-ups have been completed and the third is underway; response rates at follow-up are running at ~80%. However, the record linkage stage happened only in January 2017 and only the baseline data and year 1 follow-up data were cleaned and analysed or available for analysis by Feb 2017.

Most significant achievements from the award 
At baseline, the HEAF study provided descriptive information on employment patterns, working conditions and self-reported health in 50-64 year-olds across England, novel information on psychosocial aspects of work, people's feelings about their work and factors that could feature in retirement decision-making, and data on health-related job loss (HRJL). 

Some, 32% of 50-64 year-olds were not in work, 24% being fully retired. Adverse work conditions were fairly common. For example, among the 68% of people still in paid work, 37% reported being on their feet for &amp;gt;3 hours at a time, 24% still regularly undertook hard physical work that raised sweat and 16% still worked frequent shifts; adverse psychosocial conditions were also common - 1 in 3 people found their work colleagues to be difficult, 1 in 5 reported no choice over their work content and timetable, 1 in 5 perceived their job to be insecure, 1 in 7 often lay awake at night worrying about work, 1 in 10 rarely felt supported and 1 in 10 rarely felt appreciated by work colleagues. All of these undesirable work characteristics showed a gradient by social class, being worse among routine and manual occupations than in intermediate occupations, which were worse than higher managerial workers. One in 10 of respondents said they were finding it very difficult to manage financially these days, while 1 in 8 stated that they intended never to retire. Health problems were fairly common: 1 in 4 had borderline depression, 1 in 4 had fair or poor Self-rated Health (SRH), 1 in 5 to 1 in 7 had troublesome persistent bodily pain, while significant numbers reported impairments of function and senses, and also prolonged sickness absence and work limitations. 

Among those not in work at baseline, 1 in 3 reported leaving their last job for a health reason (HRJL), sometimes several reasons, and 1 in 12 of these people was receiving an ill-health pension. In almost half of such cases a musculoskeletal problem was cited as a contributory factor in job loss, in a third mental health problems, and in 1 in 7 a cardiorespiratory problem. As expected, unemployment and HRJL were more common in manual than in managerial occupations. 

All of the many self-reported health measures in the baseline HEAF questionnaire were strongly related to HRJL - for example, after allowing for age and sex, odds of HRJL were 16 times higher in those with difficulty in walking than in those without, 8.6 times higher in those with fair/poor SRH, and substantially higher in those with low mood, poor well-being, worsening memory, and persistent troublesome musculoskeletal pain. Recent HRJL was even more strongly related with such symptoms.

 The syndrome of &amp;quot;frailty&amp;quot; has previously only been studied in geriatric populations, where a score of markers developed by Fried et al predicts falls, hospitalisations, institutional care, dependency and mortality. Little is known about the prevalence of &amp;quot;frailty&amp;quot; in mid-life and whether it is a cause of employment difficulties. In all, 3.9% of 8,095 eligible respondents from the baseline analysis of HEAF were classed as &amp;quot;frail&amp;quot; and 31.6% as &amp;quot;pre-frail&amp;quot;. Three-quarters of the former were not in work, while 60% had left their last job on health grounds (odds ratio (OR) for HRJL, vs. non-frail subjects, 30.0 (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 23.0-39.2). Among those in work, ORs for prolonged sickness absence, cutting down substantially at work and struggling with work's physical demands were 10.7 (95%CI 6.5-17.7), 17.2 (95%CI 10.5-28.4) and 14.8 (95%CI 8.2-26.6) respectively. We calculated population attributable fractions (PAFs), representing the proportion of the population burden that is potentially preventable assuming that risk factors are causal and can be eliminated: the PAF for HRJL when any frailty marker was present was 51.8% and that for prolonged sickness absence was 32.5%. These findings suggest that frailty and its components could be important causes of HRJL at a population level. Associations were strongest with slow reported walking speed, with the possibility that motor function may be a major driver of the problem, and risk estimates were higher in manual workers than white-collar professionals, although frailty still had a major adverse impact on work capacity even in the latter group. With access to the CPRD data we plan to characterise the frail in our study in more detail. Analysis of the year 1 follow-up responses indicates however, that among those in work at baseline, frailty is also a strong predictor of job loss and HRJL over the following year (Hazard Ratio (HR) 7.8, 95%CI 4.3-14.2). We hope to conduct face to face assessments of physical function in a subset of HEAF subjects. A possible application would be to screen for frailty in workers using simple questions and office-based tests and then intervene to tackle related adverse employment outcomes. (Such an approach, based around exercises to improve balance and muscle strength and improve diet, has been used successfully to combat some of the adverse effects of frailty in the elderly.)

The baseline questionnaire also collected information on job dissatisfaction and its potential drivers, and on impaired sleep quality. Both of these outcomes have been linked with sickness absence, labour turnover and poor well-being. In HEAF, job dissatisfaction was more common among men, below age 60 years, in those living in London and the South East, in the more educated and in those working for larger employers. The main contributors to job dissatisfaction among employees were feeling unappreciated and/or lacking a sense of achievement (PAF 55%-56%), while in the self-employed, job insecurity was the leading contributor (PAF 79%). Job dissatisfaction was associated with all of the adverse health outcomes examined (odds ratios of 3-5), as were most of the negative perceptions of work that contributed to overall dissatisfaction. We concluded that employment policies aimed at improving job satisfaction in older workers should focus particularly on relationships in the workplace, fairness, job security and instilling a sense of achievement. If older workers are to be retained in the job market for longer, such measures will increasingly become necessary to implement.

Previous studies on insomnia have rarely focussed on older workers, among whom the occupational causes of sleep disturbance may vary from younger colleagues. One of the few such investigations, of French utility workers (the Gazel Study) reported improved sleep quality after planned normal retirement. As demographic trends in developed countries are now requiring people to work longer rather than retire, research on avoidable occupational determinants of insomnia in older workers is pertinent and topical. Insomnia was reported by 18.8% of HEAF subjects, being commoner in women, current smokers, obese individuals, those living alone, and those in financial hardship, and less prevalent in the educated, those in South-East England, and those with friendships and leisure-time pursuits. Occupational risk factors included unemployment, shift working, lack of control and support at work, job insecurity, job dissatisfaction and several of its determinants (lacking a sense of achievement, feeling unappreciated, having difficult work colleagues, feeling unfairly criticised). Population burden of insomnia was associated particularly with difficulties in coping with work demands, job insecurity, difficult colleagues and lack of friendships at work (PAFs 15-33%). Insomnia was strongly associated with seven measures of poorer self-assessed health. We conclude that insomnia in mid-life may be caused or aggravated by several workplace elements that could be avoided through better employment practices.

Other analyses are at earlier stages. We have found, however, that high body mass index (BMI) is a weak risk factor for job loss, HRJL, absenteeism, and reduced work productivity; that chronic regional musculoskeletal pain is a stronger risk factor for these outcomes; and that risks of job loss are notably high if obesity and chronic lower limb pain coincide. Initial findings fed into a review for government led by Dame Carol Black. 

We have also found that HRJL had a 1-year incidence of 3.4% (95%CI 2.9-4.0%), the leading causes being mental (40%) and musculoskeletal (37%) ill-health. Some 6.3% (95%CI 5.6-7.0%) of HEAF respondents changed jobs over the first year of follow-up, while 4.3% (95%CI 3.5-5.2%) of those in their 50s and 60s took up a new job. Chronic regional pain was a strong predictor of incident HRJL (HRs 3.2 to 4.2, depending on anatomical site), while after allowing for other factors (age, sex, qualifications, personal finances, mental health), people with persistent back or neck pain were 60% less likely to find new work than others not in work at baseline. We have also found that frailty and chronic pain are very strongly associated; and early cross-sectional analyses suggest that those who have undergone planned normal retirement are less likely to report low mood, poor SRH, insomnia, and poor well-being than those still working after allowing for affluence and social class. (Indications from the Gazel study are that SRH may improve with retirement, especially if jobs that are left are perceived to be demanding and unrewarding; longitudinal analysis with further waves of data and prescribing information will explore these possibilities). 

To what extent were the award objectives met? If you can, briefly explain why any key objectives were not met
 The HEAF study is proceeding broadly to plan. Indeed it has surpassed expectations in its recruitment (a third higher at baseline, with better response rates than expected at follow-up and some 50% more people under follow-up at 3 years than planned). Such success has brought challenges in terms of extra resources and mailings have taken longer than expected to process. There has also been a substantial delay in obtaining data from the CPRD whose governance arrangements changed between outline agreement and the study's execution; the obstacles have only recently been overcome but they preclude us reporting here on outcomes and risk factors derived from medical records - an important future component of the cohort's work programme.

The objectives of the HEAF study were always long-term, requiring several waves of follow-up and the full power of analysis has not yet been brought to bear, but the materials have been collected. Objectives related to the descriptive epidemiology of work and health at older ages (e.g. patterns of job loss and employment difficulties with leading causes) have been met; those relating to modifiable risk factors for HRJL have been partially met by analyses to date, but with much more to come. A key question we have had, important for policy, is whether working longer is good or bad for health. While we have some simple cross-sectional analyses on this, we need several waves of the cohort data to look more critically at this question; moreover, we can look in more detail with linked CPRD data from individuals' medical records. (For example, a Finnish study found a fall in antidepressant use with normal retirement - we may have the wherewithal to consider analyses like this). 

How might the findings be taken forward and by whom?
As indicated above, there are many more findings to come. Collaborations have been proposed to develop a Scottish HEAF (SHEAF) study and an Australian one; a visiting Fellow from Amsterdam will work on the HEAF dataset in the summer; there are also data-sharing collaborations with colleagues from the University of Liverpool and internal and external PhD studentships at the planning stage.
