Collagen is the most abundant protein in the animal kingdom, where its molecules robustly self-associate into micron-sized fibrils of well defined morphologies. These fibrils form the structural basis of mammalian connective tissues and, as the major component of the extracellular matrix, are crucial for the determination of cell phenotype, cell adhesion, and tissue regulation and signalling. For the same reasons the process of collagen assembly is also at the centre of engineering efforts to design functional biomimetic materials and platforms for cell and tissue manipulation. However, the current understanding of the physical processes that drive collagen assembly from molecules to micron-sized fibrils, and the determinants of the resulting morphologies, is far from complete. 

The goals of this project are to bridge molecular and microscopic scales of the dynamic process of collagen assembly, and identify the physical principles of the assembly of collagen and collagen-mimetic molecules. This will be achieved by developing a minimal physical model of collagen-like molecules, implemented in a molecular dynamics framework. Because of its simplicity, such a physical model can reach experimentally relevant time- and length-scales of the assembly, and its results can be directly compared with experiments of our collaborators. Two specific objectives are to: 1) Map the design of small collagen-mimetic molecules on the resulting fibrillar architectures, and hierarchical pathways of fibril nucleation and growth. 2) Investigate the influence of the molecular charge patterns and hydrophobic interactions on the self-assembly of native collagen molecules. The long-term goals are to understand the physical principles behind robust collagen assembly in nature, as well as the roots of its failure in pathological processes, and to provide guidelines for the rational design of collagen-mimetic materials. The results from this project will give insights into the roots of collagen remodelling in diseases and ageing, and guide the design of collagen scaffolds for biotechnological applications.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Beneficiaries: Researchers in the field of physics of life. How the impact will be achieved: This project will bridge the molecular and macroscopic scales of collagen assembly, an important biological phenomenon, and will identify its physical principles.

Beneficiaries: Researchers engineering functional biological and biomimetic materials. How the impact will be achieved: By answering how the collagen molecular properties influence the morphologies of self-assembled collagen structures, the results of the project will provide instructions on how to rationally design collagen-based materials.

Beneficiaries: the Postdoctoral Research Associate (PDRA) and the students in the PI's group. How the impact will be achieved: The PI will train the PDRA in the fields of soft matter, biophysics, and computer simulations via regular meetings and discussions. The PDRA will also receive training in scientific communication and collaboration through the regular interactions with the collaborators. The PDRA will be immersed in the vibrant interdisciplinary environment at UCL, and encouraged to participate in the abundant scientific events at UCL and IPLS. The PDRA will pass on their skills to new students in the group.

Beneficiaries: Undergraduate students. How the impact will be achieved: The PI will provide hands-on training in computer simulations of biological and biomaterials assembly in form of short research projects to final-year, rotation, summer, and ERASMUS students.

Beneficiaries: Future employers of the PDRA and the students trained in this project. How the impact will be achieved: the PDRA and the students will gain training in communication and presentation skills, methods of collaborative work, creativity, critical and quantitative thinking, and problem-solving abilities. These skills are highly sought after in many professions beyond academia, including technology industries, finance, government, and education sectors.

Beneficiaries: Academic and industry researchers in the UK and World-wide. How the impact will be achieved: The results of the project will be available free of charge in the form of a publication preprints on the arXiv repository, and open-source publications will be favoured.The implementation of the computer model developed in this project will be available on the PI's group webpage, and online repository GitHub, and the links to the model will be provided in the related manuscripts, press-releases, and on the PI's webpage. The PI and PDRA will present at major national an international scientific meetings, where delegates from biotechnological, pharmaceutical, and polymer industries are regularly present.

Beneficiaries: Companies with interest in collagen assembly and misassembly. How the impact will be achieved: the PI will present at showcase days when representatives of companies are invited to the Faculty of Mathematical &amp;amp; Physical Sciences at UCL. The UCL Innovation and Enterprise Office will help the PI to establish the contact with relevant companies in the future, when enough results are collected to enable translation into an environment outside of academic research.

Beneficiaries: General Audience. How the impact will be achieved: Members of the general public will have the opportunity to be engaged in the results of the project via: the approachable layman summary of our results published online and in the media; artistic illustrations of our results; attending the UCL lunch hour public lecture held by the PI; and/or by joining in informal discussions in UCL's &amp;quot;Cafe Scientifique&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Pint at the Interface&amp;quot; events. Interested high-school students will also be able to discuss research with the PI in detail at the International Summer School of Science that the PI regularly contributes to.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100772</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R011818/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F442B6BE-8B89-4C01-8D3B-E8A4D320B672</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biomolecules &amp; biochemistry</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>02FE9751-1497-4DFD-B349-D4A9C96538E1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biophysics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
