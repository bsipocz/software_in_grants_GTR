This has several advantages over solution-based methods for studying molecular interactions: high solubility is not required, so the range of solvent and functional group combinations that can be studied is greatly expanded; weak interactions that are difficult to detect in solution can be quantified; the system can be coupled to robotic sample handling equipment, so that experiments can be run in an automated high throughput format to generate huge amounts of data rapidly.

Two approaches will be investigated: prediction of the intrinsic interaction parameters for functional groups based on calculations on isolated molecules; prediction of interaction energies based on calculations on intermolecular complexes. The data generated in the experimental part of the programme will be used to identify the most promising computational methods, and these will then be refined, guided by the experiments.The ability to make quantitative predictions of solvent effects will have a significant impact in many fields of science and technology, where interactions between molecules are the all important determinants of structure, properties and selectivity.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>488678</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Most chemistry of practical utility and all of biology takes place in solution, yet our fundamental understanding of the role of solvent in these processes remains at a rudimentary level.

The aim of this proposal was to explore the full implications of the model, both experimentally and computationally, to establish methods for making quantitative predictions of solvent effects.
The experimental part of the programme explored a variety of new high throughput methods for measuring interactions between functional groups in a wide range of different solvents: a chromatographic (hplc) chemical double mutant cycle was used to characterise interactions of molecules in solution with H-bond donors and acceptors anchored to a solid support: an automated NMR titration experiment was used to study the H-bond properties of solvents that are conventionally regarded as non-polar; an automated UV-Visible titration experiment was used to examine the effects of solvent on the interactions between a carefully selected set of probe complexes. These experiments have shed new light on the factors that govern intermolecular interactions in solution and crucially the role played by the solvent environment. A major new development is the exploitation of robotic sample handling equipment which means that the experiments can now be run in an automated high throughput format to generate huge amounts of data rapidly.
These experimental data have provided key insights that we have used to refine the basic solvation model discussed above. In the computational part of the programme, we have developed reliable ab initio methods to calculate intrinsic interaction parameters for functional groups based on the properties of isolated molecules and extended this to provide a complete description of the entire surface of the molecule. This has allowed us to develop models for molecular solvation shell and hence make predictions about phase transfer properties like solubility that are of fundamental practical significance eg in the pharmaceutical industry. In addition, the experiments on mixed solvents have shown how these potentially complex systems can be handled in a surprisingly straightforward manner computationally. The ability to make quantitative predictions of solvent effects will have a significant impact in many fields of science and technology, where interactions between molecules are the all important determinants of structure, properties and selectivity.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The ability to make quantitative predictions of solvent effects will have a significant impact in many fields of science and technology, where interactions between molecules are the all important determinants of structure, properties and selectivity.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>AEEEAD6D-B9B6-4C58-B9CC-FAE8B9AB50E7</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545cec0f39fe17.43276728</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C3358684-8A8E-4F22-BB69-F36DA0402336</gtr:id><gtr:title>Chemical double mutant cycles for the quantification of cooperativity in H-bonded complexes.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of the American Chemical Society</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f0e846647b967ac5484f9f03e854bfb8"><gtr:id>f0e846647b967ac5484f9f03e854bfb8</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Camara-Campos A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0002-7863</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d01801840dd3ce</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>47B07EC9-A9A0-41F4-88C9-5AF3782B5D47</gtr:id><gtr:title>Cooperativity in multiply H-bonded complexes.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Chemical communications (Cambridge, England)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b266354adf886db9ae09f0ae059c1fe4"><gtr:id>b266354adf886db9ae09f0ae059c1fe4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hunter CA</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1359-7345</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d02b02bbd55168</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0FA068CF-3CB6-455E-B70E-6D668CF8A45D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Non-covalent interactions between iodo-perfluorocarbons and hydrogen bond acceptors.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Chemical communications (Cambridge, England)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8410ef25a104707d1da18a53d06d3201"><gtr:id>8410ef25a104707d1da18a53d06d3201</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cabot R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1359-7345</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d02b02b68498c8</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AAB272E7-77A4-4BD8-A560-F4B402E13193</gtr:id><gtr:title>Preferential solvation and hydrogen bonding in mixed solvents.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f3b556ab0731fd3369d5b89ed7a70369"><gtr:id>f3b556ab0731fd3369d5b89ed7a70369</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cook JL</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2008-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1433-7851</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cfc0fc0d842f30</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0FF46B12-E802-47ED-8F83-07C0497AE58D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Evidence for partially bound states in cooperative molecular recognition interfaces.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of the American Chemical Society</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d8a6b261c6bc6041e0da53a5100305a6"><gtr:id>d8a6b261c6bc6041e0da53a5100305a6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Chekmeneva E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2008-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0002-7863</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d017017e8659ff</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/C545842/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>666CC8F4-4525-49AF-91C1-5675E0C8ADDF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chem.
