1. Analyse real-life electrical load data collected by this Institute to provide representative models of demand that can guide
design, testing and implementation of the demand side management system (known as Demand Shaper) to be deployed in
a field trial under this project. This will be performed near the start of the project to inform the design process.
2. Perform an agent based simulation of the Demand Shaper technology when deployed on a commercial scale, using data
obtained from the trial project. From this simulation a report will be produced assessing the likely effectiveness at scale
and any risks and issues that further investigation. This will be performed towards the end of the project to support the
overall conclusions drawn.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The two academic work packages proposed here are essential to the overall programme for this project. If the project is
funded and executed successfully, it will provide a flagship demonstration of the potential for community energy as
envisaged the Department of Energy and Climate Change's Community Energy Strategy. The Demand Shaper technology
that will be demonstrated also has potential for national impact as recognised by its success in the Nesta Dynamic Demand
competition.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>25369</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation at Energy Systems Catapult workshop - Delivering a Flexible Future through Innovation</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1B9CF9D7-0B5C-47B6-AE83-88A1CFD7FEEA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The workshop was a one-day event on 28 September 2016 that was jointly delivered by Innovate UK, BEIS, Energy Systems Catapult and KTN. 

The purpose of the workshop was to allow the companies and researchers working on energy system flexibility challenges and opportunities to present their work, network with each other and an external audience, as well as discuss smart systems with BEIS and Ofgem through a workshop actvitiy

Representatives of projects were allowed to pitch their existing projects and ideas for future funding, using just three minutes each.

The experience of operating a localised energy scheme as piloted on the project has informed follow on projects for Energy Local (the lead partner) at Bethesda in Wales and elsewhere. The BBC has featured the Bethesda project, which is based around a community owned hydro scheme, on BBC News and Moneybox. The management of demand shifting and communication of feedback to users was developed in the CEGADS project.

Dr Mary Gillie from the the lead partner Energy Local attended a Community Energy Round table organised by BEIS.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>F21E3AD4-BFF0-43AF-A453-8354CE05F6D2</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56bb66f17d7951.82747098</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Energy,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Domestic energy users who have high demand and are relatively poor (in this case residents involved in a trial of demand shifting who use electric storage heaters) are often very good at demand shifting in order to minimise their energy cost and may even 'beat the system', however most of them will benefit from an automated (i.e. smart) device that will shift demand in response to grid conditions on their behalf. The added complexity of a smart home energy management system is more than compensated by the added benefits it delivers providing that users are able to override the system when they wish.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Design of smart meters and HEMS devices
