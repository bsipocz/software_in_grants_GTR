All countries, including LICs are encouraged to adopt these new global standards. Members of the G20 have asked the Financial Stability Board, IMF and World Bank to study how global banking initiatives will impact developing and emerging economies, identifying this area as a key policy concern for promoting inclusive growth. To date the scant research on this question addresses almost exclusively emerging market economies. LIC governments and advisers have voiced an urgent need for LIC-specific analysis. 

This project will be amongst the very first to look at how political institutions and processes - at both the domestic and global levels - shape the impact of global banking initiatives on LICs and their ability to harness financial flows for inclusive growth. The core research questions are: 
(1) How much de facto flexibility do LICs have in respect of the new regulatory standards, how much do they need, and under what conditions (economic and political; global, regional and national) should they adopt new regulatory standards? 
(2) What strategies for influencing global standard-setting processes and institutions are likely to yield the best outcomes for LICs?

The project combines two disciplinary approaches: political science and economics. It combines quantitative and qualitative analysis, and will generate new datasets. Outputs will include top-quality peer-reviewed academic publications and a series of tailored policy briefs. 

The project has been designed to maximize impact through continuous direct engagement with policy-makers confronting the problems the research addresses. The design of the research questions has been undertaken in dialogue with LIC and developing country policy-makers. We will continue to engage policy-makers through semi-structured interviews; annual workshops; and through the project's Expert Advisory Board. The Board includes Vivienne Apopo (Director General, East African Development Bank), Mthuli Ncube (Chief Economist, African Development Bank), Amar Bhattacharya (Director, G24 Secretariat).

Key beneficiaries are regulators, senior government officials, and other stakeholders in LICs engaged with promoting inclusive, sustainable growth. This includes the Community of African Banking Supervisors (CABS); the Banking Commission of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU); the Regulatory Committee of the Central Bank of Angola; the National Financial Supervision Council (NFSC) of Vietnam; the Commercial Bank Supervision Department of the Bank of Laos; and the Central Banks of Tanzania and Uganda. Our impact strategy leverages existing close links between several of our researchers and key stakeholders in LICs. 

The project will enhance the capacity of LIC governments to make choices about financial regulation, and to ensure global standard-setting processes support these choices. It will also enhance the capacity of scholars and stakeholders in LICs to continue the research in-country: to this end we are working with in-country researchers on the case studies and engaging Southern stakeholders with targeted dissemination. We will engage directly with academic institutions in LICs, such as the Department of Economics, University of Dar es Salaam (Tanzania); the Departments of Economics and Law, University Ouaga II (Burkina Faso); the Economics and Management Faculty of Lom&amp;eacute; and Kara Universities (Togo); the Economics Department, Agostinho Neto University (Angola); the Fulbright School (Vietnam, a partnership between Harvard Kennedy School and University of Economics, Ho Chi Minh City).

The project will enjoy a ready exploitation route, building on the excellent track record and extensive network of the Global Economic Governance Programme (GEG) and the Blavatnik School of Government, University of Oxford.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project has been, and will continue to be, co-designed with beneficiaries in order to maximize impact at three levels: conceptual impact, through framing debates surrounding global banking initiatives and LICs; instrumental impact, through supporting the development of evidence-based policies for better financial regulation in LICs; and capacity-building impact, through engaging researchers and stakeholders in LICs throughout the process.

Well-functioning financial systems are fundamental to economic performance in LICs, and thus central to development and poverty alleviation. The members of the G20 have asked the FSB, IMF and World Bank to study how global banking initiatives will impact developing and emerging economies, identifying this area as a key policy concern for promoting inclusive growth (forewords to FSB 2012 and FSB, IMF &amp;amp; WB 2011 in the list of documents). Yet to date the scant research on this question addresses almost exclusively emerging market economies. This project will be amongst the very first to look specifically at how political institutions and processes - at both the domestic and global levels - shape the impact of global banking initiatives on LICs and their ability to harness financial flows for inclusive growth. 

Beneficiaries of this project include a wide variety of stakeholders engaged with supporting inclusive growth in LICs, such as: 

- Policymakers in LICs engaged in processes of financial regulation, including officials in central banks, finance ministries, and regional economic organisations. These include, amongst others, the newly-established Community of African Banking Supervisors (CABS); the Banking Commission of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU); the Regional Securities Exchange (BRVM) of WAEMU; the Regulatory Committee of the Central Bank of Angola; the National Unit of Processing Financial Information (CENTIF) of Togo; the National Financial Supervision Council (NFSC) of Vietnam; the Commercial Bank Supervision Department of the Bank of Laos; and the Central Bank of Tanzania.
- Global financial regulatory-setting bodies and economic institutions, including the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the Financial Stability Board (FSB), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank (WB) and the G20;
- Bilateral aid agencies seeking to support inclusive growth and fight poverty in LICs, including DFID; and
- Both Southern and Northern NGOs concerned with growth and development in LICs and specialized media working in this area.
Outcomes of this research will have local and global resonance. Locally, it will identify strategies for LIC officials designing and executing financial regulatory policies in-country, who will benefit from the increased understanding of both their local situation and the international comparative situation in their work developing effective evidence-based policy. Globally, it will provide valuable knowledge for international regulatory setting agencies and other international institutions on the impact of global banking standards on developing countries, and will support LICs in engaging in these global discussions. Furthermore, other stakeholders engaged in supporting inclusive growth in LICs - including bilateral aid agencies, NGOs and specialized media - will benefit from a richer understanding of the political economy of global banking initiatives in LICs, as this evidence base will allow them to more effectively carry out their projects.

Finally, the project will substantially contribute to capacity building through working directly with LIC-based researchers in the case studies and through engaging Southern research institutions, regional organisations, and government bodies. By building wide networks of both academic and non-academic stakeholders engaged with these issues - across both developed and developing countries - the project will ensure capacity building throughout its lifespan and beyond.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-03-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>521634</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Preliminary findings have been presented at the following conferences, engaging policymakers from developing countries and the international development community:

We have completed the statistical analysis of banking standards adoption in low-income countries in three articles. One has been accepted by the Journal of Financial Regulation, the other two are in early submission stages. We have developed an analytical framework that explains regulatory decisions in low-income countries as the consequence of two forces: international drivers and domestic obstacles to the adoption of global banking standards. The countries we study exhibit different combinations of these two forces. The analytical framework breaks down the general drivers of and obstacles to adoption into nine causal mechanisms, each formulated as a hypothesis. The statistical papers mentioned above test these hypotheses. Case studies authors are currently engaged in field research in eleven countries, guided by the same analytical framework.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This question will be answered at a later stage of the project.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>3E3E9B66-474B-4CF8-AF44-DF9F9D2F099C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56caf4fdd29c51.43966030</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.geg.ox.ac.uk/research/flagship</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>26FE4DF9-B3D6-4CD3-81E7-E8F69641B656</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Limits of Globalizing Basel Banking Standards</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Financial Regulation</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7e050bd6475c7c807ec5722cb9a2cc56"><gtr:id>7e050bd6475c7c807ec5722cb9a2cc56</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Jones E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a1efdc55f8e77.08371423</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/L012375/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7D4B9AE9-278F-4867-8D5E-31631698729E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BF887C15-B29F-4C4C-8420-88AF17A8FFE1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Financial economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E889DE6C-93D7-4BC9-92AA-7A4698F7D850</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Internat Political Economy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
