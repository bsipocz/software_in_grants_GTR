Eric Schmidt, Chairman of Google was flabbergasted that 'computer science isn't even taught as standard in UK schools. Your IT curriculum focuses on teaching how to use software, but gives no insight into how it's made.&amp;quot; As a result of this, and a series of studies and reports saying the same thing, the Government wants to ?transform the IT curriculum, moving away from computer literacy to developing software and programming skills,?
The Government's 'Behind the Screen' initiative is designed to develop a wholly new set of GCSEs and A levels. As experienced educators we have an idea of the kind of tools that will be needed to help young people learn to code. As experienced developers we have an insight into the technical challenges of the project. The Technology Strategy Board is supporting us to realise that vision.
HTML is the key gateway to full programming languages and is the language used to create the framework in which applications sit. HTML5 is being talked about as being even more significant, particularly in mobile and cross-platform applications. Without learning HTML, it is more difficult, and fairly useless, to learn Javascript and PHP. Learning HTML and CSS is not easy for beginners, but is often dismissed as such by experts.
Future Coders is a project that involves designing games that people would actively choose to play. There would be a focus on young people although these games would create the mental pathways necessary for anyone who wanted to learn HTML These will be 'Brain Training' games with the very practical outcomes of teaching the principles of HTML and CSS. Once skilled in these basic languages of the web, the gamers of the past can become the creators.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>18000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">700108</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
