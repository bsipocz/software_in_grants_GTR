It aims to investigate a new and highly efficient approach for the preparation of nitrogen-containing compounds that have three rings in a single step from precursors that have no rings. In addition it outlines research on the formation of single mirror image compounds by selective substitution of simple substrates called nitriles. The chemistry uses common reagents in organic chemistry (aldehydes and amines) yet will allow the rapid formation of complex structures containing multiple rings. The key step involves a ring formation followed directly by an internal cycloaddition. This will give rise to two new carbon/nitrogen and two new carbon/carbon bonds and three new rings in a single step.Five-membered nitrogen-containing rings are present as part of multi-ring compounds in many natural products and biologically active compounds. Our chemistry will provide in a single step such compounds with considerable complexity and will therefore be amenable to the efficient preparation of alkaloid ring systems. We plan to apply the methodology to the synthesis of the core ring in alkaloids such as stenine, vindoline, strychnine and novel daphniphyllum alkaloids.In addition we plan to study metallated nitriles. Nitriles are excellent functional groups in chemistry and it is easy to remove a proton next to the nitrile to give a negatively charged species. These species have been shown to have a unique nature, with localisatoin of the charge on the carbon and retention of triple bond character in the nitrile. This facet, combined with the small size of the nitrile group, makes metallated nitriles powerful reagents for synthesis. They react with many different electrophiles to give substituted products and are even amenable to preparing more hindered centres. Despite this, little research has been done on asymmetric substitutions of metallated nitriles. We have expertise in the area of single mirror image organolithium species and this proposal outlines the extension of this knowledge to metallated nitriles. Our experience in this area indicates that it is easier to control which face of the metallated carbon is attacked rather than using an unsubstituted nitrile and trying to control which face of the electrophile is attacked. The way that the selectivity is induced will be studied using a range of ligands and will be optimised. If we discover a ligand that gives high selectivity in this reaction, then the chemistry could rival other widely used chemistry (alkylation of enolates). In addition, nitriles can be converted to many different functional groups, so this methodology is likely to find wide application.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>129500</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project discovered that simple compounds called aldehydes could be treated with nitrogen-containing compounds called amines to promote a cascade of reactions (involving condensation, cyclization, then dipolar cycloaddition). The chemistry was successful for a variety of aldehydes and its primary benefit is that it allows rapid introduction of complexity, since it provides a way to prepare molecules with three rings all in one pot. This chemistry is therefore very efficient way to access complex molecules. In addition the chemistry was highly selective, typically providing only a single isomer of the products, which is very useful for controlling the outcome. 
The work has so far led to four publications in the primary scientific literature. These describe the use of different amines (hydrazines, hydroxylamine, amino-esters) and different aldehydes (alkyl and aromatic) for the formation of fused and bridged structures. Our first publication in this area was in the top ten most read articles in the journal Organic Letters in the first quarter of 2011. There are still some results that are unpublished, but another PhD student has added to these data and we intend to publish all these results together in the near future. Another area that we investigated in this award related to the formation of single mirror image compounds by selective substitution of simple substrates called nitriles. We prepared a metallated nitrile using an exchange reaction from a single mirror image group called a sulfoxide. However, the products formed after quenching the reaction did not maintain their absolute configuration. This work is currently unpublished however it has led to further research (with another researcher) and a new collaboration with a US academic and together we did some work that has led to a publication (Org. Lett. 2014, 16, 62-65). In addition, this area has inspired research that led to an EU Marie Curie grant and further publications (such as Chem. Sci. 2017, 8, 1436-1441).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Nitrogen-containing rings are present as part of multiple ring compounds in many natural products and biologically active compounds.
