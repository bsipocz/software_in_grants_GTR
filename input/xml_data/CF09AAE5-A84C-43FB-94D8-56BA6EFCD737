The site occupies a unique position in Minoan archaeology as it is the most fully excavated Bronze Age town on the island; it is also the largest that exists without a palace or any other kind of central building. While future research may yet reveal such a structure, at present the numerous town buildings in themselves provide considerable evidence for the economic, social and political activities of the inhabitants of this extensive Bronze Age town. This project will examine such evidence in detail, and publish it in the form of a substantial, amply illustrated book. It will provide important new information on the nature of urban development, shed light on the nature of inter-community relations in the east of the island in a key period of change, and situate Palaikastro in its wider Aegean and Mediterranean contexts.\n\nArchaeologists at Palaikastro have uncovered a number of town blocks, with excavation campaigns in 1902-06, 1962-63, 1986-96 and 2003. Block M was first named as such in 1902-06, but was only properly excavated in the 1990s. It is quite unique at Palaikastro because of its excellent preservation of remains dating to the Neopalatial period, c. 1750-1500 BC, which was the peak of settlement at the site. Unlike many of the town buildings, which are subsequently reoccupied in the three centuries that follow (1500-1200 BC), Block M sees almost no reoccupation. This means that the Neopalatial remains are in many cases undisturbed, and its main structure / Building 6 / is among the best preserved of this period anywhere on the site. Furthermore, Block M has also revealed significant traces of the preceding Protopalatial period (1950-1750 BC), which is also only patchily known at Palaikastro, and indeed across east Crete more generally. Therefore Block M has a great deal to tell us about these two key periods, which mark the emergence of the first palatial centres and state polities anywhere in Europe, their remarkable development and expansion, and ultimately their demise. \n\nWhen we look in more detail, this trajectory is nowhere better encapsulated than in Block M. Although much of the area is evidently occupied in the Protopalatial, it is only in the first phase of the Neopalatial period that a truly substantial building is erected. This structure / Building 6 / incorporates the only example known from Palaikastro of a 'Minoan Hall', an architectural feature much more commonly encountered in central Crete. The building then sees some modifications in the next ceramic phase, but is soon destroyed, seemingly by an earthquake. What is unusual is that the building is then never reconstructed, appearing to lie abandoned, with perhaps some sporadic use among the ruins; and this at what is commonly thought to be the acme of Minoan power. It is not long before the Theran eruption occurs (c.1600 BC), and there is speculation that a tsunami could have hit the site. However, Building 6 was already out of action, as we can judge by the accumulation of volcanic ashfall, 20cm deep in places, and some certainly water-borne, inside and outside Block M. In the next phase, the last before the ultimate collapse of the Minoan palace-states, Block M seems to be nothing more than an empty plot with an enclosure wall and two deep wells, probably sunk soon after the eruption in a quest for uncontaminated drinking water.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>25837</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/F004338/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Archaeology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>14AE809A-4116-46B5-ABF7-DF8BCE2BF069</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Prehistoric Archaeology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
