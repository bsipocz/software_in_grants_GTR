The addition of groups termed ubiquitin can modulate a range of processes including degradation, protein sorting, and immunity. Different ubiquitin modifications are recognized by a variety of ubiquitin receptors, which directly bind to the modified proteins and mediate the downstream effects. 
Like ubiquitin, ubiquitin-like molecules (UBLs) are attached to proteins using distinct enzymes. Most UBLs don?t target their substrates for degradation, but rather change their activity by, for example, providing a new binding surface for interaction partners.
Defects in ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like protein conjugation systems have been implicated in many human diseases, including cancer and neurodegeneration. The development of these diseases can be associated with a malfunction of many players in the ubiquitin pathway. 
My laboratory is interested in elucidating the molecular mechanisms that regulate how these chemical groups are attached, recognized and elicit functional downstream effects in normal cells, as well as in disease model systems.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Cullin-RING ligases are the largest class of E3 ubiquitin ligases termed CRLs (cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases) in the cell and involved in many different cellular processes. Modification by ubiquitin-like modification (UBLs) such as NEDDylation can impact CRLs by triggering structural changes and by counteracting the association of the CRL inhibitor Cand1. Despite many advances in our knowledge of UBL ligation machineries, it remains unclear how some UBLs are directed to targets. Through structure/function analyses, our lab has been working to identify mechanisms by which two E3s can function with a single E2 to promote optimal UBL modification of a target. 

The modification of the Cullin subunit with the ubiquitin-like modifier NEDD8 activates the E3 ligase activity. NEDD8 modification requires the action of DCN-type NEDD8 E3 ligases, which directly bind to the cullin and promote the transfer of NEDD8 onto a conserved lysine residue. Through our work on DCUN1D5 we discovered that phosphorylation of DCUN1D5 by IKKalpha does not directly alter the activity of DCUN1D5 as NEDD8 E3. We are now trying to understand if it instead alters the localization/interactions of the protein. Additionally, we have used knockdown approaches to validate that localization of DCUN1D5 to sites of DNA damage is involved in the resolution of DNA damage caused by UV, but not ionizing radiation. Understanding the different DCN-type NEDD8 E3s and how they differentially regulate cullins, may allow the development of specific inhibitors of cullin-subtypes in the future.

Recently, a Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase has also been implicated in the regulated reabsorption of salt in the kidney ? a process which regulates blood pressure. Patients with a hereditary form of high blood pressure (Gordon?s syndrome) carry mutations in either the cullin CUL3 or a substrate adaptor for CUL3, KLHL3. We?ve previously shown that the CUL3/KLHL3 complex directly ubiquitylates WNK kinases, leading to their degradation by the proteasome. This is critical as WNK kinases are activated by osmotic stress, which leads to downstream activation of the ion co-transporters and ultimately, salt reabsorption. 

Through our work, we have shown that KLHL3 directly binds to an 11 amino acid acidic stretch on WNKs and through structural studies, we were able to explain why the patient mutations disrupt the interaction of the two proteins. This has now revealed the binding mode of the WNK substrate to the complex, which would be critical in the development of a small molecule that inhibits the ubiquitylation of WNKs by preventing their binding to the E3 complex.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>267000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Global</gtr:country><gtr:description>DSTT renewal 2016</gtr:description><gtr:id>CF6DE066-337B-4604-ABE2-55DA7C33C279</gtr:id><gtr:impact>During the collaboration, the Unit has helped to launch and/or accelerate many drug discovery programmes, some of which have entered human clinical trials.

The MRC-PPU benefits in many ways as a result of the DSTT research collaboration.

1. It provides an obvious translational outlet to enable our PIs to exploit their research findings. For example, any PI within the MRC-PPU can rapidly let all six pharmaceutical companies know about any new potential exciting research finding that they have made or any drug target that they have identified or validated. This can lead to major collaborations and stimulate one or more of the pharmaceutical companies to initiate a new drug discovery programme.

2. The research support received from this collaboration is invested in the PPU PIs research programmes and provides additional support to several of our Unit's Scientific service teams including our protein production teams, antibody generation team and cloning team.

3. We obtain key reagents including novel inhibitors, genetically modified cell or mice models from our DSTT pharmaceutical company collaborators.

4. The pharmaceutical companies we collaborate with provide us with important knowledge on the most critical research issues of the day for their drug development programmes. This feedback and industry perspective is extremely useful and helps maximise our overall competitiveness. It ensures that the drug discovery research programmes of the PPU PIs are focussed on addressing the most important questions for better understanding and treating disease.

5. The DSTT collaboration greatly benefits our students and postdocs by providing experience in working with industry via their direct involvement in collaborative experiments with pharmaceutical companies. This provides them with a unique insight into the high quality cutting edge research that is taking place within pharmaceutical companies and gives them an awareness of potential careers in industry. This is particularly important given that one of our main priorities is to train tomorrow's industrial researchers and ensure that the future workforce has the high quality scientific and research support skills that the UK economy will be dependent on.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>All the Programme Leaders in the MRC Protein Phosphorylation Unit have participated in a major collaboration with the pharmaceutical industry since 1998, termed The Division of Signal Transduction Therapy.

GlaxoSmithKline have announced that their BRAF protein kinase inhibitor Dabrafenib (Tafinlar), has been approved by both the European Commission and the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma associated with the BRAF V600E mutation. Unresectable melanoma is that which cannot be removed by surgery, while metastatic melanoma is that which has spread to other parts of the body. The new drug was developed employing BRAF enzymes generated by researchers in the Division of Signal Transduction Therapy (DSTT) in the College of Life Sciences at Dundee.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d597e6d11038.18487738-2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Benefits from DSTT collaboration
The MRC-PPU benefits in many ways as a result of the DSTT research collaboration.

1. It provides an obvious translational outlet to enable our PIs to exploit their research findings. For example, any PI within the MRC-PPU can rapidly let all six pharmaceutical companies know about any new potential exciting research finding that they have made or any drug target that they have identified or validated. This can lead to major collaborations and stimulate one or more of the pharmaceutical companies to initiate a new drug discovery programme.

2. The research support received from this collaboration is invested in the PPU PIs research programmes and provides additional support to several of our Unit's Scientific service teams including our protein production teams, antibody generation team and cloning team.

3. We obtain key reagents including novel inhibitors, genetically modified cell or mice models from our DSTT pharmaceutical company collaborators.

4. The pharmaceutical companies we collaborate with provide us with important knowledge on the most critical research issues of the day for their drug development programmes. This feedback and industry perspective is extremely useful and helps maximise our overall competitiveness. It ensures that the drug discovery research programmes of the PPU PIs are focussed on addressing the most important questions for better understanding and treating disease.

5. The DSTT collaboration greatly benefits our students and postdocs by providing experience in working with industry via their direct involvement in collaborative experiments with pharmaceutical companies. This provides them with a unique insight into the high quality cutting edge research that is taking place within pharmaceutical companies and gives them an awareness of potential careers in industry. This is particularly important given that one of our main priorities is to train tomorrow's industrial researchers and ensure that the future workforce has the high quality scientific and research support skills that the UK economy will be dependent on.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>All the Programme Leaders in the MRC Protein Phosphorylation Unit have participated in a major collaboration with the pharmaceutical industry since 1998, termed The Division of Signal Transduction Therapy.
