Henri Brochet, an important figure in amateur Catholic theatre, having founded with Henri Gheon the Compagnons de Notre-Dame (1925), a journal for Catholic amateurs, Jeux, treteaux et personages {1930), and another troupe, the Compagnons de Jeux (1932, continued his activities until his death in 1952. During that time, he corresponded with major figures in Belgium, where the popularity of Catholic theatre in a country which had not separated churches and State was the envy of practitioners in France. Brochet also corresponded with individuals across the whole of eastern, northern and southern Europe, and some individuals in Canada, encouraging the dissemination and receiving news of Catholic theatre. His correspondents reveal their various preoccupations, both material and spiritual, in respect of their own activities. 
The Belgian correspondence includes letters from the well-known Belgian dramatist, Michel de Ghelderode, who devoted some time to the encouragement of amateurs. The project aims to develop an understanding of how an actively functioning milieu of exchange in the domain of Christian popular theatre in Belgium and France, and the rest of continental Europe, was constructed.

After 1945, Catholic theatre recommenced its activities. Among amateurs, Nos Spectacles resumed publication in 1946. ATOCEP, later the Federation catholique de theatre d'amateurs franyais (FeCTAF) played, along with its lay counterparts, an important national role in the organisation of amateur theatre generally, a domain highly regulated in French law. Although the dimension of Catholic witness through theatre in a constitutionally lay state remained very strong, the participation of many prominent Catholics in the resistance movement and the prominence of Christian-democratic politics meant that, the school question aside, the conditions of Catholic activity in French national life were less confrontationaL Andre Malraux was the honorary president of the committee which organised the 50 years of ATOCEP-FeCTAF {1960). However, Vatican II, discouraging emphasis on the reconquest of souls, marks the decline of Catholic theatrical activity, due also to developments within French society and culture, notably a diminution of religious conviction, along with the advent of television and alternative leisure activities. The last number of Nos Spectacles is January 1975. The project will investigate how ATOCEP-FeCTAF constructed an actively functioning milieu for amateurs according to a generally shared vision of the role of Catholic theatre in society and how it maintained an emphasis on a theatre of witness as well as participating in the management of amateur theatre.

Among professional actors, the Union catholique du theatre et de Ia musique {UCTM), founded by Gaston Baty and Georges LeRoy in 1927 as the Union catholique du theatre, was reconstituted in 1947 under the leadersh'ip of le pere Carre of the Dominican order. Its role was to foster the spirituality of Catholic actors and musicians in particular, and to provide them with a 'virtual' parish based at the Parisian church of Saint-Roch. In 1958, a journal was established, Les Quatre Saisons, and the UCTM, recognised as of 'utillte publique', thus attracting certain fiscal advantages, organised
Its own social work service for retired and indigent members of the profession, as well as providing a focus for a reflection on the work and life of performers. The project studies the construction and maintenance of this disparate and dispersed milieu.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-01-27</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>37506</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/E505767/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1AE825FC-C165-4D0F-B712-D5FA662046AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>French Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
