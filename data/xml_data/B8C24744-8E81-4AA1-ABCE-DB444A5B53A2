What choices did they have and what disadvantages did they face? What strategies did women use to engage with courts and court officials? How did these vary according to national boundaries, language, ethnic identity, confessional identity and class? And how did they change over time? This project seeks to provide substantive answers to these questions, utilising evidence from cases heard in England, Ireland, Wales and Scotland between 1100 and 1750. 

Although the history of women's lives in medieval and early modern Britain and Ireland has formed the subject of numerous studies, necessitating some discussion of the legal frameworks (particularly pertaining to marriage and property) within which they lived, the subject of women's engagement with the law, and experience of justice within the multiple courts and jurisdictions in the regions under scrutiny, has been rather less well researched. When studies appear, they are either narrowly-focused on specific topics or archives, and thus of limited value for assessing women's broader experiences, or claim to take a broader view but in fact base their conclusions on extrapolations from those same, limited case studies. In addition, English cases have dominated the field: if Irish, Welsh or Scottish materials have been explored at all, it has been on rigidly national lines, with little or no comparison or consideration of points of contact and similarity between women's strategies in different judicial environments.

The research team aims to produce a study that can act both as a guide to methodology - critiquing previous work, highlighting gaps in archival resources and studies, and establishing frameworks for applying gender to legal history - and as a conceptual, practical demonstration of the power of comparative history to illustrate underlying structural and ideological constraints on women's agency before the law. That is not to say that we shall be treating women in isolation: we are not 'unmooring' them from the gendered, familial and local contexts within which they lived their daily lives. How they identified themselves, and how they were recorded in court proceedings, reveals for example how using a father's name took on a particular importance over a woman's marital identification in many of the contexts under scrutiny.

The resources for this study will include both records from secular and church courts, and will encompass civil and criminal cases. Samples will range from the Anglo-Norman state (where Jewish women will be considered alongside Christians), the English colony in Ireland, local courts in Wales and the Welsh use of central courts, and women in the legal landscape of Scotland before and after Union. The period studied reflects a time of significant political change and social upheaval in British and Irish history, when the state's physical boundaries, administrative structures and religious identity were all shifting and evolving. The law in some sense provided some continuity through this period, but the complexity of jurisdictions, overlapping, competing, local and central, religious and secular, meant that similar courts in different regions might differ a great deal (for example, there is a marked lack of regulation of sexuality in Irish church courts compared with those in Scotland and England). 

We shall consider: the choice of court/s to which a case could be taken; whether male representation was required or requested; what languages were used by the courts and by the plaintiffs and defendants, and how these were recorded; whether women had to undertake lengthy journeys to attend; avenues of appeal; forms of petition; strategies (including absence) employed. True comparison can only be achieved by starting from the court user's perspective, seeking to understand her experience of the law, and applying a common set of questions to all of the samples.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Beneficiaries
Outside the academic community, the existence and activities of the research group will have major benefits for:
* the Women's History Network, whose membership is a mix of academics and non-academics, all interested in the histories of women, but whose activities tend to cluster in the period of modern history. The progress and completion of the proposed study will offer a different perspective on women's agency within the nascent state, as well as presenting some of the challenges of working in an earlier period;

* public events and initiatives linked to women's history, including celebrations of International Women's Day, Women's History Month, public outreach events in Dublin, public engagement events including a workshop about the project hosted in association with the Centre for Public History and the Centre for Gender History in Glasgow, and by the Centre for Medieval and Early Modern Research in Swansea;

* BBC and independent television and radio in Britain and Ireland, for whom the group's activities are likely to generate stories of public interest, particularly to women, and could form the basis of programming such as Women's Hour, In Our Time and The Long View.

Accessibility
The priority of the research group has to be the generation of a high-quality research projects, whose methodological frame and empirical findings can inform and shape future research into women's engagement with the law, and offer a substantial body of evidence from Britain and Ireland that can be compared with broader European and international cases. The group's activities, however, will include a workshop and symposium setting out the challenges of the project and exploring its eventual achievements and findings. Both events will be fully accessible to a non-academic audience, focusing on specific areas and topics of interest, These events will be open to commentary and feedback through social media feeds.

Impact Measures
Primarily, this project will have an impact on the practice of legal and gender history. But in disseminating its findings beyond academia, the research team hopes to engage the public in broader debates about women's experiences of the law (particularly those from other ethnic and cultural backgrounds engaging with current British and Irish legal systems), including how to shape it and make it more equitable for women. In particular, the project blog will make links with women's organisations in the UK and Ireland to continue the discussions beyond the academic outputs.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>702271</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Social media</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2BC0570C-2B41-4403-A382-1AE2804B4916</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The project has both a Twitter account and a website that promote project events and findings of the researchers.

The intention was to bring students, academics, librarians and members of the public together to increase the number and quality of articles on women on Wikipedia. Our findings created 6 new articles and the revision of 10 articles about notable Welsh, English and Irish medieval women. A report on the event can be found: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Whistlaw/Jan_28_Editathon and http://www.swansea.ac.uk/riah/research-projects/women-negotiating-the-boundaries-of-justice/. As a result of the event, Dr Youngs and Dr Booker were invited to write a blog for Wikimedia on the running of the editathon and on women in Wikipedia. This can be found here: https://blog.wikimedia.org.uk/2015/02/women-and-wikipedia-editathon-swansea/. This also formed the basis of a blog by Robin Owain of Wikimedia on the editathon, and we were subsequently approached by Jason Evans, Wikimedian in Residence at the National Library of Wales to collaborate on an editathon in October 2015, this time focusing on Welsh law: https://wikimedia.org.uk/wiki/Expert_outreach/Wikipedian_in_Residence_at_the_National_Library_of_Wales/Hywel_Dda_Edit-a-thon. During this session we created two new biographies of medieval women that generated considerable discussion on Wikipedia because they were nominated for deletion on the grounds they were not suitably notable. Following support from a number of Wikipedians, the two biographies of Hawise Lestrange and Nest Bloet were allowed to remain: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawise_Lestrange and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nest_bloet . This therefore demonstrated not only the gaps in female biographies on Wikipedia, but the resistance encountered when trying to redress the situation.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>60046141-9705-4799-BC69-D6677864D6AD</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56e0444aa125b9.57992357</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>These are very much interim findings, but we are reaching conclusions as follows:
* The extent of the ability of married women to go to the law and present their cases. This is not a new discovery in that current historiography is showing that married women had greater access to the law than previously assumed. However, by looking across several jurisdictions we are showing that married women had considerable latitude in bringing their cases to courts.
* That while there are local variations in women's capacity (or desire) to go to court, the records themselves are consistently showing a proportion of between 13-15% of cases involving female plaintiffs.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>There are opportunities for other researchers to build on the research, particularly PhD students.
