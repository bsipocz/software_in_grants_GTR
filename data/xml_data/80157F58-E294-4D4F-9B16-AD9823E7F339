These particles emitted by industrial sources such as power plants, diesel engines, cement kilns, food processing factories and by various domestic sources can penetrate deep into the human respiratory system and their effect on humans is not fully understood. Particles with sizes less than two-and half micrometers (PM2.5) are of particular concern, for example in 2009 the UK Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants reported that these particles are more closely related to effects of mortality than larger particle fractions. This fine particulate matter can remain airborne for long periods of time, which significantly increases the probability of their inhalation and the health risk they pose. As in industrialized countries people spend the majority of their time indoors, it is important to minimise air pollutant levels in such closed environments. The present proposal is focused on the development of an impulsive micro-electrostatic precipitation (IMP) technology for the removal of fine particles from air. This technology is based on the use of nanosecond impulse corona discharges and a background DC voltage for effective electrical charging and transportation of airborne PM2.5 particles. High voltage impulses will allow application of significantly higher voltages (which could be as high as several tens of thousands of volts) to the active, corona electrodes in order to generate ions through ionization and dissociation of the ambient gas. It is expected that higher ionic concentrations produced by impulsive energisation will provide more efficient electric charging of the PM2.5 particles and will result in improved removal efficiency. Also, the use of sub-microsecond high voltage impulses will help to avoid catastrophic spark breakdown (which is similar to miniature lighting) in the IMP electrode system, these sparks lead to the collapse of the electric field and result in reduction of the production of ions. Conventional electrostatic precipitation systems have a pronounced minimum in their efficiency for particles with dimensions between a few hundred nanometers and a few micrometers, and it is anticipated that IMP technology will provide improved removal efficiency of airborne particles with these sizes. It is planned that the compact IMP air cleaning systems can be used in hospitals, schools, offices and homes.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The successful development of the impulsive micro-electrostatic precipitation (IMP) technology will have a significant impact on air cleaning technology. Airborne fine particles pose a potential health risk, and this risk is exacerbated by the increasing use of nano-particle based technologies. Particles of size less than two-and-half micrometers (PM2.5) have recently started to attract attention as they can be carried long distances, can stay airborne for long periods of time and can penetrate deep into the lungs. As a result, manufacturers of air cleaning systems for domestic and commercial use are continuously looking for more effective methods to reduce the concentration of PM2.5 airborne particulate matter. The IMP technology has the potential to dramatically increase the efficiency of reduction of PM2.5 particles in air which are difficult to remove using conventional electrostatic precipitation methods. The major beneficiaries from the successful outcomes of this project will be air cleaning and purification industries and society in general. Progress in technological developments associated with the impulsive micro-electrostatic precipitation will provide a platform for the development of highly efficient and reliable air-cleaning systems which can be used in indoor and closed space environments where it is necessary to reduce concentrations of PM2.5 airborne particles to the lowest possible level. Typical applications of such impulsive micro-electrostatic precipitators can found in hospitals, schools, offices and homes, public transport and other places where people are present over long periods of time and where air quality is a high priority. It is known for example, that in industrialised countries people can spend more than 20 hours per day indoor. Therefore it is important to ensure the quality of indoor air and the IMP technology has the potential to fulfil this task. The proposed one-year research programme is focused on the development of the scientific and engineering basis for the impulsive micro-electrostatic precipitation technology, and it is planned to establish links with industrial companies which develop, produce and use air-cleaning systems. It is anticipated that after successful completion of this programme, the development of practical IMP systems will be continued in collaboration with the industrial partners. Depending upon the level of resources from industrial partners, it is anticipated that it could take 3-4 years to develop a demonstration IMP system. The research assistant employed on this project will be involved in research and development of the impulse micro-electrostatic precipitation technology for the effective control of fine airborne particles. It is anticipated that the research assistant will have a unique opportunity to develop practical skills in the field of pulsed power engineering, fine particle characterisation, and electrostatic precipitation. He/she will work with state of the art pulsed power systems, high voltage diagnostic systems and a particle spectrum analyser. Training and experience obtained during this project will improve the research skills of the researcher and will increase his/her employability. Several manufacturers of the air cleaning equipment have been contacted and they have expressed significant interest in the proposed IMP technology. It is planned to work in close collaboration with these companies which will allow for better understanding of the practical problems and tasks which could be addressed through the innovative development of the impulsive micro-electrostatic precipitation technology. It is planned to disseminate the results of this project through research publications and presentations at relevant scientific conferences and technological workshops.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-10-24</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-10-25</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>95292</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>33980</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>University of Strathclyde</gtr:description><gtr:end>2013-10-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>University of Strathclyde</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>Faculty of Engineering PhD Scholarship</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>B6D5401B-CE19-4FA9-9A09-3668AFEB17AA</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5ee369c85ee369dc</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-11-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Pollution of air with fine and ultra-fine particles is a major cause of concern as such particles pose a recognised health risk. There is an urgent need for new technologies that will be capable of reducing concentration of fine (particular matter with linear dimensions of less than 2.5 micrometers) and ultra-fine air-borne particles. 

The successful development of the impulsive micro-electrostatic precipitation (IMP) technology proposed in the present project will have a significant impact on the indoor air cleaning technology. Potential major beneficiaries from the outcomes of this project will be air cleaning industries and users of the micro-electrostatic precipitation systems as this technology has a potential to reduce significantly the concentration levels of PM2.5 particles in hospital wards, lecture theatres, houses and offices. This will contribute to improvements in quality of life and will especially benefit people with respiratory conditions. 
The present project will generate academic impact including experimental data on the transient behaviour of the sub-microsecond impulse corona discharges, theoretical analysis of transient charging of air-borne particles by corona discharges, optimal electrode topologies and energisation parameters for the IMP systems, experimental data on the efficiency of precipitation of different types of particles. It is expected that this scientific and engineering knowledge will benefit not only academics and engineers working in the field of air cleaning, but also researchers who are developing novel environmental and bio-medical applications of non-thermal plasmas including plasma cleaning and disinfection .</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>3B60987D-82F7-4AC9-8A93-411444EA5BAC</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>546002539885f3.77562849</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The following key results have been obtained.

The electric field distribution have been obtained using electrostatic field simulation package &amp;quot;ELECTRO&amp;quot;. An analytical solution to the space-charge saturated current in the cylindrical topology have been obtained using the Poisson and the continuity equations. The DC current-voltage characteristics of the corona discharges have been measured and the developed analytical model has been used to obtain space-charge influenced electric fields. A critical corona ignition field has been calculated using Peek's phenomenological approach and the depth of the ionisation zone in the reactor has been obtained. The behaviour of sub-microsecond impulsive corona discharges in air has been investigated. The impulse wave-forms have been measured using a high-speed HV probe and current transformers. The magnitude and time delay of current impulses, charge delivered into the reactor, and resistance of the corona discharges have been obtained for voltages up to 32kV. Hydrodynamic parameters of the corona discharges in air have been studied and it has been shown that these discharges are capable of generation of the air flow with velocity up to 3.5m/s which can be used to control the gas flow in the precipitation systems.

The precipitation experiments were conducted using single and double-stage cylindrical reactors. The precipitation efficiency has been obtained for positive HV DC voltage, positive HV impulses and combination of DC and HV impulses. It has been found that 16kV DC energisation results in 77% efficiency for a coarse powder; combination of DC voltage and 26-30kV impulses increases the precipitation efficiency up to 85%. In the case of fine powder the combined 15kV DC and 26kV impulses energisation mode significantly improves the precipitation efficiency, up to 81-99.6% in size ranges from 250nm to 5000nm. A reduction in the precipitation efficiency has been observed for 400-650nm particles, which can be attributed to a lower efficiency of their charging. The analytical Cochet approach which takes into account field and diffusion charging mechanisms has been used for calculation of the particle migration velocities. It has been shown that particles in this size range have minimum velocities. Experimental migration velocities obtained in the present study are in the range from 2.1 to 8.4m/s and they depend on the size of particles. These parameters are used in modelling and optimization of the performance of the m-ESP systems.

As a result of this project, it has been established that the combination of DC voltage and short impulses improves the precipitation efficiency of fine (less than 2500nm) and coarse airborne particles; efficiencies of ~100% have been achieved for particles larger than 2500nm.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>New air-cleaning and decontamination systems can be developed based on
