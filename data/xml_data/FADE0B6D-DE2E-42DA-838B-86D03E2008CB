When victims report this crime the&amp;nbsp; police are often unsure of how to deal with this crime. To date, victims have not been treated differently to any other fraud case - the legal system does not recognise the stress they experience over and above that of financial loss. This project will draw on findings from work supported by an ESRC grant that has investigated this crime.&lt;br />&lt;br />Specifically, the three objectives of the current proposed project are to:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>improve the quality of care for victims of the online romance scam&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>decrease the likelihood of re-victimisation&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>improve current policing practice with regards to dealing with victims of the online romance scam.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The activities proposed here will have important economic, social and policy/practice impacts. The economic impact will be: reducing the amount of money scammed from the individual (to avoid re-victimisation). Another important economic impact will be that implementation of these toolkits will provide SOCA officers with more time to spend on catching and convicting perpetrators of the romance scam rather than dealing with the consequences (hopefully leading to a reduction in the amount of people being scammed and thereby being of benefit to the nation's wealth). Social impacts will be providing an improved level of care to UK victims of this crime (thereby leading to improved psychological health). The policy and practice impacts are the implementation of new policy in police forces to change the way they currently deal with victims of the romance scam. The benefits of the project should realistically begin to be noticeable by the final month of the project. Details of the groups we anticipate will benefit from the project include: 

Victims of the romance scam (and family and friends of the victim): will benefit from improved psychological health from receiving a greater level of care at all levels, from reporting the crime, to taking statements and acting as witnesses. Moreover, they should benefit from the prevention strategies we devise to avoid re-victimisation. These toolkits should improve their overall quality of life. 
 
SOCA (Serious Organised Crime Agency): At present SOCA are dealing more with this crime than the police force. This is because of their expertise in the area and the lack of knowledge of the police force. Implementation of these toolkits will improve the level of care SOCA officers provide victims. However, the project intends to also provide the police force with toolkits so that they can take on more of the work with regards to dealing with the victims. Shifting the work to the police will provide SOCA officers with more time to spend on catching and convicting perpetrators of this scam, rather than dealing with the aftermath of the crime. We note here that in December 2013 the NCA (National Crime Agency) will replace SOCA. This does not affect our project, other than to increase the importance of documenting and passing on SOCA's expertise around this crime in the form of the toolkits we are developing.

NPIA (National Policing Improvement Agency): whose remit is to improve policing across the UK will obviously benefit from this project. The toolkits we provide are in line with their remit. The NPIA are due to be phased out in 2012; however, this will not affect our project, as they will still provide support for our work in their new form under the NCA. 

Police force in the UK: The toolkits will be of great use to the police force. The project intends to provide them with greater insights into the psychology of the crime and assist them in learning how to best notify victims of this scam, take statements, advise victims to act if they are contacted again, and to ensure that victims are provided with appropriate support. Moreover, learning better ways to treat witnesses involved with this crime can potentially lead to greater confidence in gaining convictions. They should begin to start noticing the benefits by the final month of the project.

ACPO (the Association of Chief Police Officers): whose remit is to provide a professional forum to share ideas and best practice, co-ordinate resources and help deliver effective policing which keeps the public safe will obvious benefit from these toolkits. SOCA will ensure that the project results are disseminated to this group.

Victim Support, psychologists, counsellors and other health professionals: would benefit from learning more about the psychological effect such scams have on an individual and can draw from the toolkits we devise. This should lead to improved support for victims of this crime.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>77544</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>London City Police: Workshop on online dating romance scam</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>558E4199-5849-46A8-BEAA-7A37D56C51CE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Prof Whitty ran 2 workshops for a fraud training course run by the City of London Police.

This body develops legislation and policy around regulation and ensures these are adhered to. The work helped shape future policy and legislation. Online dating companies were also invited to attend by the ACCC so they could be part of the discussion on how they should/might be made responsible for the prevention of this crime. Law enforcement officers from the different states participated via video link and we discussed possible interventions based on this research.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dda381070e41.87322034</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>1063851</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>DAPM: Detecting and Preventing Mass-Marketing Fraud (MMF)</gtr:description><gtr:end>2018-11-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>83B5BFF9-63BA-4F97-85E1-CA7D081871A4</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dda20522a517.01706935</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-06-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Our findings have been used to improve and change law enforcement practice both in the UK and Internationally.
