At present, these chemicals can only be sourced economically from fossil-oil. However, lignocellulose is a low-cost and renewable material available from plants from which aromatics can be obtained, both from lignin and indirectly from the cellulose portion. This project evaluates the commercial potential of novel work that has demonstrated high yielding and efficient conversion of a cellulose-derived chemical called HMF into a key novel building block (FDCA) for the synthesis of a biomass-derived bioplastic PBAF. The two- step enzyme process uses enzyme biocatalysts called oxidases which work at 37degC where water is the only by product. Hence the process has extremely green credentials. The project will evaluate sensitivity to the source and type of crude HMF used, improve reaction conditions and will be scaled up to produce gram quantities of FDCA. These will be converted into novel polymers and the properties of these materials tested. A techno-economic assessment of the holistic process will be carried out to evaluate the commercial potential in both the bioplastic and broader polyester markets.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Aromatic chemicals are a crucial constituent of plastics and bioplastics, conveying strength and flexibility. At present, these chemicals can only be sourced economically from fossil-oil. However, lignocellulose is a potential low-cost and renewable alternative input. This project will evaluate the commercial potential of novel work that has demonstrated a tandem bioconversion giving high yields (74% isolated, unoptimised) of the aromatic diacid, furan-2, 5-dicarboxylic acid (FDCA), from cellulose derived hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF), using isolated oxidase enzymes galactose oxidase M3-5 and E. coli aldehyde oxidase PaoABC. Both enzymes will be immobilised to compare performance with soluble enzymes. Loading efficiency, activity, re-use efficiency and product recovery will be optimised. This work will also provide important preliminary data for potential application in flow reactors. Reaction parameters, including pH control for HMF to FDCA in a two-step, one-pot conversion will be optimised. We will produce gram quantities of bio-derived FDCA with a target reaction concentration of 50g/L. We will also investigate a single stage process where both enzymes can be combined. This will require new GOase mutants that can convert the PaoABC by-product hydroxymethyl acid (HMFCA) to FDCA more effectively. If a suitable enzyme can be found we will substitute this for GOase M3-5 and thus potentially develop a combined GOase-PaoABC process. Biome will identify different sources of crude HMF and a process from a crude feed will be investigated. The FDCA produced will be converted into novel block co-polyesters/amides by Biome and the properties of these materials tested and compared with material made from commercially available FDCA and petrochemically-derived terephthalate analogue polymer PBAT. A techno-economic assessment of the holistic process will be carried out to evaluate the commercial potential in both the bioplastic and broader polyester markets.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>As described in proposal submitted to INNOVATE UK</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>123484</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Sixth Form College Visit</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>48EF39C0-D759-4014-8EB6-64F3154D382A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I (PI) visited Sir John Dean's Sixth Form College in Cheshire to give a Sixth Form Lecture to inspire students about research in Chemistry and to encourage students to apply to do chemistry. The talk contained slides directly related to this research project on conversion of Biomass to Bioplastics. I took along a box of samples of commercial products made from bioplastics supplied by our collaborators Biome Bioplastics to show the students. The outcome was well received and feedback at our Liverpool university Open Day was positive.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58a5aa81ae4260.34287729</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>118406</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Innovate UK IB Catalyst Industrial Research</gtr:description><gtr:end>2019-06-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>BB/N023625/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>7DD475F0-5EE2-404E-9F16-CDD6E6AA41C2</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58a5a63c914451.15266335</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-07-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput><gtr:description>Processes for the formation of furandicarboxylic acid (fdca) via a multistep biocatalytic oxidation reaction of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (hmf)</gtr:description><gtr:grantRef>BB/M028631/1</gtr:grantRef><gtr:id>15DF559C-7D9B-472A-A717-1FA18DFFF37C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None, yet.</gtr:impact><gtr:licensed>No</gtr:licensed><gtr:outcomeId>58a5a8d23dd6c6.19603109</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:patentId>WO2016202858 A1</gtr:patentId><gtr:protection>Patent application published</gtr:protection><gtr:title>Processes for the formation of furandicarboxylic acid (fdca) via a multistep biocatalytic oxidation reaction of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (hmf)</gtr:title><gtr:yearProtectionGranted>2016</gtr:yearProtectionGranted></gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput></gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have developed a biocatalytic route to a key intermediate (FDCA) monomer for bioplastics formation starting from HMF, which can be made from biomass. The award has allowed us to develop proof-of-principle for demonstration of feasibility for scale up of this multi-enzyme process. The bioconversion has advantages over other chemocatalytic and biocatalytic processes in that the conversion and product purity are very high and this is required for subsequent polymer formation. The collaborating company, Biome Technologies have patented the biopolymers that we will make. There is potential for new IP in the immobilisation and application of the biocatalysts we are developing.</gtr:description><gtr:id>255753AC-971D-4665-8D02-F4E60BBA00B4</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56ab5a70631619.08321826</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors/></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E25E3724-96AB-45D1-901D-3CDABA95155D</gtr:id><gtr:title>The continuous oxidation of HMF to FDCA and the immobilisation and stabilisation of periplasmic aldehyde oxidase (PaoABC)</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Green Chemistry</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9d4145c51525f4ec78c0bee9248f9cbe"><gtr:id>9d4145c51525f4ec78c0bee9248f9cbe</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>McKenna S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fcecf5d73b7.42825659</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/M028631/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F442B6BE-8B89-4C01-8D3B-E8A4D320B672</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biomolecules &amp; biochemistry</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>60EBB420-734E-4DB5-B0F2-65A1115A27F8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical synthesis</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B971A4E6-FF4B-45BC-96D6-1E289961490D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Catalysis &amp; enzymology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>454398F2-57A6-4959-8845-0F248CF4D5C4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical Synthetic Methodology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
