We are developing an in-store customer engagement platform for retailers to help them provide amazing experiences to their customers in their physical stores using iBeacon technology. We recently won McDonalds Hackathon with our product to help McDonalds in enhancing their in-store customer experience. We are also one of the winners of UKTI Sirius program and are currently being funded by UKTI itself.

Problem:
Retailers don?t know who their customers are but they want to provide personalized experience to their customers when they visit their store. They want to provide targeted recommendations, relevant offers and let their staff know about how valuable a customer is when they enter a store. 

All this has worked very well in e-commerce and is used widely, but this hasn?t been possible for the offline commerce i.e. in the physical storefronts of the retailers

Solution:
We have created a product using which, we can detect when a customer walks into a store. We can not only tell the retailer what the customer has bought in the past, but also what they are interested in buying on their current visit. We also provide a way for retailers to interact with the customer in their store in real time. All this happens with customer?s consent.

Using this product retailers can provide relevant recommendations, targeted offers, helpful tips, digital receipt and mobile loyalty card to customers in their store. This would help them in enhancing customer?s experience and increasing sales.

We do this using 3 core pieces of our product. 

Firstly, we use Apple?s iBeacon technology, which tells us customer?s in-store location. 

Secondly, our unique technology to seamlessly integrate with any Point-of-Sale (POS) software, tells us what customer is buying. This technology is called POSLink. 

Thirdly, our mobile application interacts with our above-mentioned technologies and provides benefits to customers like digital receipts, mobile loyalty cards and personalized offers and recommendations.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>5000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">752073</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
