SPP provides unique coverage of grey literature (local and central government reports, policy papers etc; and research institute, think tank and consultants' reports). While its coverage of social policy is broad, it currently lacks in-depth coverage of child protection and child care. The National Society for the Protection of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC ) database holds one of the world's most comprehensive collections of research documentation on child protection and child care, and the proposed research will enhance the content and quality of the SPP database by incorporating significant content from this important source. The very high proportion of grey literature in SPP (some 30%) will be further increased by the inclusion of NSPCC database content. By this means, the project is also intended to remedy an imbalance in in many of the research reviews produced in the UK, arising from their excessive reliance upon databases produced in the United States. Whilst these sources, such as Sociological Abstracts or Social Services Abstracts, include comprehensive coverage of peer reviewed research journal content, they ignore virtually all UK produced reports and other forms of grey literature. This reliance on USA sources has led in the past to bias in the research reviews produced in the UK to addresss policy issues in central and local government and in the non-governmental sector.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The impact achieved by the proposed research will be through pre-existing networks in the Social Policy and Practice consortium of organisations and the wider Evidence &amp;amp; Policy community. Users and NGO database providers are closely involved in the development of the SPP database, as demonstrated by the letters of support appended. Measures of impact will be the more extensive and intensive use of the database and the production of more well-founded Systematic Reviews and Rapid Evidence Assessments in the social policy field.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-10-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-06-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>20623</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The project made available to users in the academic, practitioner and research communities an enhanced publications social policy and practice database.

The principal achievement of the project was to make available to users in the academic, practitioner and research communities, an enhanced publications database incorporating a further c. 9000 entries that had been developed in incompatible format by NSPCC. This enhanced database is now available.

Meeting the grant objectives
The original Social Policy and Practice database drew upon data from a consortium of five parties: the Social Care Institute for Excellence, the National Children's Bureau, the Centre for Policy on Ageing, Idox, and the Greater London Authority. The project fully achieved its objective to produce an enhanced Social Policy and Practice database by the incorporation of data provided by the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC). The tasks involved in this exercise included:
? Reviewing the NSPCC data format and record structure
? Designing a programme to handle conversion of the NSPCC data to SPP format
? Conversion of the NSPCC data to SPP format
? Load of data
? Testing for Quality Assurance
After rigorous testing between September and December, an initial load containing 996 NSPCC records went &amp;quot;live&amp;quot; early in January 2015; and the full complement of the NSPCC data (9,931 records) was made available on 5th January 2015 as part of the enhanced Social Policy and Practice database service.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Taking forward the findings
The SPP Consortium (NSPCC; Idox Plc; NCB; SCIE and CPA).which acts as the advisory group for this project decided that the marketing and promotion programme would initially be directed at University heads of departments, directors of research institutes and leading figures in research based faculties rather than librarians. This was because as Ovid Technologies already heavily promotes all its databases including Social Policy &amp;amp; Practice to university librarians specialising in social and health care and policy and related fields and it was felt that at a time of restricted availability of funds the library staff would respond to pressure from academic staff to purchase specific databases but would not take the initiative without that pressure. 
Accordingly, some 200 addresses of relevant university departments, research institutes and faculties were indentified and where possible their heads, directors, deans, etc were also identified. A further list was compiled of some 70 independent research institutes and relevant government departments, quangos, and the larger charities with research departments. A personally addressed letter outlining the strengths of the Social Policy &amp;amp; Practice database in its enhanced form was sent signed by senior staff representing all five partners in the SPP Consortium. In addition, the Association of Librarians in the Social Sciences has agreed to use its mailing list to send the letter to academic library staff across the UK.
For some 12 years The Centre for Evidence &amp;amp; Policy at King's College London ran an Associates' Network and although the Centre ceased operation in December 2013 the mailing list for the Centre Newsletter is still in existence and this will be used to draw attention to the database and its new data via e-mail. This mailing list comprises some 1800 named academics, central and local government officers, research institute, think tank and charity personnel in 27 countries.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>996E203A-2E77-4917-93C9-C47546B0407C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>550547f6a08d12.53615618</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/M003078/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>ACFABADE-E54A-4FC7-B9F5-259A19D97CDB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Work</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D8C04024-FB47-49BA-9905-98DD5083D92E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Children and Families</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5C7160C4-5BCB-4F38-BA94-1DC4E168F5BF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>International Social Work</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACFABADE-E54A-4FC7-B9F5-259A19D97CDB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Work</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>13B8FF54-243A-4AFA-9EE2-F6869124F305</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Work with Adults</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
