The term refers to a way of representing multiple indicators, data and news, in real-time and side-by-side. Organisations build dashboards so as to display 'key performance indicators', on which senior management can base decisions. UK Prime Minister David Cameron has commissioned a tailor-made dashboard for his iPad, to keep him constantly updated on key indicators such as GDP and house prices. However, with the rise of Big Data and the proliferation of smart devices in everyday life, this type of display is increasingly available for individuals for everyday activities. For example, the 'London Dashboard' is a website offering real-time data on traffic, weather, tube line status, local twitter trends, markets and other indicators, for everyday purposes. Dashboard apps, such as Google Now, offer ways of bringing together various sources of data into a handy, usable format. 

Dashboards are a worthy object of social scientific investigation for a number of reasons. Firstly, they problematise how the notion of risk is understood. Risk is a key concept for how contemporary societies are governed, managed and theorised by social scientists, and has previously been analysed via particular techniques (such as audit and accounting) through which the future is represented numerically. Dashboards offer a different numerical representation, of a future that is constantly emerging, without moments of static evaluation as provided by audit. In this, their numbers resemble market prices. Indeed financial markets (and the digital displays they use) might be seen as one of the progenitors of dashboards more generally. Secondly, dashboards offer a basis on which to reflect critically on how data exists in everyday life, how it fits into practices and decision-making, and the methods involved in making data useful. Thirdly, the spread of dashboards also involves the spread of a particular vision of agency and authority, in which individuals are constantly navigating, deciding, strategising, and interpreting on the basis of constant updates. Finally, as the social sciences are themselves facing the challenges and opportunities of Big Data, we believe that dashboards can be productively incorporated into research practices and the dissemination of outputs. 

The research project takes three empirical cases, in order to understand how dashboards are integrated into a range of situations and for different purposes. We will study civil servants in Government Digital Services who have built and are using dashboards to visualise and 'open up' the performance of Whitehall departments. We will also study the Digital Action Lab, a civic activist organisation, as they develop and release a 'crowdsourced' dashboard which provides a range of indicators on prosperity, equality and environment in Britain. Finally, we will study the personal use of dashboards on phones and tablets, where dashboards visualise and arrange data flows in ways that make them intelligible and actionable for individuals.

The main project questions are:
1. How are organisations and individuals using dashboards? Specifically, we ask: what kinds of indicators are used and for what purpose? What is the temporality or 'liveness' of these indicators? What is the relationship between indicators and other signifiers on the dashboard?
2. How are dashboards incorporated into and transforming decision-making processes? Are dashboards evidence of a general transformation in the temporality of judgement and decision-making? How do individuals cope with the multiplicity and inconclusiveness of dashboard indicators? 
3. How can the social sciences incorporate dashboards as tools and also as research outputs? What can be learnt from existing dashboards? Conversely, how can the knowledge and expertise of the social sciences be fed into dashboard design?</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project concerns issues regarding the visualisation of data, and its organisational and public significance, that is of direct concern to government, civil society, business and everyday users of digital devices. The potential impact of the project is therefore very far-reaching. Moreover, given the choice of case studies and research partners, the project will establish a space of knowledge exchange that cuts between academic, government and civic stakeholders, creating networks which will out-last the duration of the project. In this project, we do not approach impact as a goal only after knowledge has been collected and processed, but aim for constant dialogue between social scientific researchers and expert users, on the question of how data is to be managed, visualised, shared and acted upon. Dashboards provide an object of concern, around which researchers and research users congregate. 

The project meets the ESRC's three categories of impact in the following ways:
- 'Instrumental': it will influence policy-makers and civic activists, seeking to use dashboards for purposes of service modernisation, open government and campaigning.
- 'Conceptual': it will advance a social scientific discourse and public understanding regarding dashboards, as critical devices for the management and visualisation of change, in organisations, government, civil society and everyday life.
- 'Capacity building': it will assist in the development of new dashboards, at work in government, business, civil society and academia, by injecting social and cultural knowledge regarding the efficacy and 'social life' of data visualisation.

The key stakeholders for the project are identified as follows:

Government, public policy &amp;amp; public services
- Government Digital Services (GDS) 
- Cabinet Office
- Department for Business Innovation &amp;amp; Skills
- Communities &amp;amp; Local Government
- City and local government (Local Government Association, Greater London Authority, local authorities)
- Think tanks - Demos, Policy Exchange, ippr, Policy Network

Civil society, activists &amp;amp; artists
- e-democracy activists and charities - Open Data Institute, mySociety.org, change.org, Digital Action Lab
- Hubs for social innovation - NESTA, The Young Foundation
- Social indicators practitioners - New Economics Foundation
- Experimental and arts groups - London Quantified Self group


The possible benefits for these stakeholders are as follows:

- Influencing public service modernisation: Policy makers and civil servants (in central and local government) will benefit from the research, by considering the 'social life' of data and dashboards, as contributors to organisational accountability and culture. Researchers will share findings with GDS, from other investigations into dashboard design and use. 

- Advancing the transparency/openness agenda: The project speaks directly to those in government and outside, interested in advancing 'openness' and 'transparency', through making more data publicly available. UK government is interested in whether dashboards can increase public accountability, through revealing more information about performance to citizens. The project will look at how this works in practice, how it overlaps with other concerns to do with public service reform, and potential legitimacy problems that result.

- Informing citizens using data visualisation: Various civic groups and campaigns currently seek to use data that is available to mobilise publics, around specific issues. Dashboards are at the cutting edge of this, but various questions are still unanswered, regarding the civic potential of Big Data. This project will contribute to better public, citizen and activist understanding of strategies associated with visualisation, design, customisation and use. 

- Producing new networks between policy-makers, technologists, activists and researchers.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>184651</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The Index of Performative Keys is the 'visual provocation' for future dashboard design component of the project.

1. Decision-making and distributed cognition. We proposed to study how people used dashboards to make decisions, and suggested that the nature of decision-making (in terms of time, factors, and procedures) might be changing. Our study did confirm this, but it also suggested something more significant. We found that through dashboards, individuals are coupled with intelligent systems that complicate the idea of decision making as attributable to a specific individual. What we found was most significant was not simply how dashboards change how people make decisions, but how the human-dashboard-system configuration requires a rethinking of what and where decision-making is and resides. 

2. Design and Data. We found that the role of design is absolutely central to how data is collected, used and presented, but it barely features at all in discussion about data. Here, we do not mean the design of data collection, but rather 'design thinking' and design practice. To put it concisely, we found that design expertise and design authority (product design, UX design, etc.) was very influential in how flows of data and related interfaces were implemented into organisational settings. 

3. Dashboard and Performance (Bias). Our historical study of dashboards investigated how they have been used and understood in very different settings, from cars and planes, to control rooms, organisations and phone apps. Contemporary dashboards often 'carry along' these historical legacies in their design (such as the persistence of gauges originated from car dashboards). However, we found that dashboard design carries with it a performance bias or rather 'Performance tendency' in that the format itself tends to encourage forms of measure, attention and monitoring, and indication that lends itself to performance management. In other words, when you put data in a dashboard, there is a tendency for it to be used to manage performance, even though this might not be a natural or obvious use of the data. 

4. Social Science Knowledge Production and Dashboards. Our research proposed to consider how social scientific knowledge might be fed into dashboard design through the create of a series of visual provocations. This was the most challenging but also most satisfy aspect of the research. We found that in order to generate our visualisations, we had to draw upon methods not common within the social sciences. Instead, we had to draw upon the methods of designers and similar creative practice, such as prototyping, pitching ideas, drawing, and so on. It suggests that if the social sciences are to engage with these emerging areas, we have to be willing to 'meet half way' and partially rethink our own methods for knowledge production.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We believe that the changing relationship between data, interfaces and cognition that our study identified needs further attention. This could be taken forward through more research and the development of new research methods for the study of interfaces.

Further study is also needed on the role of design in structuring human interaction with data. It is this area of expertise that mediates and socialises data-driven practices but it is often completely overlooked with the social sciences. A research project on the design of data could take this further.

Findings from our study could be used to educate users of dashboards in the education, corporate and public sectors, to help foster more informed use of these interfaces.

Artists and designers could use our findings (and especially our visual provocation) to help rethink dashboard design. These could be developed through exhibitions or rapid prototyping workshops, for example.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5BC6F264-0B8E-40CD-8C0C-8394BDFC0384</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e188900efca7.31435048</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://blogs.cim.warwick.ac.uk/readingdashboards</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Consultation/Seminar with City of Melbourne, Smart City Office</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Australia</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AF905E54-B8AC-488A-B71D-DD0797D5FD4D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>My influence here is not on policy but practice. In December 2015 I was invited to present my research on dashboards within public services to the City of Melbourne, Smart City Office. The presentation was followed by an open consultation with a team of public servants tasked with creating a dashboard for the city of Melbourne, Australia. It was clear from the discussion that the team did not possess preexisting expertise in the creation of City Dashboards, nor were they overly aware of the numerous types of dashboards they could conceivably create. It was very clear that my visit impacted the way they were thinking about dashboards. Key areas that they had not considered were: who the users would be (tourists, locals, regular or one-time users, etc.); whether it would be designed for mobile or web; whether it would be generic or personalisable; whether it would focus on environmental and logistical measures or focus more on social ones.
