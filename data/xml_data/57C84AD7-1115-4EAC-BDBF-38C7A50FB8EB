Taking widening participation as a focus, the aim is to interrogate what universities are doing in relation to poverty reduction and achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. The project aims to explore factors that facilitate or impede participation in higher education, and to examine approaches taken by state and private providers to widen participation. This will involve examination of policy frameworks and codes of practice for widening participation of under-represented groups in higher education in Ghana and Tanzania. It will also include evaluating the success of widening participation initiatives via scrutiny of statistical data and interviews with key staff, policymakers and community advocates. Life-history narrative research will also be pursued to capture the experiences of students from 'non-traditional' backgrounds. Local teams will be set up comprising researchers, managers, students and equity advocates to identify datasets that will help them construct equity scorecards for promoting inclusion and achievement of socially and economically excluded groups.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>569767</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Momentum and melancholia : gender equity in higher education.

Dear Louise,
I attended your paper at the SRHE Conference in Liverpool last year. 
Should there be any scope for research or collaborative ventures, perhaps we could work together as I believe our institutions would benefit greatly from dialogue and feedback?

Hi Louise

it was great to catch up yesterday. Thanks for a thought provoking seminar. The findings of your project on widening participation in HE in Ghana and Tanzania were particularly interesting.

Thanks also for your invitation to visit CHEER next year. As discussed, I plan to be in the UK from late June until about early December. Perhaps Barbara and I could present a seminar at the Centre.

Dear Prof. Morley!
My name is Bernadette M?ller and I am a research assistant at the University of Graz. I would be very interested in your paper &amp;quot;Intersecting poverty and participation in higher education in Ghana and Tanzania&amp;quot;, but I do not have access to the International Studies in Sociology of Education. Therefore I ask you kindly, if it is possible for you to send me the paper? I would be very grateful.
Many thanks a

Hi Louise
 
I heard you were inspiring at the Sri Lanka conference. I'm getting together with someone who was there and she's going to share her experiences with us, a group of Equity Officers in WA.
 
Just thought I'd share the paper that I've finally submitted to a journal, Critical Studies in Business and Society. Hope it
