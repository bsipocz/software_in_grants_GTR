In 751, Charlemagne's father, Pippin III, rose from the ranks of the aristocracy to become king and found a royal line. In 888, that line lost its exclusivity and non-Carolingian 'kinglets' sprang up in the Frankish world. This book differs from other distinguished recent work on the Carolingians: it covers the whole period of exclusive Carolingian rule; it focuses on centres rather than regions; and it argues that this was less a world regulated by consensus than one characterised by the vigorous assertion of a distinctive form of unassailable authority: the special status of the royal family itself. That period of 751 to 888 had the Carolingian royal family as the defining institution of its age, and this book explores how it triumphantly negotiated its transition from the ranks of the aristocracy to the exalted status of royalty, a status that it guarded jealously and succesfully for over a century. But guarding that status was an endless task; the dynasty could not relax; its special status had to be constantly articulated and proclaimed. To argue that the royal family was itself the most important institution in the realm, because it gave that realm its specific identity, is not to argue that this world was 'primitive', patrimonial and simple. On the contrary, the complex and creative ways in which this family made itself universally present in its world testify to the political creativity of Carolingian political culture. This was a family as an institution that constantly performed its identity in a variety of ways. The great kings and their wars, assemblies, treasures and palaces are the most familiar figures buth they were only part of a much larger royal cast. Young children played key roles in defining, broadcasting and performing the charismatic specialness of Frankish royalty; tough warriors carried the baptismal shawl of an infant Carolingian girl all the way to Rome; the accidental fall of a young roayl boy from a palace window in Bavaria triggered contemporary reflections on the gloomy prospects of the dynasty. The life-cycle of the royals set the pace for politics. And all this was displayed and performed in the great palaces and sacred places of the realm. The copying of royal genealogies testified to belief in the specialness of the Carolingian past, and an implied future. This book combines analysis of such practices with survey of the political conflicts of the period. Such conflicts, ranging from, e.g., the revolt of Bernard of Italy in 817 to the stripping of his Carolingian identity from Carloman, son of Charles the Bald in the 870s, turned on the status of the dynasty's members. In fact, the Carolingians were too successful in convincing their world that they were special. The aristocracy accepted the claims of a variety of discontented and marginalised Carolingian family members with the result that attempts by Louis the Pious (814-840) and his successors to define their family more narrowly foundered on the very feature that was the dynasty's strength: its unique charisma.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research is to form a scholarly monograph and was conceived as such some time ago. It would be disingenous to claim that I envisage or have planned for this research to have impact as currently defined and understood by the AHRC. To say this is not to make lofty claims for 'pure' scholarship but simply to recognise that this research project was not conceived in terms of broad non-academic impact. Its exploration of topics such as the performance of identity, gender relations in royal families, the fate of royal children, and forms of communication in a pre-modern world are surely of general interest. Potental reaction to this research by its academic beneficiaries may have some form of 'impact' in the future. For example, the Diverging Paths research group, of which I am a member, may well profit from this research in its future work and at some stages in our early planning for that group's work the possibility of an exhibition was aired. But all that can only be possibility. My belief is that this research is accessibly written and covers themes of central social and cultural importance and so a potential reading public outside the academy can be envisaged.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>22292</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Participation in workshop held in Frankfurt, Germany, for preparation of an exhibition in the Historische Museum Frankfurt on the Carolingians and Images to be held there in 2017.

My own discussion of the Lothar crystal in the British Museum London led to wider consideration of 'speaking objects' from the period and the Director responded that he now wished to explore the possibility of obtaining a loan of the Alfred Jewel from the Ashmolean Museum Oxford for his exhibition. I remain doubtful that he will succeed.
I myself learned much about the background planning of a historical exhibition through my visit to Frankfurt; this was the first time that I have been involved in any planning for an exhibition.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54637f9cb88945.97761685</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.historisches-museum.frankfurt.de/index.php?article_id=692&amp;clang=0</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>I repeat here my point on engagement as in the My Portfolio section, ie on my participation at a workshop in Frankfurt Historical Museum, Germany, in 2013 as preparation for an exhibition on the Carolingians to be held there in 2017 and I hope that my contributions will feed into the exhibition itself.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>54603FFA-D97D-4A1E-B832-D9F220BBE2AA</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5464af66279ca2.16875283</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Research confirmed the importance of royal family relationships in the Carolingian period (751-888)and the unique distinctiveness of that family (its exclusive right to the throne) in the period's political culture.

The ways in which political discourse of that family's authority was constructed and communicated sheds light on pre-modern political systems.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>I hope that when my book is finally completed and published readers will see the potential general applicability of the argument that political authority needs to continually perform itself in order to be 'natural'.
