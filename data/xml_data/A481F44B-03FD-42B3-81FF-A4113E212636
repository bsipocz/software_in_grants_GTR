Mitigating the environmental impacts of this is a key priority. In order to meet important, and increasingly stringent, regulatory limits on NOx emissions &amp;quot;lean burn&amp;quot; combustors are seen as a vital step. Lean burn combustors use more air in the combustion zone to reduce the flame temperature and the formation of pollutants. The downside to this is that the &amp;quot;thermoacoustic&amp;quot; stability of the flame is reduced. Fluctuations in heat release lead to pressure waves which affect the flow of fuel and air into the combustor which in turn can affect the heat release. This two-way coupling can lead to a feedback loop causing large, and damaging, pressure oscillations. For lean burn technology to be successfully developed this thermoacoustic instability must be controlled. Numerical simulation tools have a vital part to play in this. If the stability or otherwise of a design can be predicted in a computational simulation, without the need for testing a physical prototype then a great deal of resources can be saved. Accurate numerical simulation can also give a deeper understanding of the physical processes involved than experiments alone. 
Most gas turbines and all aero engines use liquid fuel. The fuel is broken up into a spray which mixes with and evaporates into a swirling air flow. One of the major hurdles standing in the way of accurate simulation of thermoacoustic behaviour in burners of this type is how to model the effect of acoustic pressure waves on the formation and transport of the spray. Currently assumptions and empirical relations have to be used to define the time varying air and fuel inlet conditions and these are of questionable applicability. In particular they take no account of the delay or &amp;quot;phase shift&amp;quot; in the aerodynamic response of the airflow to a pressure wave, which is vital for capturing the true unsteady behaviour of a combustion system. This proposal aims to overcome this hurdle by developing properly validated computational methods for simulating sprays in complex swirling flows under the influence of acoustic waves.
Validation of this method requires access to appropriate experimental data. Such data has recently been produced at Loughborough University (LU). A typical lean burn fuel atomizer, in which fuel is injected between two co-annular swirling air streams, has been tested with acoustic forcing. Data is available for the time varying fuel droplet size, number and velocity at several locations in the flow. This data will be used in the following ways:
1. Methods of deriving accurate spray and air inlet conditions for a range of acoustic excitation frequencies will be developed. These will be tested by comparison with the experimental data from close to the injector and also compared to the current simplified method of deriving the spray inlet conditions. The errors associated with the assumptions in all methods will be studied systematically. The prediction of air flow response to a pressure wave in the separate airflow passages of the fuel injector will be improved by the use of a compressible CFD method developed at LU. 
2. Simulations of the spray transport process in the presence of acoustic forcing will be carried out using the inlet conditions developed in the first part of the proposal. These simulations, validated against experimental data taken further downstream, will be a thorough test of the inlet conditions and of the modelling methods employed. They will also provide a deeper understanding of the flow physics involved. This will include the effects of turbulent mixing and acoustic forcing on droplets of different sizes and the relative importance of the different airflow streams in the injector. This understanding, coupled with improved boundary conditions will be of great value in designing low emission combustors of the future.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The primary motivation for this project is to enable successful simulation of the thermoacoustic instabilities which can occur in liquid fuelled combustion systems as found in gas turbines. Combustion instabilities are one of the major obstacles to the successful development of new low-emission 'lean-burn' combustors. Reducing the pollution produced by energy generation technology, such as gas turbines, will benefit society as a whole and aligns with one of the EPSRC's high level research themes. The UK aerospace industry, of which engine manufacture forms a key part, generates revenue of almost &amp;pound;28 billion a year and has grown at 10 times the rate of the wider economy over the last three years. Research, such as that proposed here, which directly supports this will benefit the UK economy. 
Currently the development of robust lean burn designs can only be achieved by a costly and time consuming iterative process of experimental testing and redesign. A computational method capable of simulating unsteady flame behaviour would be of great value in the design of successful lean-burn combustors as it would dramatically reduce the time and cost involved in the process. The ability to develop low-emission combustion technology in this fashion would be a significant competitive advantage to UK gas turbine manufacturers. Conversely not having this ability when overseas competitors are able to develop it would be a serious commercial disadvantage. This project aims to remove one of the major obstacles to producing accurate simulations of unsteady spray flame behaviour.
Rolls-Royce is a key player in the gas turbine market and they are a project partner in this proposal. This builds on the long-standing relationship between Rolls-Royce and Loughborough University through the University Technology Centre (UTC). Rolls-Royce have agreed to the use of an existing prototype lean-burn fuel atomizer in this project and have also agreed that experimental data obtained using this prottype can be used and published. This will ensure that the research is of genuine practical relevance. The work will be carried out using a combination of open source and Rolls-Royce's in-house CFD codes which will ensure that any methodology developed in this project can be rapidly adopted by Rolls-Royce. These methodologies will also be made available to other industrial gas turbine companies and academic researchers through publication in high quality journals and presentation at suitable international conferences.
EPSRC recognises the importance of maintaining the health of the fluid mechanics discipline in which this proposal is based. Similarly, the UK has a world leading reputation in development of advanced CFD which is an example of the application of another EPSRC priority; mathematical sciences. This proposal will provide specialist training and experience in applied mathematical sciences for the research associate funded by this proposal and also for a university funded PhD student who will be associated with this project.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-07-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-01-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>97129</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Rolls Royce Group Plc</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Industrial collaboration with Rolls-Royce</gtr:description><gtr:id>EBA89251-186D-4D18-A586-CD77B87D8C4E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>ASME paper</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b6e9cf9f7610.94456523-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Rolls-Royce have provided the project with a realistic fuel injector geometry as well as permission to use experimental data already collected using this geometry.

Software capable of simulating these processes is a key tool to (a) enable understanding of these instabilities and (b) in future design systems which can overcome these issues. This will enable UK industry to develop technical advantages over competitors. While the response of the fuel injector to acoustic perturbations is a key part of this, much previous research has concentrated on the response of gaseous fuelled systems. Our research so far has used experimental data from an acoustically forced fuel injector to test different methods of predicting the change in the spray (number of droplets, size of droplets etc) under acoustic perturbation. Results so far show an encouraging level of agreement with the experimental data and this has been communicated with Rolls-Royce who will be able to make use of this information. The next target is to include the varying spray properties into a reacting flow calculation to assess the level of combustion instability that can be attributed to the changing spray properties. 

Alongside this, the gas phase flow field from simulations of acoustically forced flows have been analysed. These have used computational analysis tools, such as Proper Orthogonal Decomposition, to separate out the acoustic and hydrodynamic parts of the unsteady flow field. Methods of extracting unsteady velocity at the fuel injector from a compressible simulation for use in an incompressible simulation are also being developed. For these types of flow incompressible simulations, are quicker, require smaller simulation domains and allow a wider range of combustion modelling than an incompressible simulation and so this is potentially a significant advantage.These are currently being tested in an in-house simulation code at Rolls-Royce which will enable this work to have a greater impact more quickly as the method is transferred directly into industry where it can be used.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2017</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>B8D96FF2-2D1D-49BC-894B-55D0A6C8063A</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>58beec5f0ac998.33449697</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/M023893/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>772CD758-53CD-407F-9B2C-F2B861E86155</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mechanical Engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ED6338AE-3457-45D6-90CA-B994C3CF422B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>33</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Aerodynamics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3C7829C5-FA2A-4084-834D-56F41F83E977</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>34</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Combustion</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>93295214-E29B-49B2-AA54-09445C36CAF2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>33</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Heat &amp; Mass Transfer</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
