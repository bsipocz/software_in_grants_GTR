This central London gyratory is the former site of the Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens. VP[2] will investigate the ephemeral and oneiric qualities of live performance and interrogate the relationship between political protest and entertainment, traffic and pedestrians, pollution, breathing and song via two practice based outputs: a composition and a film; and a refereed journal article. VP[2] will extend the scope of the proto-discipline of Sonic Archaeology examining and testing new methodologies with a view to enabling new modes of investigation in the development of site-specific art practice. \n\nThe research builds on the innovative interaction of Sonic Archaeology, Live Art and Socially Engaged Practice evident in VP[1]. This pilot project featured the return of the sung voice to Vauxhall Cross on 6th August 2004. Transformations of Arcadian Songs by Thomas Arne (1710-1787) - originally written for performance at the Pleasure Gardens - met with the thunderous roar of the traffic and the systematic controls of the traffic light system. \n\nSonic Archaeology is the study of the former sonic profile of a specific site - the pursuit of past soundscapes. VP[2] will counterpoint this past sonic profile - the distinctive sound of mid Eighteenth Century song - with the present sonic profile of the site - the thunderous weaving counterpoint of hundreds of Internal Combustion Engines on their faltering passage through the site governed by the traffic light system. The harpsichord continuo will co-exist with the articulated truck. Alongside what could be termed the proto-discipline of Sonic Archaeology; Live Art and Socially Engaged Practice provide more familiar contexts for the research. The live performance of 6th August 2004 plotted a series of connections between the language of protest and the language of site performance - a performative Sonic Archaeology. \n\nThe aims and objectives of VP[2] are:\n\n1. To energise debate regarding the research territory and status of Sonic Archaeology - to examine the past, present and future soundscapes of urban sites. \n\n2. To establish a series of methodologies to expand the practice of Sonic Archaeology. \n\n3. To interrogate the past and present soundscapes of Vauxhall Cross, London - former site of the Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens. \n\n4. To scrutinise the actions of the singers who performed at Vauxhall Cross during VP[1] and so expose the relationship between the languages and behaviours of political and civil protest; and cross-disciplinary arts practice. \n\nThese objectives will be pursued, interrogated and fulfilled via the creation of three outputs: \n\na. A thirty-seven minute musical Composition for seven live instrumentalists and thirty-one loudspeakers exploring the simultaneous presentation of the sonic past and the sonic present. The work will counterpoint sonic materials of the past - The Arcadian songs of Thomas Arne - and the present - internal combustion engine; alongside the sonic control mechanisms of the past - tonality and form - and the present - a traffic-light system able to release or restrain the sonic power of the vehicles that thunder through the site. \n\nb. A thirty-minute broadcast quality Film that will seek to examine the impact on Vauxhall Cross of the performative mode of Sonic Archaeology - privileging and amplifying the ephemeral and oneiric qualities of the return of the sung voice to Vauxhall Cross.\n\nc. A refereed journal article examining the extension of existing knowledge and practices in Sonic Archaeology with reference to the interrogation of site instigated by VP[1] and the methodologies employed in the creation of outputs a. and b. \n\n\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>39199</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The installation work was part of a touring project funded by the Sound and Music Cutting Edge touring program.

We have investigated the ephemeral nature of public art performance by capturing this using documentary procedures.

A series of strategies for re-reading or mis-reading existing musical scores has been developed that creates the possibility of real-time audio analysis of the content of pre-exisiting scores.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>It would be interesting to see wider debate about the use of space informed by the way that the space sounds and the way that that sound impacts on users of the space. There is a concentration on the visual in the development of urban spaces. Vauxhall Pleasure argues strongly that sound should be a key element in strategies for urban development.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>1213E875-9703-43BB-BC3B-76994F6B39BF</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54635493058994.30217448</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Education,Environment,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/E002331/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>38E9B207-EFC4-4B48-AF70-C67AC5978934</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Drama &amp; theatre studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>0AEFDABE-67A4-48B1-9DB4-99393BDE6065</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Music</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A13304AD-8058-4333-86C7-DB798216A696</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Composition</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>2D2B04A8-2CC9-41D9-B5EF-78E0AF1A8B24</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Installation &amp; Sound Art HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9BB7B92A-CA2F-416A-8A6C-ED65BF575E45</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Performance &amp; Live Art</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
