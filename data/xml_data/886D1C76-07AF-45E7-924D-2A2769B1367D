An aggregation pheromone for S. lineatus, highly attractive to both sexes, was identified by Rothamsted Research in the early 1980's. A monitoring trap for B. rufimanus, incorporating a floral lure, is under development in TSB project 100871. This project will develop a 'lure and kill' trap combining entomopathogenic fungi with semio-chemicals, formulated electrostatically to enable better delivery to target insects. This will provide an effective and novel pest management tool. There is currently no bio-control system available to UK pulse growers for these pests. Use of insecticide as a killing agent will also be tested. The project will advance sustainable intensification of agriculture and deliver economic impact for the UK Agri-Tech industry by tackling the challenge to quality and production caused by insect pests of pea and bean crops whilst reducing adverse impacts on the environment. Many growers apply 5 to 6 pyrethroid sprays to achieve sufficient control of adult Sitona lineatus to prevent yield loss, and as pest pressure increases, insecticides prove less effective. Alternative approaches for crop protection are needed.

Successful delivery of the project would provide positive feedback in allowing partners to realise the benefit of investing in R&amp;amp;D. The system will be transferable to other pests and crops. Increasing the confidence of growers that yield and quality impact can be controlled using this system could lead to an increase in the area of peas and beans grown in the UK. The SMEs in the consortium (PGRO, Exosect, Oecos and Velcourt) would grow and the large company (BASF) would market project outcomes overseas.

The project would generate economic benefit and value to the UK economy on several levels: 
a) Pea and bean growers in the UK and the main global pulse growing regions would benefit from reduced yield and quality losses and more efficient farm operations and from reductions in pesticide applications.
b) Pulse crops are nitrogen fixing and have great benefits in the crop rotation as they can help to reduce the build-up of pests, weeds and diseases of other crops. They also provide a valuable source of vegetable protein. Thus, there would be wider benefits from making their production more reliable for growers. Government and EU policy has identified protein crops as high priority for research and development, to increase levels of home-grown pulses to supply animal feed markets and increase sustainability of supplies by reducing soya bean imports. The market for UK pulses is currently undersupplied and potential for creating new markets for human consumption products, whilst increasing levels of pulse protein in animal feed is high.
c) There is potential to increase the export market of UK grown peas and beans, especially if grower confidence in yield and quality is improved.
d) The knowledge economy of the UK would benefit as companies realise the opportunity for meeting gaps in the market in agriculture by investing in R&amp;amp;D to deliver innovation (which is urgently needed for crop protection).
e) The manufacturing sector would grow as the UK develops new crop protection solutions for the home and export markets.
f) The project, by contributing to more efficient crop production, would help to maintain lower food prices with consequent health, social and economic benefits for society in general. Food prices are at historically low levels as a proportion of income but collapses in crop protection in the EU could lead to rising food costs, especially as imported food might not remain as inexpensive as it currently is as countries such as China become more affluent and increase their purchasing power.
g) More efficient crop production (lower losses to pests) reduces the environmental impact of agriculture as less land, water, fertiliser and energy are used to grow equivalent quantities.
Successful delivery of the project objectives would allow further research in other crops and pests, increasing the value of the project.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>97041</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9C31A297-CEE6-4025-BAB3-10B06087FD65</gtr:id><gtr:title>Foundational and Translational Research Opportunities to Improve Plant Health.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Molecular plant-microbe interactions : MPMI</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/95948a503bb7000dc248921a2b19fc6a"><gtr:id>95948a503bb7000dc248921a2b19fc6a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Michelmore R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0894-0282</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a93f73fe66719.40076769</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/M011542/2</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:parents><gtr:parent><gtr:id>59B04DEC-70F4-4AD4-893B-ADCAF14F8BE9</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>BB/M011542/1</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>270483.22</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2014-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2017-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:children><gtr:child rel="Transfer"><gtr:id>886D1C76-07AF-45E7-924D-2A2769B1367D</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>BB/M011542/2</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>97041.24</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2017-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2018-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:children/></gtr:child></gtr:children></gtr:parent></gtr:parents></gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5B25B6A3-B218-4F11-8A9D-661236DF455C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agri-environmental science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>13975896-2E87-4DAA-99BC-E8D86B00B146</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Plant &amp; crop science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6F3E4891-E3E8-4568-94D8-075A0552DE90</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Crop protection</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8C69AA8D-0736-45EE-BA77-D6E60B4C9893</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Plant organisms</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
