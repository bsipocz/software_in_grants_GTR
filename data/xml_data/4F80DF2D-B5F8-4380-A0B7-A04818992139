It traces an important and previously unacknowledged shift away from attempts to reconcile urban pedestrianism with polite social interaction, to a new sense of urban aggressiveness. When we think of walking in the city, we tend to think of jostling crowds, sharp-elbowed commuters, and the perils of pickpockets, potholes, and puddles; we often assume that navigating the city on foot is a potentially hazardous undertaking. My book demonstrates how this sense of walking in the city as requiring one's absolute attention emerges in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries out of the tension between an ideal of the city and the everyday reality of dirt, noise, and crowds in the city's streets.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>While carriages and sedan chairs have long disappeared from London's streets, walking has endured as the predominant means for experiencing the city for urban dwellers and tourists alike. My research demonstrates how our modern sense of walking the city streets emerges in eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century London. No one has yet provided an account of how debates about the metropolis in this period have shaped our own sense of the city. My work highlights the extensive history of the familiar complaints about urban living as well as the rich tradition of imaginative proposals addressing questions of etiquette and personal space in London's streets. As a result, it enters into important dialogues with contemporary discussions about urban life. For example, proposals in 2000 for the establishment of a fast and slow pedestrian lane in Oxford Street that would ease congestion for Londoners on their daily commute have, in the context of my research, a surprisingly familiar feel, while accounts of pedestrians bumping into buildings, street furniture, and other walkers while texting are strikingly reminiscent of the claims about the problems caused by the new 'technology' of the umbrella when it became widespread in the late eighteenth century. \n\nThe output relating to this particular application for funding - a book on the representation of walking in London between 1700 and 1830 - is written with a broad readership in mind. In addition to the academic beneficiaries outlined in the previous section, my book addresses an audience of non-specialists who are interested in the representation of the city in different periods, and who might be especially interested in this topic at a moment when the city is being presented anew for both tourists and inhabitants in the run-up to the 2012 Olympics. In order to help reach this audience, I will be applying for a Publication Grant from the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art to help cover the cost of reproducing the numerous images essential to my discussion. This will help to ensure that extra costs are not passed on to my target audience. \n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-04-09</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-01-10</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>17616</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The research undertaken during the grant period has enabled me to consider the relationship between politeness and its others in representations of eighteenth-century London, including how an ideal of politeness is so often presented as being embattled or under pressure in representations of walking, the anxieties and concerns about social mixing in London's publications, and the physical and imaginative ordering and structuring of London's streets. 

The most significant achievement of the award was that it enabled me to draft the majority of my book on representations of walking in eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century London. I have continued to present aspects of this research at conferences in the United Kingdom and in North America, and have been invited to contribute my research as a respondent (Cityscapes: Media Textualities and Urban Visions Conference, April 2016), in research networks (Pedestrian Pathways in the Healthy City, a WUN network based at the University of Bristol), to journals (including Literature Compass and Journal of the History of Retailing and Consumption), to websites (the British Library's Transforming Topography webspace), and to edited collections (in addition to the Cambridge Companion listed under Outputs, I will also be contributing to a special issue of Studies in Romanticism). Most of these outputs are in progress. In addition, I have organized two roundtable sessions at the upcoming American Society for Eighteenth Century Studies annual meeting (March 2016) entitled &amp;quot;On Foot: Walking in the Eighteenth Century&amp;quot;. Because of the number and range of proposals I had for these sessions, I am putting together a proposal for an edited collection on the topic.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings are primarily of interest to a readership (academic and general) interested in eighteenth-century studies, and in representations of the city (and London in particular). The completed book will make a major contribution to our understandings of politeness in the period, and, because of its historical scope, help us to understand the continuities as well as the changes that occur in representations of the city between the eighteenth century and the early nineteenth century. Its contribution to knowledge will also be of interest to those working in museums and archives relating to the history and representation of the capital. The research I have undertaken has also provided a jumping off point for further research - a collaborative project with a colleague at another institution and with external partners - that will use one early nineteenth-century work (that is a map, guide, and commercial directory all in one) to consider representations of tourism and shopping in London within a long nineteenth-century framework.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>24C0B0D5-B818-4DC3-83B1-00EBFBAB74E9</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dc481b991308.51219641</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A56345A3-9AC3-489F-84CD-35DFFF8F46C7</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Cambridge Companion to the City in Literature</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/57daaceaa9481202d278e6fd653acae6"><gtr:id>57daaceaa9481202d278e6fd653acae6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>O'Byrne A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781107609150</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>544cc41060cee9.14450298</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>54BACD74-F287-4B0A-9F40-04B613078A1A</gtr:id><gtr:title>London and urban culture in eighteenth-century literature</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Literature Compass</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/57daaceaa9481202d278e6fd653acae6"><gtr:id>57daaceaa9481202d278e6fd653acae6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>O'Byrne A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5aa29282414d29.32588212</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I00100X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FB301405-099D-44B9-ADA9-75B11FDED8C0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>English Language &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
