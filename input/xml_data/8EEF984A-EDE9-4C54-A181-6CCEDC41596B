In order to make these collections more readily accessible to researchers in India and around the world, we are working towards a major project to catalogue and digitise all the South-Asian-language printed books published before 1914 - an estimated total of 11m pages, or 140,000 titles, in more than 22 languages.

In order to begin this project, and prepare plans for later phases, this pilot phase will focus on early printed Bengali books. These are a particular strength among the pre-1914 South Asian-language printed books held by the British Library, and many are unavailable in other library collections, or are extremely difficult to locate and access. This pilot project will catalogue and digitise 200,000 pages of early printed Bengali books, making them accessible to researchers everywhere. It will also use the catalogue information about, and the digitised images of, these books to undertake new research using digital humanities tools and techniques. Complementing the digitisation and research elements of the project will be a programme of skills-sharing and capacity-building, working with Indian institutions.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The Impact Summary gives more detail of the expected impacts of this proposed project. Taking each of the major project objectives in turn, we expect the impact of those to be:

Impacts of the project outputs listed above:
1. Researchers everywhere will be able freely to access the digitised Bengali books
2. Researchers everywhere will be able more easily to search the BL and SOAS Bengali collections
3. Workshops in India will develop skills and confidence in digitisation and digital scholarship in institutions there, supported by freely available training and reference materials 
4. Academic workshop will develop new lines of research, leading to new research collaborations and projects
5. The A&amp;amp;AC blog has an estimated 200,000 page views each year, and blog posts on this forum are an effective way of reaching very wide non-specialist audiences
6. BL website content reaches a very large and international audience
7. Researchers everywhere will be able to use the datasets to develop their own research, whether humanities or technological in focus, leading to new research questions and collaborations.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-03-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>950431</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>As part of promotion and fundraising for the Two Centuries of Indian Print project, we developed, organised and filmed a promotional video for the project which featured our Principal Investigator, British Library conservators and our Co-Investigators at the Shristi Institute of Art, Design and Technology and Jadavpur University.

The Co-Investigators, namely the Digital Curator for Asian and African Studies at the British Library and Digital Humanities expert at the Srishti Institute of Art, Design and Technology are both specialists in forming research questions around the historical analysis of data sets, in particular for both Bengali book history and the application of digital humanities methods to South Asian studies. The Co-Investigator at Jadavpur University is an expert on early printed Bengali books and the Bengali book trade, and has also made major contributions to the digital resources for the study of Bengali books and has supervised a number of PhD students and projects on early Bengali book history. The Principal Investigator and Head of the South Asian Section at the British Library brings knowledge of the British Library's South Asian early printed book collections, along with experience of managing large-scale complex projects across a range of teams and external institutions, including international partners. Our partner at SOAS, the Subject Librarian for South Asia and Development Studies, will work on the metadata and digitisation elements of the project, and bring to the team expertise in how academic researchers use the SOAS collection.

The skills of the PI and CIs will be complemented by project staff, including a specialist Project curator, who will provide linguistic expertise in Bengali language and the history of publishing in Bengal, a Digital Curator, who will focus on digital scholarship and have a more technical background, and a Post-Doctoral Research Assistant at Jadavpur, who will provide further historical context and research on the early Bengali book trade, as well as expertise concerning current trends in research on this topic in academic institutions in India. 

A number of engagement and skills sharing activities have been delivered and are planned for the project. These are listed below.

Engagement - Research/Scholars/General Public

In November 2016 a series of three seminars were held in the Library on related South Asian subjects, engaging scholars and researchers and the general public interested in South Asian material in the Library and beyond. These seminars were on diverse subjects like musical performance and women, the history of the culinary world of Mughal elite, and the 'High' and 'Low' of the farce in Colonial Bengal. IMPACT: These were very well attended and a further set of seminars have been organised from February through to April 2017, with more researchers and key people in South Asian studies coming forward to chair, present and participate. 

As part of our community engagement we contributed to a series of three successful outreach workshops with local members of the community and grassroots community groups and organisations. IMPACT: These were very well attended and the local attendees enjoyed engaging personally with the objects at the British library that were part of their cultural heritage. More community engagement sessions will be organised.

The project team continued to hold 'show and tell' sessions of South Asian collection items with attendees from the SOAS History of Heritage in South Asia, as well as a group of MPs from the government of India on 10 November as part of the 2016 Chevening Parliamentarians' Fellowship Programme, and various philanthropic engagement. In London, the Project Manager presented the project at the National Committee for Information Resources on Asia (NACIRA) conference at the Nehru Centre in London. IMPACT: we received good feedback, widened our network of engagement and contacts, with the ultimate objective of securing promotion, publicity and further funding.

Skills - Sharing

Digital Workshops 

The Principal Investigator, Project Curator and Digital Curator and Co-Investigators and Post-doctoral researcher at Jadavpur University held the first of three Digital Workshops at Jadavpur University in Kolkata. The workshop examined how to plan digitisation workflows, digital preservation and metadata standards, and digital humanities research methods, and was attended by 27 library and information professionals from a wide range of cultural heritage institutions in Kolkata. IMPACT: Promoting and developing skills-sharing - we received positive feedback from the participants and ideas on what to feature in the next seminars

While in India the project team presented talks at the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts, the National Museum in Delhi, and took part in presentations and panel talks at the International Conference on Digital Libraries in Delhi which were attended by more than 50 delegates and live streamed around the world. The team built links and met with other cultural institutions while in India and Bangladesh including, the Bengal State Archives, Sreerampore Public Library, the Minister of Culture in Bangladesh, the Bangla Academy, Asiatic Society of Bengal Library, Dhaka University Library, National Library and the Archives, and the British Council. IMPACT: Ongoing work, but these go a long way to helping secure promotion, publicity and further funding. Key links were made in Bangladesh, and the team will keep all groups informed on the projects progress.

The Head of Collections and Curation at the British Library, and the Principal Investigator also met with the Indian Ministry of Culture and Tourism on the project's skills-sharing programme, confirming plans for a series of skills sharing and capacity building workshops in 2017 including a series of programmes of workshops and placements at the British Library providing opportunities for earlycareer researchers and librarians from Indian institutions to spend time in the British Library, working on research and digitisation projects and learning from other library teams by collaborating across the library. IMPACT: Through the organisation of capacity-building workshops and an academic workshop, the interdisciplinary project team will have opportunities to work closely together, and to build networks and collaborations with archivists and librarians in the UK and India. This combination of a variety of academic and professional backgrounds will lead to fruitful exchanges and expand the remit of the field of digital humanities to encompass South Asian data sets, languages, and histories, to create a more global remit for the digital humanities. All of the project outcomes, from enhanced catalogue records, to digital images, to workshop training materials and academic outputs, will be shared freely on the project website, thereby disseminating this information globally.

Digital outcomes:

In the research strand of the project, the team will analyse the metadata produced for the Bengali books digitised in the first strand of the project, and metadata for books in the SOAS library collection. The BL project team will collaborate with academics in the field of Digital Humanities to explore how theses bibliographic records can be analysed, and how these datasets might allow researchers to pose new questions innovate new digital humanities research methods in the field of Bengali book history. 

For the first time the project has made freely available in digital format the Library's collection of Quarterly Lists. These are descriptive catalogue records of books published quarterly and by province of British India between 1867 and 1947. The Quarterly Lists are available to download as searchable PDFs via the British Library's datasets portal, data.bl.uk. 

Our Digital Curator has put together a project page: http://www.bl.uk/projects/two-centuries-of-indian-print and is putting together the permanent exhibition space that will link to the scanned items and host the blogs, podcast and further resources on the project.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>1A25CA6A-B2F5-4E3F-8BC9-B7EAD667575E</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>58a1cdab568cc2.30192051</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The first phase of the 'Two Centuries of Indian Print' project received its funding and began in March of 2016 with the creation of a project team and digitisation workflows and will finish in April of 2018, when the final research output will be made available online. The project is still in progress and although our main findings will be more quantifiable near the end of our funding period, we have been able to identify significant and valuable achievements at this stage toward the ultimate goals of the project. The primary stated aim of the project is to research and digitise a collection of 1,000 early printed Bengali books, which are unavailable or difficult to locate in other library collections, or are extremely difficult to access. The pilot will catalogue and digitise at least 200,000 pages of early printed Bengali books, making these images accessible to researchers everywhere. By cataloguing, preserving, and digitising the British Library South Asian language printed collections from 1713 to 1914 through the 'Two Centuries of Indian Print' project, the British Library will give access to this unique resource to researchers around the world for future generations. Identified by scholars as key to their research, the British Library South Asian language collections are currently only available to those that can visit the British Library Reading Rooms. 'Two Centuries of Indian Print' will open up these collections to researchers worldwide. The collections extend across the humanities and social sciences and limited physical access to these has meant that they have remained a relatively untapped resource both for researchers and a general audience. By digitising these collections the British Library will play a unique role in contributing to the world's knowledge base by unlocking their contents to the widest possible audience, whilst at the same time, enhancing standards in cataloguing, metadata and imaging. This newly digitised collection will serve as the foundation for the research strand of the project, which will investigate ways in which the digital outputs might be enhanced to enable large scale data analysis as is undertaken within the Digital Humanities (DH). Working in close collaboration with the School of Cultural Texts and Records (SCTR) of Jadavpur University, the South Asia Institute at SOAS, as well as with the National Library of India, is essential to developing the foundations for a digitised Bengali Print corpus suited to the needs of the modern scholar.


The key findings that we have identified through our digitisation efforts so far to date are:

? We are on target to meet our main objective of digitising our rare Bengali collections: 
1. The project has digitised 210, 707 images (roughly 500 books) so far, which exceeds the number of digitised images promised in our initial grant proposal. 
2. The project has digitally scanned the Vernacular Tract series of books in all South Asian languages, comprising 702, 607 images so far, and work to digitise this series continues.
3. In addition, the project team have digitally scanned the of Quarterly List series, generating 82,000 images and making the scans available freely on-line.

? Identifying rare or scholarly significant treasures in our 1000 rare Bengali books, which include: 'Directions for a Railway Traveller' (Bengali Title: Basapi?a Ratharohidgera Prati Upadesa - Shelfmark 279.36.D.29), by Aksa?akumara Datta, published in 1854 by Tattvabodhini Press, Calcutta, which contains information on the rules and etiquettes of travelling for the steam train traveller, in what is very likely one of the first books published on the railway for the newly introduced railways in South Asia, of great interest to social historians of the Subcontinent. This also contains a pull-out timetable for different stations and fares for different classes. A further rare work identified as part of the South Asian book history research strand of the project one of the very first Bengali cookbooks, 'Bya&amp;ntilde;jan Ratnakar', by Munshi Mahammadi, Golam Rabbani and Durgananda Kabiratna (Shelfmark VT 1852). This is a cookbook that was written at the instruction of, and financed by Mahatabchand Bahadur (1832-1879), the Maharaja of Burwdan. It was published in 1865 by Satyaprakas Press, Burdwan and contains recipes on different sort of breads, meats, pulses, mustard and rice-based dishes. A further work that has been recently identified and brought to the attention of scholars of South Asian social history is entitled, 'Instructions for Modelling and Conducting Schools,' or Pathsala Basaibara o Balakdera Siksaibara Dharara Bibara?a (Shelfmark: VT 1712), which contains detailed instructions of how to plan and design schools and classrooms and conduct classes for young children. It was written by J.D Pearson, a Christian Missionary of the London Missionary Society, published in 1827 by the Calcutta School Book Society. These works were previously not searchable through our electronic catalogue, and had not been brought to the attention of researchers in the relevant fields. As a result of the project research findings so far, these and other works have been presented in both academic seminars and public outreach events. 

? For the first time the project has recently made freely available in digital format the library's collection of Quarterly Lists. These are descriptive catalogue records of books published quarterly accordingly to province in British India between 1867 and 1947. The Quarterly Lists are available to download as searchable PDFs via the British Library's datasets portal. These have been welcomed as a much needed and unrivalled resource to explore the kinds of material that was being published at the time, and the wealth of information gathered on each book in the catalogues will be invaluable to researchers both in the digital humanities and South Asian book history. 

? Our Digital Curation team have had their proposal for a Bengali OCR challenge at the International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR2017) conference accepted, and work is on-going to prepare for this. The team is also continuing to work with a variety of external partners, including Google, to explore Bengali OCR solutions. The team are at the forefront of efforts to find a solution to OCR for Bengali and a solution to the OCR challenge for Bengali script will be invaluable to researchers around the world, and will open up solutions to OCR for other South Asian languages. 

The project is has brought together an interdisciplinary team of specialists in digital curating, data analysis and the digital humanities as well as in the history of the languages and scripts of South Asia. These experts are collaborating and sharing their knowledge of the British Library's South Asian early printed book collections to produce a series of conferences, workshops and on-line resources about the Bengali collections that are currently being digitised, catalogued, and made available on-line. The Project Curator, Cataloguer and Post-Doctoral researcher are bringing linguistic expertise in Bengali language and the history of publishing in Bengal, and providing further historical research into the early Bengali book trade, as well as expertise concerning current trends in research on this topic in academic institutions in India. They are currently researching and writing the content for the web resource that will provide global access to information and historical context for the Bengali collections that are in the process of being digitised and uploaded on-line. 

So far the project team have delivered a number of engagement and skills sharing activities which include: 

? In autumn of 2016 a series of seminars were held in the Library on subjects related to the history of the book in South Asia, engaging scholars and researchers as well as the general public interested in South Asian material in the British Library and beyond. These seminars were on diverse subjects drawn from the British Library's South Asian printed and manuscript collections, touching on topics from musical performance and women, the history of the culinary world of Mughal elite, and the history of the genre of 'Farce' in Colonial Bengal. This seminar series was very well attended and a further set of seminars have been organised from February through to April 2017, with more researchers and key people in South Asian studies coming forward to chair, present and participate, with podcasts available on our web page. These are important in bringing together like minded scholars and researchers to discuss and engage with the South Asian collections at the British Library and the project as a whole. Podcasts from the seminars have been uploaded to the Two Centuries of Indian Print project webpage, hosted in the BL's site.

? As part of our community engagement we contributed to a series of three successful outreach workshops with local members of the community and grassroots organisations. These were very well attended and the local attendees enjoyed engaging personally with the objects at the British library that are part of their cultural heritage. These are important in highlighting our collections to our communities locally and stimulating engagement with the South Asian collections at the British Library and the project as a whole. More community engagement sessions will be organised for the coming year, as this aspect of our work is continuous and on-going.

? The project team continue to hold 'show and tell' sessions of South Asian collection items with attendees from the SOAS History of Heritage in South Asia, Museum Detox group, as well as several groups of MPs from the government of India as part of the Chevening Parliamentarians' Fellowship Programme, in addition to philanthropic engagement across a range of sectors and fields. These sessions have received excellent feedback, promoted the project and the work of the team, and widened our network of professional contacts across a range of sectors, with the ultimate objective of securing promotion, publicity and further funding.

Skills - Sharing / Digital Workshops 

? The Principal Investigator, Project Curator and Digital Curator and Co-Investigators and Post-doctoral researcher at Jadavpur University held the first of three Digital Workshops at Jadavpur University in Kolkata. The workshop examined how to plan digitisation workflows, digital preservation and metadata standards, and digital humanities research methods, and was attended by 27 library and information professionals from a wide range of cultural heritage institutions in Kolkata. These workshops will promote and develop skills-sharing - we received positive feedback from the participants and ideas on what to feature in the next seminars.

? While in India the project team presented talks at the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts, the National Museum in Delhi, and took part in presentations and panel talks at the International Conference on Digital Libraries in Delhi which were attended by more than 50 delegates and live streamed around the world. The team built links and met with other cultural institutions while in India and Bangladesh including, the Bengal State Archives, Sreerampore Public Library, the Minister of Culture in Bangladesh, the Bangla Academy, Asiatic Society of Bengal Library, Dhaka University Library, National Library and the Archives, and the British Council. These early bridge building activities will go a long way to helping secure promotion, publicity and further funding. Key links were also made in Bangladesh, and the project will keep all partners and stakeholders informed on the projects progress.

? The Head of Collections and Curation at the British Library, and the Principal Investigator/Head of South Asian Collections also met with the Indian Ministry of Culture and Tourism on the project's skills-sharing programme, confirming plans for a series of skills sharing and capacity building workshops in 2017 including a series of programmes of workshops and placements at the British Library providing opportunities for earlycareer researchers and librarians from Indian institutions to spend time in the British Library, working on research and digitisation projects and learning from other library teams by collaborating across the library. Through the organisation of capacity-building workshops and an academic workshop, the interdisciplinary project team have had opportunities to work closely together, and to build networks and collaborations with archivists and librarians in the UK and India. This combination of a variety of academic and professional backgrounds has led to fruitful exchanges and expanded the remit of the field of digital humanities to encompass South Asian data sets, languages, and histories, to create a more global remit for the digital humanities.

Our public seminars, capacity building workshops in the digital humanities, blog posts, podcasts, and community outreach has reached a wide audience both in India and the UK, both amongst academics and the general public, that has promoted knowledge of our project, collections and research that can be used for future collaborations and research into our Bengali collections at the British Library

The results of our Bengali OCR challenge will contribute to the field of developing OCR technologies, and can be taken forward by anyone who is working on the development of OCR technologies for scripts that bear a similarity to Bengali. 

Our digital images and catalogue records that we are currently creating, once they have been made available on-line, will allow researchers anywhere in the world search and view our Bengali collections, thereby opening up access to our collections, and allowing researchers to take this information forward in form of their own research projects. Access to the digital images will also benefit members of the general public who are interested in the cultural and literary heritage of Bengal, including artists and writers. Free digital access to these collections will also be of benefit to Bengali-speaking diasporas in the UK elsewhere, who could integrate both the contextual and historical information provided by the web resources, as well as the digital images of books, into their teaching, outreach, and cultural programming.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>606093F2-EDEA-42EC-A342-B56BCE6EA8F3</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58b98d95eda834.22333876</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www.bl.uk/projects/two-centuries-of-indian-print</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The Two Centuries of Indian Print project at the British Library has digitised and made available searchable scans of its collection of bound volumes of Quarterly Lists.

The project is digitising 4,000 books and this will be a huge tranche of work in cataloguing historical South Asian material.</gtr:description><gtr:id>AE206917-2882-4BD7-9DE6-76A3B402DEC9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Creating and enhancing catalogue records as part of this project will be a huge and valuable resource for the British Library and historical collections, aswell as being very valuable for the project team and wider researchers who could explore how these bibliographic records might be combined, and analysed, and how they might, if visualised both temporally and spatially on historical maps, allow researchers to pose and answer new questions in the field of Bengali book history. This will be valuable to the field of Digital Humanities in South Asian Studies, with a view towards developing new models for the provision of such digital materials, and especially in support of large scale analysis.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58a48eb6b41b91.31620561</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Two Centuries of Indian print - Catalogue records</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>The Digital Curator for the project has submitted a successful proposal for a Bengali OCR challenge at the International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR2017), and work is ongoing to prepare for this.

The Quarterly Lists are printed catalogue records of books published quarterly and by province in British India between 1867 and 1947. The catalogues are predominantly in English language with some Bengali and mostly arranged in table format, capturing descriptive metadata about the books, including the names and addresses of printers and publishers, the number of copies printed and often the price, as well as further information. The project also hopes to make these lists available as ALTO XML files in the near future and will be digitising rare Bengali books dating from 1713-1914 in 2017, the datasets of which will also be made available through the BL Labs website: https://data.bl.uk/twocenturies-quarterlylists/</gtr:description><gtr:id>A4DBE9FF-9626-4F75-A007-E5630896D2B6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The collection has been advertised and is being used by researchers globally on the BL labs dataset, which is a very valuable resource for digital research on South Asian book history, made available on-line for the first time.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58a1b0f0892371.04019134</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Quarterly lists on BL.Labs</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/N00888X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DB058E35-DBAD-4B21-B030-5C3C78825B11</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Area Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>9DD86EE2-EE6B-432E-AEE0-0C8669A1CBB0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Library &amp; information studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8E63C4A9-31AC-4950-BF4C-643F945B707F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Asian &amp; Middle Eastern Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DCE73056-5E3D-4976-B573-234E5FF4D633</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic &amp; Social History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>699D8438-2A43-4BCF-B1A4-6240ED82CEEE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Communication in ICT</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5678A899-0926-491B-8E52-E55211E3F83B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>ICT and education</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B632CFBB-6635-4F38-88DD-292BBE071B00</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Library Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>C11BDEA9-7D9D-4728-B6A9-31032921B328</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Newton</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
