This ground-breaking interdisciplinary study examines British and American spiritualist literature from the mid-nineteenth to the early-twentieth century, focusing on its fascinating ideological and aesthetic endorsement \nof eugenic thought and hard hereditarianism long before these ideas entered the cultural and literary mainstream. The book asks why ideas about rational reproduction, hereditary determinism, and race improvement, became so important to spiritualist novelists, journalists, and biographers in this period; It also examines how these scientific and social concerns drove emerging spiritualist definitions of the aesthetic. In taking up these questions, Determined Spirits urges us to rethink the long-established and, I argue, outdated assessment of modern spiritualism as a site for the imaginative emancipation of individual identity from the dictates of the physical body. It builds on the momentum of recent scholarship on spiritualist writing and science while analyzing the relationship between the two in a wholly new light.\n\nThe monograph opens with a contextualizing discussion of transatlantic spiritualism's literature, history and body politics. Born in the United States in the late eighteen forties and then spreading rapidly throughout the globe, modern spiritualism held that human beings not only retained their individual identities after death, but were also capable of contacting the living with inspiring messages about the wondrous and non-punitive afterlife in which they now lived. Far from confining themselves to debates about the end of life, nineteenth-century spiritualist writers were also obsessed with life's origins, seeking in their Utopian faith a formula for regenerating the human race. They used their fiction, biographies, and journalism as platforms from which to imagine and argue for spirit-directed match-making,for improved physical and sexual fitness, and for religious and legal prohibitions against the reproduction of the so-called 'unfit.' My book traces the emergence of these ideas across a wide variety of rare and largely unstudied spiritualist fiction, journalism, literary criticism, self-help literature, and channelled accounts of the afterlife. Its goal is to show how this spiritualist preoccupation with determinist social reform anticipated the ideological tenets of the twentieth-century's most notorious social application of bio-knowledge: eugenics. It builds its argument about spiritualism's eugenic mapping of the afterlife and of human deviance over the course of eight chapters, two of which- 'Dark S&amp;eacute;ance: Race, Primitivism, and Possession in Spiritualist Writing' and 'Criminal Man, Recidivist Spirits'- will be written during the period of my proposed AHRC fellowship. Once complete, my monograph will be poised to contribute not only to Victorian Studies scholarship, but also to research in the history of science, Disability Studies, and Victorian periodical studies. \n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In its interdisciplinary concern with the religious, scientific, and social construction of human bio-identity, my research has the potential to benefit a wide variety of users. These include the following groups: local heritage organizations, museums, and members of the public interested in spiritualist history; members of the general public interested in the traditions and cultural legacy of Victorian supernatural writing and spiritualist fiction; and local disability research, activism, and support agencies who wish to create a dialogue on attitudes towards disability within historical and contemporary faith communities. \n\nMy project uncovers neglected sources for, and creates a new analysis of, one of the most fascinating Anglo-American faith movements to emerge in the last two centuries and demonstrates its role in shaping the public reception of bio-knowledge and of intellectual disability. I describe its impact on the three groups identified above as follows: \n\n- My research on Victorian Glaswegian painting medium David Duguid will be of value to heritage organizations interested in documenting the city's history of spiritualism. I plan to host a panel discussion on this topic at the People's Palace museum in Glasgow in the autumn of 2010 involving fellow researchers of spiritualism and, if possible, current members of Glasgow's one hundred and fifty-year old spiritualist church who could provide an oral history of the movement's local dimension. As the city's leading museum of working-class life, the PP would be the ideal venue for a discussion of this proudly plebeian heterodox movement. I would also like to use my research on social reformer Robert Owen's eugenic spiritualism as the basis for a public talk on spiritualism and socialism at the New Lanark heritage site in Autumn 2010.\n\n- There has been a large recent surge of interest in Victorian supernatural literature and in the spiritualist writing of Arthur Conan Doyle over the last several years; my research on this topic led to my involvement this spring in a BBC Radio Scotland entitled The Lost World of Arthur Conan Doyle. I plan to build on my role as a Doyle expert by writing a review article (targeted ideally at The Guardian or TLS) on Doyle's spiritualist novel The Land of Mist (1926) to coincide with the centenary of its protagonist Professor Challenger's creation in 2012. \n\n- My research on the emergence and consequences of what Nancy Eiesland terms the 'sin-disability conflation' in Victorian and Edwardian spiritualist thought will contribute towards the efforts of activists, researchers and community members working to make sure that faith communities remain receptive and non-ableist spaces for people with disabilities. I am interested in organizing a workshop on faith, eugenics and disability in conjunction with the C-Change for Inclusion and the local council, one that would build on my experience in organizing similar events through the 'What Sorts of People Should There Be?' network in Canada. I'd like to arrange this for the spring of 2011 when I'll be on department-funded leave.\n\n- I have already been in touch with researchers Dr Jenny Bann (Department of English Language, University of Glasgow) and Dr Sarah Edwards (English Studies, University of Strathclyde), both of whom are very interested in contributing to a panel discussion on spiritualism in Glasgow. I will contact Dr Peter Lamont (Lecturer in Psychology at the University of Edinburgh) over the next few weeks to solicit his participation. After doing so, I will approach Martin Bellamy at the People's Palace about hosting a panel discussion at the site. I have already approached Lorna Davidson, Deputy Director of the New Lanark Trust about an event at New Lanark and we are discussing ways to take my proposed talk forward.
