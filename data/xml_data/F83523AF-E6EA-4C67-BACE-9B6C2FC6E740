Destructive Application of the Life Sciences</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/K011308/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>It is well established that policy agendas define and construct what counts as a concern (Majone 1989). Yet, what remains outside of professional and policy agendas is equally an issue of importance. 'Strategic surprise', for example, is a recurring hazard for those attending to the security implications of science and technology (S&amp;amp;T). Yet, why and how some topics are ignored are questions amenable to social sciences and humanities inquiry. 

This project seeks empirically and theoretically to assess what is *not* taking place in relation to the analysis of the implications of science for security. It will study what is not taking place in different case studies related to the potential for life science knowledge and techniques to serve destructive purposes. Through doing so, the project will consider how such cases can inform other studies of emerging areas of concern and how they can inform empirical social research in general. 

A number of questions that address themes of ethical blindness, taken for granted assumptions, and the social basis of assessments will be central to this project, including: 
* How, for who, between whom, and under what circumstances have some applications of science become rendered non-issues? 
* What are the everyday routines, practices, social structures that shape this process? 
* How have scientists, diplomats, security analysts, and others fostered attention to or distanced themselves from applications of their work?

In relation to Global Uncertainties Programme's goals, this project asks how a diverse range of expertise can be brought together in a systematic fashion to address practical dilemmas associated with openness and collaboration in science. Consideration will be given to how perceptions of S&amp;amp;T and its implications for defence and security vary across professional communities, regulatory regimes, and national contexts. The specific concern with the hostile application of the life sciences examined through the interdisciplinary programme of inquiry outlined in this application will serve as a springboard for addressing what is left outside professional and policy agendas. The ultimate impact anticipated from this project -- as also demonstrated by the activities set out in the 'Pathways to Impact' section -- is to support efforts to prevent the malign use of life sciences and, thus, ensuring S&amp;amp;T work to improve human security.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>PROFESSIONAL ORGANISATIONS and NGOs - In recent years, national science academies, NGOs, and other third sector organizations around the world have been considering the nexus between research and future threats for the spread of disease. Through the international research set out as part of Phases 2 and 4, the applicants will be able to partake in and inform existing national and international initiatives to foster science and technology while also preventing the life sciences from becoming the deaths sciences. 

PUBLIC SECTOR BODIES AND OTHER POLICY MAKERS - Over the last decade, concerns about the deliberate spread of disease have risen within the agenda of governments as well as inter-governmental agencies such as the World Health Organisation. This is evident from the topics at meetings of the Biological Weapons Convention since 2003 that have included laboratory biosecurity, codes of conduct, and the education of life scientists. As part of the 2011 Review Conference of the BWC, States Parties agreed to monitor and consider responses to the implications of science and technology for the convention. This work will be able to feed into such deliberations (both during the funded period as well as beyond given the long term agendas of the applicants) through examining their commitments and limitations. 

In addition, The Blackett Review &amp;quot;High Impact Low Probability Risks&amp;quot; made a number of recommendations pertinent to the themes of this application. The Blackett Review called for fresh thinking with regard to the review, assessment and communication of risks. The unwillingness or inability of experts to consider scenarios which fall outside their community, professional and individual 'comfort zones' was identified in the review as leading to the rejection of potential concerns. Moreover, concern was expressed for which risks experts struggle to recognise. 

This project will address these themes by providing how issues are identified as matters of concerns in the first place and (the advantages and limitations of) how they become formulated as problems in need of redress. In this way, the project will seek to benefit decision-making about the high impact but low probability risks associated with the destructive use of the life sciences. It is anticipated this will be achieved by providing users with concepts and analytical frameworks as well as aiding in the identification of problems hitherto marginalised. In addition, throughout the various phases of the project, the applicants will bringing together a wide range of academic expertise - far beyond those traditionally working about defence and security - to understand the governance of risks.

RESEARCHERS IN THE LIFE SCIENCES - The empirical work envisioned will provide a mechanism for engaging directly with practicing researchers and advanced students. As a result, researchers' own understanding of the implications and uses of their work will be enhanced as well as their professional awareness. 

RESEARCHERS OUTSIDE OF SECURITY RELATED FIELDS - The international symposium in Phase 2 will bring together leading edge researchers from various fields and organisations to examine how and what is given attention in social and ethical research. This will enhance the quality and scope of research by sharing methodological lessons about a difficult, pervasive, yet arguably marginalised matter in empirical studies: what is not being studied.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>209291</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Stanford University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Megan Palmer</gtr:description><gtr:id>021248D3-500A-4DBB-8DDB-18A0A3A7B162</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was a multidisciplinary collaboration.

Taking the work of this project forward, Malcolm Dando is currently involved in a project financed by Canada and the UK to produce a multi-author textbook dealing with the question of dual-use (biosecurity outside of the laboratory) for life science students as well as practitioners. The textbook has been available free on the web in multiple languages since the autumn of 2015. The results from the project were also presented at a meeting of an EU funded project on biosecurity for culture collections in December 2014. Members of the EU project had already produced a code of conduct and Dando presented the ideas gained on the project in regard to how education might best be developed to sustain the effective implementation of the code. The presentation was followed by an extended lively discussion of the implications for the educational process they wished to design and implement.

The research undertaken on the shifting concerns about genetic engineering and biological warfare have used to help people in the arms control community understand the historical context within which arms control takes place. Three user related talks were given by Balmer (including the Dstl and the Biological Weapons Convention) and a policy briefing will be published in the next Yearbook of Biosecurity Education. 

Following from user engagement activities, the Nelson Mandela Foundation (NMF) has agreed to fund the material costs, production and installation costs for an exhibition on based on the work of Dr Gould and Rappert. NMF will host the exhibition for six months in the second half of 2016 and early 2017. Rappert and Gould will undertake consultative activities to generate ideas for the content and design of the exhibition. It will be interactive and encourage and enable visitors to explore documents and materials relating to the CBW programme we have assembled to date. They are also planning to develop on-line interactive archive based in part on the ESRC project that will serves as a resources for science and medical organisations and individual practitioners (for instance, as part of ethics provisions required for Continuing Professional Development courses) as well as activists, analysts, and functionaries in the fields of transitional justice, visual art and archives. 

After Evan's presentation at the Biological Weapons Convention Meeting of Experts, he had an extended conversation with a member of the US delegation about the rollout of the US DURC policy. His set of recommendations for where funding organizations might next focus their money on biosecurity work was highlighted as a key outcome of the US National Science Foundation workshop on 'Where next for social science engagement in synthetic biology', and will be published in the Journal of Responsible Innovation. His work integrating with the synthetic biology community has directly led to a new research project studying and contributing to an early career leadership training programme for broader community involved in synthetic biology (including regulators, NGOs, think tanks, scientists, and members of industry). This global programme will be run in the America in 2015, Britain in 2016, and an Asian country in 2017. He has provided substantive comments on the Wellcome Trust's Dual-Use Research of Concern policy. Evans' ongoing work with the international Genetically Engineered Machines (iGEM) student competition has contributed to substantial changes in the way teams approach and integrate the broader aspects of their research projects. He is also working with iGEM headquarters to further assess and strengthen their screening system for genetic sequences that may pose security concerns.

Evans has continued to assist in the design and operation of the International Genetically Engineered Machines competition's Security and Policy &amp;amp; Practices committees. He helped to redraft the requirements for teams to achieve awards, and how the team's projects were assessed for security concerns. Evans has also been working closely with CRISPR gene drive researchers to build, while still at the conceptual stage of development, broad practical engagement methodologies for bringing in a range of expertise to decide whether gene drive applications (the purposeful genetic modification of entire wild populations using minimal resources) should go ahead, and if they did, who should determine what the risks and benefits are. This has so far taken the form of a workshop held at MIT on 16 December 2015 for 35 people to discuss the specific application of a gene drive to immunize wild mouse populations on islands from getting Lyme disease (and thus preventing it in humans). Evans has been invited to co-author a paper (with Megan Palmer) for the Journal of Responsible Innovation special issue on the policy and security implications of gene drives, and will be presenting the paper during a US National Science Foundation workshop on this topic in February 2016. 

Evans also help run a Leadership Excellence Accelerator Program (LEAP) workshop with Megan Palmer at Asilomar from 14-19 June 2015. LEAP is a year-long development program for early- to mid-career leaders in government, industry, academia, and NGOs with an interest in synthetic biology. It seeks to provide fellows with mentorship, practical skills and a sustaining network to help them guide a socially responsible future for synthetic biology. In addition to being an advisor to the LEAP management, during this workshop, Evans conducted scenario-planning on how the projects that the participants were designing might come up against security regulations and concerns. He was also a reviewer for all action plans.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>77C5AA5C-A205-468D-B59B-8E92E68E0EDE</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5453b5bc8b1dc0.14940171</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>A central question pursued as part of this project was:
- How can those concerned with the implications of science and technology become more aware of the implications of what they are **not** addressing?
During Phases 1 and 3, varied streams of empirical research and analysis conducted by different project members were undertaken that produced a number of significant claims, including:

1. In examining how the failure of South Africa to declare its former chemical and biological warfare programme has become forgotten within national and international deliberations, this project has identified defensive self-reinforcing and self-sealing reasoning and practices within the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) and other disarmament forum that delimit what issues get discussed. As conceived by Brian Rappert and Chandre Gould, the ways in which the South African past programme non-declaration became a non-issues is just part of a much wider set of countervailing pressures and competing imperatives within the BWC that have negative consequences for international relations and weapon prohibitions. 

2. Another part of the project considered contrasting applications in human cognitive enhancement in neuroscience, both with regard to scientific developments and social and ethical commentary. Through project publications, Malcom Dando established grounds for why neuroscientists (and neuroethicists) should be concerned about such misuse of their benignly-intended work as well as how little they understand about this dual-use problem. As well in this project an attempt was made to further explore the reasons for the past difficulty of effectively engaging scientists on these matters and what might be done about it to improve the changes of effective engagement in the educational material on hostile misuse. Project members concluded that scientists can be encouraged attend to such issues through extending emerging ethical deliberations regarding way in which science is carried out (Responsible Conduct of Research) to include what is done with the results of research. 

3. Brian Balmer's case study of historical concerns about genetic engineering and biological warfare demonstrates that, although wider public debate had made links between the two even before the landmark molecular biology experiments of the early 1970s, this new science did not simply or immediately translate into a challenge to the BWC. Certainly, by the late 1970s, expert advice was being sought on the possibilities of a link but it was largely dismissed as both a present and future threat. In weighing up the extent of the threat, officials and experts considered not only the state-of-the-art of the science, but also whether the new techniques promised significantly different improvements that were sufficient to make them militarily attractive, and also the robustness of the BWC. 

4. Sam Weiss Evans' drew out the range of ways members of the synthetic biology community take care of security concerns in their work. Security-of the organisms, the researchers, the nation, and the environment-are generally warranted as needing attention, but the type of attention given to security concerns shapes what counts as a concern and an acceptable governance mechanism. Some ways of constructing security concerns, such as listing pathogenic organisms, lead to institutional blind spots, such as an inability to see security concerns in organisms whose pathogenicity cannot yet be determined. Other approaches to constructing security concerns, such as a broad-based dialogue on whether and how research particular applications should move forward, opens up who has a voice in this process, and are attempts to address the absences in extant institutionalized practices for defining and governing security concerns. However, there are significant roadblocks to the promotion and integration of these latter approaches in our current governance framework.

5. The agreed reconceptualization of Phase 3 examined why so few so-called 'dual use experiments of concern' has been identified to date. Rappert detailed how the low number of instances of concern stemmed from how the biosecurity dimensions of the life sciences are identified, how they are described, how the assessments of benefits and risks are undertaken, how value considerations do and do not enter into assessments, as well as the lack of information on the outcomes of reviews. It moved on from this to examine the limitations and implications of the risk-benefit experiment of concern framing, the politics of expertise as well as the prospects for alternative responses.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Corresponding to the streams of research noted in the box above: 
1. Through such reasoning, Gould and Rappert concluded that moving forward within the BWC in promoting confidence and transparency would require something else than just more discussion and time on the matters that have been discussed in the past (like Confidence Building Measure forms). They produced and have discussed with governmental officials and others (i) their understanding of the practices and conditions that rendered the South African CBM non-declaration (and other matters) a non-issue within the BWC and (ii) proposals for an alternative agenda for action that would address the underlying conditions that limit possibilities for achieving progress.

2. Dando's findings on the potential malign use of neuroscience are being taken forward mainly in considerations of the Biosecurity Education of life (and associated) scientists. Building on this project, he is currently involved in a project financed by Canada and the UK to produce a multi author textbook dealing with the question of dual-use (biosecurity outside of the laboratory). This has been specifically designed to engage undergraduate scientists through the use of Team Based Learning (a form of group based active learning) that should give them the confidence to engage in the societal debate and decision-making about what they should do and what should be done with their findings - including the governance of dual-use research. The textbook will be available free on the web in multiple languages in the autumn of 2015.

3. Of relevance to those involved in contemporary biological weapons control, Balmer's history of the past dealings with genetic engineering suggests that to focus only on the novelty of any science when judging threats could be myopic: a threat dismissed in one context might take on significance in a different historical context.

4. Evans' work on the structuring of security (non-)concerns in synthetic biology funding proposal processes has already been put to use restructuring the process used in two US institutions, the National Science Foundation's Synthetic Biology Engineering Research Center, and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Dual-Use Research of Concern (DURC) is a common way of framing security issues in biology, and Evans' has discussed the limitations of this framing with the Wellcome Trust in the development of their DURC policy, and also members of the US National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity. 

5. The analysis undertaken by Rappert questioned the continuing prominence given to conventional rationalistic &amp;quot;risk-benefit&amp;quot; assessment in managing the dual-use dimensions of the life sciences. In reply, he outlined policy measures based on acknowledging conditions of uncertainty, ignorance, and ambiguity in order to ask how issues can be sensibly approached nevertheless. Rappert elaborated how adopting such a starting basis could open spaces for alternative ways of thinking and methodologies for responding to a set of issues that are bound to uncomfortably accompany the life sciences into the future.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C1E528BF-B57D-45F0-903A-DD1853D8FD34</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5453cbb813f7e3.17082877</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://brianrappert.net/secrecy-absences/the-formulation-and-non-formulation-of-security-concerns-2013-2014</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>US Dual-Use Research of Concerns policy response</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>North America</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FA373BE1-CA64-4AA7-BA50-316EAE91C228</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54f2412c91f5c5.27586230</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://samuelevansresearch.org/main/2013/04/dual-use-research-of-concern-comments-on-the-us-governments-proposed-policy/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Wellcome Trust Dual-use research of concern policy</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C949893D-1F3E-46F5-B527-F0831E1BCFFE</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54f2422eef88b2.87692174</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Implementation circular/rapid advice/letter to e.g. Ministry of Health</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>As one component of our ESRC/AHRC/Dstl funded project under the Science and Society Programme (3/2013-12/2014), Brian Rappert (University of Exeter) and Dr. Chandr&amp;eacute; Gould (Institute for Security Studies) researched the former secret Apartheid-chemical and biological weapons programme (code name Project Coast) in order to understand how it has and has not been treated as an issue of concern by professional organisations and diplomatic proceedings. 
 
 As background, through the endeavours of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), an extensive legal trial, and various other investigations, the activities of the programme have become treated as emblematic of the perversities of a former time. And yet, each attempt to determine and remember what took place has been structured and delimited by the very investigations that enabled it. In short, our research has asked how the history of Project Coast is situated between revelation and concealment, remembering and forgetting, and the past and the future. 
 
 We undertook 18 interviews with 20 interviewees from government, civil society, professional associations and elsewhere to explore these issues. In 2 cases interviewees asked for no recording to be made of the interview and in 5 cases for the transcripts not to be deposited. In 1 case where an interviewee requested full anonymity, we determined it was not feasible to protect his identity if a transcript of the interview was deposited given his unique organisational role. The archive includes transcripts of the other 10 interviews.</gtr:description><gtr:id>67607223-78AC-4066-91F2-F3364F770280</gtr:id><gtr:impact>n/a to date</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54f2c05289c504.91666192</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Data Set - Project Coast</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://reshare.ukdataservice.ac.uk/851599/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>There is a set of interviews, images, reports, websites, and other media in an archive in the UK Data Service that provide a range of views on the ways to construct, govern, and make absent security concerns in synthetic biology.</gtr:description><gtr:id>C7716116-4425-4F48-A44B-10333C1BA74A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Conducting the interview with Megan Palmer sparked ideas for a future grant opportunity and publications, which we are now pursuing.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54f244f38097e5.75638444</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Media and Interviews Dataset - Security (non-)concerns in synthetic biology</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://reshare.ukdataservice.ac.uk/851699/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BFB237F7-8C12-4C7D-B83E-022D29F7B764</gtr:id><gtr:title>Why has Not There been More Research of Concern?</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Frontiers in public health</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/efcc259ee62364859128273c5c94081c"><gtr:id>efcc259ee62364859128273c5c94081c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rappert B</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2296-2565</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>54525a0361f5a3.20573302</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>EC2E312A-6680-4262-8B28-679B32BB1A4F</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Presence of the Past: Re-engaging the legacy of South Africa's chemical and biological warfare programme</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nelson Mandela Foundation News</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6d35089a338d9eb41d1d3c35e0e4c9ad"><gtr:id>6d35089a338d9eb41d1d3c35e0e4c9ad</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gould C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>54634b219533e2.01568537</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6632D7C0-284E-4DC5-B407-89D14367E867</gtr:id><gtr:title>Anomaly handling and the politics of gene drives</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Responsible Innovation</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ff0c0a4621ea8f02765340dba7993979"><gtr:id>ff0c0a4621ea8f02765340dba7993979</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Evans S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a677039c9e2b0.83719115</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4B2AE067-1F01-4CF1-AC84-BDE04EB53861</gtr:id><gtr:title>Synthetic biology: Missing the point.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nature</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2899df3a9a45e588a13d93bb0eb612cb"><gtr:id>2899df3a9a45e588a13d93bb0eb612cb</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Evans SW</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0028-0836</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>54f0d8889ee661.19417885</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>EFDB504A-DFD1-4681-9FF5-003D89D527F8</gtr:id><gtr:title>edited by Anique Hommels, Jessica Mesman and Wiebe E.
