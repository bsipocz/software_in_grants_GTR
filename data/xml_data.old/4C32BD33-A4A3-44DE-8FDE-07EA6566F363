The project will focus both on the aging population and on obesity and will seek to demonstrate the transitivity of the proposed solution both geographically (through 2 PCTS) and through application to different medical conditions. The partners include sensor manufacturers (e2v), home hub and communications specialists, digital community system providers (Imperial), mobile network operator(02), NHS Choices(Capita) digital health community specialists (Phrisk) and two primary health care trusts (Ealing and Hull).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>149093</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>User Trial of TotalCare Elderly Monitoring System</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AB5BF4A4-5292-40DE-BDDF-CBCDDE098B01</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A real world deployment and trial of the TotalCare home monitoring system took place at Rosemary House, a sheltered housing complex in Willesden after completion of the project organised by the start-up Forget Me Not. 
 A total of 16 residents and their carers, as well as 4 medical professionals, took part in the trial. 
Five sensors were installed in each dwelling, in the kitchen, bathroom, Living area, hall and bedroom.
 A web interface allowed the carer to examine patient movement in the dwelling according to room, time period, and relative frequency.


The outcomes were very encouraging. All trialists, both residents found the environment easy to ue and supportive. In the trial there were several episodes where the monitoring data revealed problematic activity that led to beneficial intervention. For example one resident was spending three to four hours on the toilet every evening. This turned out to be a gal; stone problem that was easily resolved


Of these, six trialists chose to use the TotalCare system beyond the end of the trial period. Further exploitation is now planned by Forget Me Not</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-5904819738.0311982b8c46c6</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Participants in your research or patient groups</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2011</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The outputs from tne TotalCare elderly-at-home monitoring system were taken up my Forget Me Not and installed and successfully trialed in a number of care homes and sheletered accommodations.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2006</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>3E4CAFDF-40B6-4EAD-84BD-47FE94884C62</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d5c1dcd783e9.70671458</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The TotalCare project developed and tested an infrastructure for the monitoring of the elderly living at home, This infrastructure was initially built on the results of the earlier TSB project, PEERSONA, that had developed &amp;quot;person server in the Cloud&amp;quot; infrastructure.



The developed infrastructure used simple Passive Infra-red Motion sensors and and focussed on the shared use of the monitoring data between the individuals and communities involved in the care of the elderly person - the carer, the health professionals, social workers and friends and associates.
