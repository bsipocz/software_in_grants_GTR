The proposal has been devised in response to an initiative by the Kuikuro Indigenous Association of the Upper Xingu (AIKAX) to create a regular programme of residencies for non-indigenous artists and scholars within the Kuikuro village of Ipatse in the Upper Xingu region of Brazil. A network of Brazilian and British partners (academic and non-academic) will support a pilot programme enabling AIKAX to establish good practices, measure impact and demonstrate the ways in which culture exchange can stimulate economic development and welfare in ways that are not destructive to the culture and languages that have historically sustained a way of life intensely related to the land which they preserve and by which they are preserved. 

By establishing a controlled experiment in cross-cultural exchange that is initiated by one of the tribes of the Xingu, the research seeks to forge new connections between indigenous culture and the broader cultural industries in Brazil in the acknowledgement that this is an important feature of a development agenda. The collaboration will bring expertise on the economic and welfare impacts of arts and cultural activity to an indigenous initiative in order to extend understanding of how cultural interaction, creative innovation and collaborative cultural production can be conceived and measured as essential to the wellbeing of communities and individuals. 

The protagonism of the Kuikuro in the conservation, sharing, interpretation, representation, use and exchange of their own culture is the baseline for this research. AIKAX was formed in 2002 to preserve and present the Kuikuro cultural heritage and has been an active agent in determining the production and display of ethical representations which respect the rights of individuals as well as sustain their villages as cohesive communities. The research will seek to contribute to the development of professional practice by indigenous societies that engage in initiatives that propose cross-cultural exchange as a means of socially purposeful development. The AIKAX proposal seeks to make indigenous artists and thinkers protagonists in a new process of knowledge-exchange, fully aware that their experience and expertise have significant value within Brazil's own search for more effective ways to understand how culture contributes to social welfare. 

By creating a model that enables the Kuikuro to be agents in the process of exchange rather than passive consumers of external influences or victims of cultural invasions, the research seeks to discover and promote new learning that will strengthen capacity and define the terms on which indigenous peoples can become protagonists in the creative industries in Brazil (and beyond) in ways that resist the 'predatory nature of the productive system'. The research will recognize the legitimacy of historic cultural forms but also allow indigenous artists and artisans to develop autonomous practices in contemporary exchanges, maintaining and developing cultural production that prioritizes the preservation of the human and natural environment that maintains the lives of individuals and the welfare of the community.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Governments and public sector: Initiatives to fund and support indigenous culture were incorporated into Brazilian public policy during the time of Gilberto Gil as Federal Minister of Culture (2003-8), ensuring that there is a growing movement of indigenous audiovisual artists who are producing a valuable archive of material documenting their own cultures. This well established work has not to date made successful inroads into national or international development policy. This research project seeks an innovative re-framing of cultural exchange, asking how the Kuikuro can use cultural exchange to engage with the idea of economic and social development without losing the myths and belief systems that are essential to their welfare. 

Third Sector: The 'Museum of the Indian' in Rio will engage with the project in an advisory capacity, sending a senior member of staff to shadow the exchanges and embed the learning from the project in their own research and public engagement. It is a strong possibility that the artistic outputs will be showcased at the Museum following their first showings at partner organisations.

Arts organizations: At least 7 Brazilian and UK arts organizations will be directly engaged in this innovative exchange programme, benefiting from the new understanding within their own practices and the comparative learning with other organizations engaged in parallel processes. Further arts organizations will participate in the 2 seminars and the research will be promoted widely across the arts sector in Brazil and the UK by PPP and the project's partners.

The media: The 2015 and 2016 visits of Takuma Kuikuro linked to the filming and premiering of his short film 'London as a Village' generated considerable media interest in Brazil and the UK, with newspaper profiles and TV news interviews in both countries. We anticipate that the new project will sustain this media interest.

Local communities: The research is focused on supporting the Kuikuro community to pilot a new model of cultural exchange that enables them to be agents in the process of exchange rather than passive consumers of external influences or victims of cultural invasions. The aim will be to achieve a successful model that leaves the community with the capacity to plan and deliver future exchanges, the infrastructure to host Brazilian or international artists as guests, a legacy of materials with which they can promote new opportunities, and an understanding and critique of the economic models that are commonly used in development and cultural tourism. In Rio and Belo Horizonte, a variety of local (Grupo Galpao) and hyperlocal communities (Agencia, Observatorio de Favelas) will benefit from the opportunity to make meaningful connections with indigenous people's lives and culture in a way that is still rare in urban Brazil.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>86852</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/P007708/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>020361E1-B8CA-49FD-9149-27D31D21C7A3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3367A4B0-EBD4-4FD9-8351-3A2F206BD2AF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Anthropology and Development</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8990E5FE-B44F-4A5B-8FDE-0610A5BE98C4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AE63480E-6C03-439A-99F3-2BBCEC64D6A5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Econ, Pol &amp; Env Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AD75E543-5F70-43C2-A40D-4452373465C4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Heritage Management</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1DB39325-6FA5-460A-B093-91A5EEF6EB97</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Bus Studies &amp; Dev</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>D640D1B8-B141-4DFC-BCD3-CEADD848A918</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>GCRF</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
