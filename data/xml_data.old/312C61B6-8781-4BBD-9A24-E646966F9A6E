The overall aim of the present project is to offer a way for school-children, students and interested members of the public to engage with a number of facets of Britain's medieval past, its language, manuscripts, and the clothing worn by the royal family and nobility. Specifically, the proposal is to offer an attractive and accessible entry point to the resources of the project Lexis of Cloth and Clothing in Britain c. 700-1450: origins, identifications, context and change (LexP). This was a major five-year research project that received funding from the AHRC in 2006 for a trans-disciplinary study with the purpose of collecting together the terms for medieval dress and textiles in use in the British Isles across the Middle Ages in the form of a searchable database, illustrated by images of clothing from manuscript art and statues.

A new entry point into the LexP will be provided through a website which will include brief descriptions and summaries of manuscripts of the Royal Wardrobe accounts for the reigns of Edward I, Edward II and Edward III. These are documents which record the textiles bought to make the clothing (manufactured in Britain or imported) and the garments that were made out of them, together with the costs and the payments to tailors, embroiderers, button-makers, etc. The summaries will be accompanied by an index to all words for cloth and clothing in the accounts and information about these words will be provided via links to the LexP database. There will also be links to records of cloth and clothing in Discovery, The National Archives' catalogue. The new project's website will also feature images of the manuscripts held in The National Archives so people can see the handwriting and gain a sense of the look of these medieval documents. In addition, the website will include an artist's impressions of the clothing described in the Royal Wardrobe accounts and images of the royal family, to compare the clothes worn by modern royals for state occasions with those worn in the Middle Ages.

A further aim of the project is to produce a guide to the clothing and textiles in the records held at The National Archives. This treasure store of manuscripts is freely available to the public, but again, an entry point is needed to make the information contained in the manuscripts accessible and to instil a sense of ownership in this heritage.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Impact Summary

The project aims to offer a way for school-children, students and the general public to engage with various facets of British heritage: its language, the documents of its medieval past, and the history of what the royal family wore for state occasions as well as who made the clothes and where the fabrics came from (manufactured domestically or imported). The project thus offers an accessible entry point to engagement with medieval documents and the original languages in which they were written. 

For many pupils, their encounter with the project will be enhanced by visits to their schools by members of the project team who will introduce them to the materials and set projects and activities which will follow up on their encounter with medieval manuscripts and handwriting. It is hoped that this will offer them a new way into the world of history and of books and, it is hoped in some cases, to visits to The National Archives to see the manuscripts for themselves: they may attend the exhibition at The National Archives or go on school outings.

There is evident public interest in the clothing and documentation about it that remain to us from Britain's medieval past, and these has proved a source of inspiration for artists, for example, the fashion designer, Juliana Sissons, whose residency at the Victoria and Albert's medieval and renaissance galleries resulted in her 2011 collection of knitted pieces inspired by the armour collection and images depicting armour in tapestries and sculpture. At present, the Magna Carta exhibition at the British Library is drawing record numbers - around 800 per day - and the artist Cornelia Parker will unveil a new work inspired by the Magna Carta in May 2015. The summaries of the Royal Wardrobe accounts and the artist's impressions on our project website will spur investigation into the documents and the sources of the words for the garments worn in medieval Britain.
 
There is a public appetite for information about the history of the English language and its vocabulary. The Lexis of Cloth and Clothing in Britain offers information about these and many other questions about the vocabulary of cloth and clothing in medieval Britain. It is also the first (only?) multilingual dictionary resource and offers its users an insight into the multilingual situation in medieval Britain which is still not part of the story of the history of English told in most standard textbooks on the subject. 

Historical Re-Enactment and Living History groups represent a worldwide movement. They include costume-makers who regularly make use of academic resources to ensure that the clothes worn by medieval characters are as accurate as possible. They are frequently hired by film, theatre and television producers as well as museum curators. The project's website will offer an accessible way in to the resources of the LexP which include a gallery of images from medieval manuscripts and art in addition to the database and to those of The National Archives.

A further aim of the project is to produce a guide on clothing and textiles in the records held at The National Archives, and The National Archives' Discovery catalogue will also be linked to the new project, and thus to LexP. The National Archives' holdings are free to visit: it is hoped that the project will help to make them seem more accessible and foster a sense of ownership in them in addition to the enhancement to the catalogues.

The RA employed on the project will receive training and gain experience of creating and maintaining a website; s/he will write blog posts aimed at the general public and so, under the guidance of the PI, will acquire the skill of turning academic research into accessible and user-friendly, informative prose. Additionally, research on the Royal Wardrobe accounts will undoubtedly form the basis of future research in palaeography, codicology, lexis or cultural history, depending on the interests of the RA.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-09-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>78925</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>The National Archives</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>The National Archives</gtr:description><gtr:id>51C1AB0B-4697-448C-A338-25399FDB838C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Exhibition</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>589c991610d102.59614355-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Provided expertise in selecting manuscripts for transcription; provided high-resolution images of manuscripts for the project website; hosted the exhibition and the launch of the project with a reception and display of manuscripts of the Royal Wardrobe accounts; advertised the project through their public website.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Surveyed the manuscripts of the Royal Wardrobe accounts held in The National Archives; transcribed selections from the manuscripts with hyperlinks to entries in the Lexis of Cloth and Clothing database; curated exhibition on display in the Keeper's Gallery December 2016-March 2017; designed and facilitated activities based on the manuscripts of the Royal Wardrobe accounts for a Family Day held at The NationalArchives; provided training in using the Lexis Project database, which has subsequently been used with school groups visiting The National Archives; will be contributing to a guide to medieval clothing in manuscripts held in The National Archives for public users.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Project Website (with Blog/Vlog)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>16123831-E948-43E5-B963-01F79ADAA038</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We have designed a new website to act as a gateway to the Lexis database.

In addition the website contains a schools section which showcases some of the work completed by the students during the project workshops. This also contains downloadable teaching resources for the use of teachers in secondary schools. The website also contains the project blog which features blogs and video blogs (vlogs) written by members of the project team and guest blogs by other researchers.

Feedback was collected through a Q&amp;amp;A session and questionnaires. Feedback made important suggestions including the use of more images for the presentations and producing clothing items to look at (both of which were acted upon for later workshops).

Students from six schools attended the event which was hosted at Moreton Hall School in Shropshire in cooperation with the head of History at that school. The workshop comprised of presentations and a number of interactive team activities (tasks) on the subject of medieval fashion - making use of the Lexis of Cloth and Clothing database. The students engaged well with the activities and participated enthusiastically throughout. The day closed with a poster competition in which the children got to design medieval outfits demonstrating what they had learned and using the Lexis database. Certificates were given to the winning teams and project bookmarks were given to all participants. Students and teachers filled in questionnaires which proved invaluable in improving the design of future workshops. Feedback also indicated an appreciation of the importance of language for studying the past - a topic which students had not considered before the workshop. Feedback was very positive and teachers expressed considerable enthusiasm for involvement in future events. Following on from the talk Charles Farris was contacted by the head of History at Moreton Hall School thanking him from the talk and asking for help with the work of one of his sixth form students.

The exhibition generated further interest in the project and use of the Lexis database.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bda23b9ee4d0.05424540</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://nationalarchives.gov.uk/about/visit-us/whats-on/keepers-gallery/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016,2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talk for the London Medieval Research Seminar (Royal Holloway, Bedford Square)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2F19D7C6-3976-44CB-8A3E-26761A4B61E3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In March 2016 project researcher Charles Farris gave a talk to the London Medieval Research Seminar based at Royal Bedford Square, led by Professor Caroline Barron. The audience comprised of academics, researchers and amateur historians. The talk explored the topic of medieval fashion and introduced the project and its database. The talk was well received and generated a lot of questions. Audience members were given project bookmarks and encouraged to contact the project with future questions. Following on from the talk Charles Farris received several emails about the database and answering them helped to advance the work of research students.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bd5b834c9831.91028302</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talk at Chalke Valley History Festival 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>800646AA-08FC-4755-994C-087413970F3D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Project researcher Charles Farris gave a talk at the Chalke Valley History festival in Wiltshire. The talk introduced the topic medieval royal fashion and how the Lexis project is investigating it. Feedback was gathered through a Q&amp;amp;A session and was extremely positive. Many listeners requested information about the project and took away project materials (including flyers and bookmarks) in order to learn more. This provided an to speak to, and answer the questions of, the general public as well as a large community of historical reenactors and medieval textile enthusiasts. These contacts proved invaluable when designing and making the clothes used in the school workshops.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b6bf88d95ba9.95226996</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>School Visits and KS3 Workshop (Durham)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>37D0ECE9-5F89-409D-9288-6DAE81142B73</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The team visited schools in the Durham area to present workshops entitled Royal Fashion in Medieval England. These workshops had been modified thanks to the feedback questionnaires collected at earlier events - reducing the duration of &amp;quot;talks&amp;quot; and increasing the group activities. Through a series of talks, group activities and competitions the students learned about medieval society, clothing and language. Throughout the workshops students used the Lexis database to complete tasks. Feedback was collected through questionnaires from students and teachers. Feedback was very positive and demonstrated that the students had found the events informative and engaging - however they suggested that they would like to &amp;quot;make&amp;quot; medieval clothes not just design them.Teacher feedback was also very positive - but suggested more costumes for the students to try on. This advice will be very useful in improving and designing future events.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b6ba56329e95.08575596</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Impact Talk at Postgraduate Study Day (IHR, London)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>32F04F98-D995-467A-816B-70FC1E8A40E4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In July 2016 project researcher Charles Farris gave a talk at the History Lab Plus, &amp;quot;Life After Your PhD&amp;quot; conference at the Institute of Historical Research, London.

Dr Farris' talk discussed academic impact exercise using the Lexis project as an illustrative example. The talk was well received and prompted live tweets which helped to promote the project - these also demonstrated audience engagement and interaction.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58bdaf255fb3e1.46374424</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/getting-grants-getting-published-and-staying-sane-life-after-the-phd-tickets-26232231310?aff=eac2#</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Key Stage 3 School Workshop (London)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>82CBE670-04BC-4F9B-9D59-DCAF6782A313</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In October 2016 forty Key Stage 3 students from a London secondary school attended a half-day workshop at the University of Westminster for a workshop entitled &amp;quot;Royal Fashion in Medieval England&amp;quot;. Students explored the subject through a series of interactive presentations and team activities using the Lexis Database. At the end of the day students demonstrated all they had learned by producing posters of a medieval outfit complete with annotations which described design,materials, what the clothing was for, who it was for and what it tells us about the person. Certificates were awarded to the winning team and project bookmarks were given to all participants. Student participation was outstanding and demonstrated interest, learning and understanding. Feedback forms demonstrated that the students had really enjoyed the activities and learned a lot from the day. Teacher feedback was also very impressed and expressed an interest in future events and using the database in teaching. Feedback was also very useful in continuing to refine the workshop structure for future events.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>589de0f24401f5.15432121</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The team has conducted a series of school visits/workshops which have enabled teachers and KS3 students to explore and learn about the topic of medieval history through the study of medieval fashion. Students have reported a greater understanding of the topic - especially the importance of languages and manuscripts for understanding the past. They have demonstrated an increased understanding of the origins of global trade; and the history of medieval England's cultural and linguistic diversity. Students have displayed a new understanding of the similarities and differences between medieval and modern society and the importance of exploring these themes. The positive reception and impact of the workshops has been demonstrated through questionnaires and also the feedback of teachers through letters and emails.The work produced by the students has been showcased on the new project website; at an exhibition at The National Archives; and at the project launch - also at The National Archives. In addition to the school workshops the team has produced a new website; given presentations and workshops to diverse audience both inside and outside of academia; and produced teaching resources which can be downloaded from the website for the use of secondary school teachers.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>9C66039D-8FBF-4A6F-A40C-EB0AD20ADAC5</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56bb41576f8cd0.45547811</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/N003357/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ABBA5192-0B16-4BC8-8B3F-3A48625872F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DCE73056-5E3D-4976-B573-234E5FF4D633</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic &amp; Social History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FB301405-099D-44B9-ADA9-75B11FDED8C0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>English Language &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>C52A4D58-78E0-4598-9ED6-DB919A085333</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History &amp; Dev. of English Lang</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>950E3601-19AF-48B8-9030-FB18B0E0FB1A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medieval Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
