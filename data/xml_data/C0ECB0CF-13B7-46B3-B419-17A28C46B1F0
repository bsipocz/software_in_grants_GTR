Running after, and walking under, the rainbow is a movement that is rehearsed in the work of two key Afro-Brazilian women writers, Carolina Maria de Jesus (1914-1977) and Concei&amp;ccedil;&amp;atilde;o Evaristo (1946-). The story compares the act of remembering to an impossible rainbow chase, which results in a bodily re-orientation away from classification (sex as social construction) and towards the unanticipated (identity as queer). Their engagement with the rainbow story forms the theoretical core of this project, which takes gender difference and queer identity as the key drivers for thinking about female mobility and memory making in the Brown (i.e., lusophone) Atlantic. 

In Brazil, the image of the rainbow is tendentiously associated with the Orisha Oxumar&amp;eacute;, the male-female snake-like God of movements and cycles in the Candombl&amp;eacute; Afro-Brazilian religion (Verger 2002), who holds the power to change people's sex. This project takes Oxumar&amp;eacute;'s symbol, the rainbow, arguably queerer than the rainbow flag of the LGBT movement, so as to revise the use of the archive metaphor and its historical complicity with the maritime. Rather than emphasising flows and crosscurrents, which typify existing theories of (queer) diasporic mobility, the rainbow story highlights a temporality (&amp;quot;running after&amp;quot;) that is queer because it points to the impossible location of memory and identity. In order to open up this wider research, the Fellowship will focus on the particularities of memory making processes of the &amp;quot;Brown Atlantic,&amp;quot; a term that names an African-based Atlantic cultural interconnectedness based on the infusion of Portuguese language, culture and blood (Almeida 2004).

In tackling black women's long-term omission from critical paradigms, the Fellowship considers the ways in which black female mobility in the Brown Atlantic has been remembered and imagined, in literature, by black women and white men. The innovative methodology will question sharply defined national, sexual and racial boundaries, favouring transnational ways of remembering and imagining movement. Furthermore, the emphasis on imagination will upset the linear patterns of the diaspora by exploring unpredictable, &amp;quot;blue skies&amp;quot; routes beyond origin-destination travelling. These correspond to routes of memory arising from serendipitous imaginary journeys that, in their refusal to be easily archived, render today's theoretical emphasis on space, archives and traceable movement accountable for their power over memory. Finally, by using the rainbow as a theoretical lens, the project will examine theories and cinematic performances that travel (literal travelling of people and ideas), and diaries, novels, short stories and letters (travelling of stories).

Research will be discussed with scholars from a variety of disciplines at international conferences and in the context of a scholar in residence programme to be inaugurated at Exeter. The output of a monograph, to be submitted to Palgrave MacMillan Press (Memory Studies series), will make a major contribution to studies of the Lusophone Atlantic and Afro-Brazilian literature. Collaborations with the Museu Afro-Brasileiro in Brazil and the N&amp;uacute;cleo Museol&amp;oacute;gico de Lagos in Portugal will lead to knowledge exchange and provide material for the development of a Video Book of Mobilities, an interactive Map of Mobilities and an artistic exhibition, designed for the wider public.

The project builds on my existing work on contemporary women's writing from Mozambique and Portugal, but enables me to undertake a substantially more ambitious interrogation of the relationship between lusophone nations by focusing on less visible processes of memory making across three centuries. Ultimately, it argues for the continued relevance of black female mobility to the history of the nations that make up the Brown Atlantic.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project is designed to ensure that local communities, artists, and museum curators not only benefit from its outputs but also contribute to shaping the project's methodology. Throughout the lifespan of the project, stakeholders will be actively engaged in the co-production of knowledge and the communication of its results. Impact will be approached through three strategic pathways: 1) collaboration, 2) communications and engagement and, 3) exploitation and application.

I will work collaboratively with two key institutions from the public sector, the Museu Afro-Brasileiro (MAFRO) in Brazil, and the N&amp;uacute;cleo Museol&amp;oacute;gico de Lagos (N&amp;uacute;cleo) in Portugal. With Ant&amp;oacute;nio Carrilho from the N&amp;uacute;cleo I will launch an Artistic Commission Opportunity (March 2018) with the goal of selecting a piece of original artwork relating to the project's theme for exhibition. With Gra&amp;ccedil;a Teixeira from MAFRO, I will organise a one day event (December 2018), comprising a public lecture followed by a workshop aimed at the local community. These two activities will generate accounts of mobility that will be recorded and incorporated into the research methodology. The material gathered will support the three planned public engagement outputs, which will be used to communicate the project's findings and engage the wider public: the Video Book of Mobilities (VBM), the Map of Mobilities (MM) and the artwork (ACO)(and accompanying booklet). These are designed to incorporate local stories of mobility shared during fieldwork and community events, thus benefiting local and transnational communities' sense of identity and connectedness. Finally, the oral and artistic material gathered will provide the story line for a subsequent documentary on Women of the Brown Atlantic, to be submitted to film festivals after the life cycle of the project. As such, the Fellowship has the potential of increasing impact for industry stakeholders and the general public, as well as widening public understanding of malitical issues such as memory of slavery, race, gender and sexual difference in Brazil. 

The VBM is a series of video shorts developed around central concepts to be chosen by the participants in the MAFRO event and narrated through their personal, professional/artistic experiences and memories. Panel adviser Margarida Cardoso, a renowned film director, and Antonia Eklund, the project's technical assistant/collaborator (TA/C), will help me to advance my skills in planning, filming and recording testimonies (Technical Plan). The MM, produced with the assistance of Richard Holding from Digital Humanities Lab (Exeter), is an interactive map that will provide visualizations of stakeholders' real and imaginary stories of mobility shared during the MAFRO event and fieldwork interviews. By presenting black female mobility outside the slave trade, it will create an alternative to existing slave voyages databases. This has considerable contemporary relevance, given the stereotypes that still associate black female identity with forced movement and domestic sedentary existence. The ACO will promote new artistic work on the legacy of slavery in the Brown Atlantic. As such it will foster public debate on issues relating to loss of memory about slavery and racism in Portugal, at a crucial time when ONU is investigating Portugal's levels of racial discrimination and its lack of specific policies aimed at Afro-descendant communities. 

My research and the pathways to impact will mark me out as a leading scholarly expert in the fields of the Brown Atlantic and Afro-Brazilian studies. As I have learned from experience of working with British actors and a Portuguese film director (New Portuguese Letters workshop 2015), and with a broader public audience (chefs, food writers, Afro-Brazilian UK migrants in the AHRC-CFF project) (CV), the underlying impact will extend beyond dissemination to stakeholders, providing new avenues for changing perceptions about the project's topic.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>201792</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/R004978/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DB058E35-DBAD-4B21-B030-5C3C78825B11</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Area Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4A856E02-8C94-4981-B572-E381EEB60DD2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Media</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>CB9410C5-3524-4683-9A7C-9A18853F6F6F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Film History, T &amp; C</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>67D06C0B-53E4-47FE-8186-CBCE56A1271E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Gender &amp; Sexuality</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>04B7A494-75A7-4241-9AA9-A7791BD4328A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Hispanic &amp; Latin American Stud</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9EFA3E9E-2186-4589-A542-814A214E3D57</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Hispanic, Portguese &amp; Latin</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9DFBE9F1-538E-4C96-B606-5163472E6960</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Literary &amp; Cultural Theory</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
