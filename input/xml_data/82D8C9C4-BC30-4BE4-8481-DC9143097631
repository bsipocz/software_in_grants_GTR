Is it wrong to eat meat or to have an abortion? Philosophers approach such concrete questions in two ways. Applied ethicists investigate these questions directly with the best analytic tools of philosophy. Normative ethics, in contrast, attempts to find general principles that could give the right answers to all ethical questions at the same time. Utilitarians, for example, suggest that we should always do whatever brings about most general happiness, whereas virtue ethicists claim that we should do whatever a fully virtuous agent would do in our shoes. 

We also ask more theoretical questions about morality, even in everyday life. We wonder whether moral claims can be true or whether morality is merely a matter of taste. Metaethics investigates this type of higher-order questions systematically. It focuses on three questions: 
- What do we mean when we say that an action is right or wrong?
- What kind of a mental state are we in when we make moral judgments like this?
- What is the nature of states of affairs that make moral claims true? Do rightness and wrongness of actions somehow depend on our judgments or culture, for example?

When answering these questions, metaethicists draw from the best theories in philosophy of language, philosophy of mind and metaphysics (the study of what there is). However, only few metaethicists think that they should study normative ethics in order to answer the central questions about moral language, thought and moral properties (such as rightness and wrongness). Likewise, normative ethicists rarely consider these more theoretical questions when they attempt to understand which actions are right and wrong. This is why these two fields tend to proceed independently of one another. 

Yet, there does not seem to be any good reasons for this. It is appealing to think that considering which actions are right and wrong should help us to understand the nature of our moral language and thought, and vice versa. In this case, those working in normative ethics should listen to metaethicists and metaethicists should learn from the normative ethicists. This is why investigating the connection between these two fields has potential for transforming both fields.

The research project will have two parts. These parts will be pursued simultaneously, even if the results of the first part will help to guide the second part. The first part will investigate how different philosophers have understood the connection between metaethics and normative ethics in the past. I will look at the attempts to show that the main views in metaethics do not have any consequences for what is right and wrong. These arguments have usually been put forward by those who defend the idea that moral language expresses our desires and emotions and by those who think that moral qualities of actions are of their own unique kind. I will also critically examine the arguments that have tried to draw moral conclusions from metaethics or metaethical conclusions on the basis of what is right and wrong. For example, Richard Hare famously argued that because moral claims express general prescriptions some form of utilitarianism is true.

The second part of the project develops a new way of understanding the connection between normative ethics and metaethics. I will argue that normative ethicists will need to explain why their favourite ethical theories are knowably true. In such explanations, they will have to rely on metaethical views about moral language, thought and properties. This means that normative ethicists must do metaethics and metaethicists normative ethics. I will also argue that the best views in metaethics will constrain which ethical theories are defensible. If this is right, then these areas of moral philosophy are deeply intertwined and therefore making advances in these fields will require much more co-operation between metaethics and normative ethics.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research of this project proposes that, when we evaluate ethical theories concerning which actions are right and wrong, we must take into account metaethical insights about the meaning of ethical terms and the nature of ethical judgments and moral properties (such as rightness and wrongness). This means that some of the ethical theories relied upon in current moral debates can turn out to be untenable because they are not compatible with plausible metaethical frameworks informed by the recent advances in philosophy of language, epistemology, philosophy of mind and metaphysics. The nature of this project therefore lends itself to interdisciplinary and collaborative work as implications of the research will have to be assessed with respect to not only theories in metaethics, normative ethics and applied ethics, but also with respect to theories in philosophy of language, philosophy of mind, epistemology, metaphysics, public policy and law. Some indication of how the research outcomes may impact on these fields has been provided in the academic beneficiaries section. Here I would like to focus on the impact that the research might have outside academic circles and in particular on the work of lawyers, politicians and health care professionals, and finally the general public. 

Lawyers, politicians and healthcare professionals have to make important decisions by comparing the strength of the claims which the groups that are affected by their policies and choices can make. In climate change debates, one has to decide how strong the claims of the future generations are compared to the claims of currently living people. In health care contexts, one has to compare the claims which few individuals have for some expensive treatment against the claims which a large number of people have for some cheap preventive measure. Such important decisions are often made with explicit references to consequentualist ethical theorizing. The idea is to decide in a way that maximizes the amount of general quality-adjusted life years. 

One of the main conclusions of the planned research will be that this type of maximizing consequentialism is not compatible with the defensible metaethical views about the nature of rightness and wrongness. According to the defended view, what is right is essentially constrained by what kind of personal objections individuals are warranted to make to their treatment on the basis of how that treatment affects their life. In this case, smaller claims of a large number of people do not outweigh the claims of a smaller number of people who would bear a more serious burden. In this way, the results of the project can have an impact on what kind of important ethical choices lawyers, politicians and healthcare professionals make. It can protect individuals from being burdened by the general promotion of overall well-being. The metaethical elements of the project also have a direct bearing on general sceptical worries about ethical truth and meaningfulness of ethical debates which many people have. 

Dissemination outside academia and public engagement will take a number of different and complementary forms during and after the Fellowship. The most powerful method for public communication will be through videos hosted at the project's website. I will create a series of short interviews with some of the leading moral philosophers who take part in the project for this purpose. Other activities of the project will also be recorded and hosted online. The project's blog will also create opportunities for public discussions of this work. Philosophers who work in applied ethics and who are well connected to the professional groups listed above will be informed about the video materials through the project's Twitter feed. I will also give public lectures on the project's research for the general audience, for example, at the Royal Institute of Philosophy, Birmingham branch events and at the annual Faith &amp;amp; Reason week.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>108522</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Brown University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Philosophy</gtr:department><gtr:description>Research Visit to Brown University</gtr:description><gtr:id>4536810D-C30D-43D4-AC97-6913C59DDAAE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>&amp;quot;Non-Realist Cognitivism, Truth and Objectivity&amp;quot;, forthcoming in Acta Analytica (see publications).

One key finding of this research project was the idea that this way of distributing resources in public policy is seriously problematic. It is not a just way of making ethical decisions because some of the decisions made in this way could be reasonably rejected by those individuals who are seriously burdened by them. The outcome of this is that in ethical decision making we should pay much closer attention to what kind of personal standpoints different policies create to individual persons and how the burdensomeness of those standpoints compares person to person. 

A part of the project was to disseminate these findings to the those working on Policy and public services, including health care professionals. This was done through social media, a series of blog posts hosted at the Institute of Advanced Studies at the University of Birmingham (under the title Saving Humans by Numbers), public lectures, and via inviting professionals and policy makers to the Methods of Ethics workshops. Reportedly these avenues to impact have already made a difference to how the participants are thinking of their ethical choices in the professional lives. These impacts have so far been mainly regional, however. One of the challenges to achieve impact in the future is how to make a difference in the level of official, nationwide level of policy.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>3561886B-B475-4506-9F91-DA9089A2C0D3</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>58c66fe5726c43.74806965</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>There are three Key Findings associated with the award. The aim of the project was to consider how normative ethics (a field of moral philosophy which studies questions about which actions are right and wrong, what is good and bad, etc.) and metaethics (a field of moral philosophy which studies questions about the meaning of moral language, the nature of moral judgments, and the constitution of moral properties) are related. 

One key finding was to create a map of how the relationship between these two fields have been understood by different philosophers so far: how during the last 50 years or so ethicists have tried to argue that these fields are connected or they are independent of one another. Before this project, there was no systematic inquiry on this and the map of the logical space of arguments will be hugely helpful for future researchers. 

Secondly, during the project, the PI developed a new theory of how the connection between these two fields of moral philosophy should be understood. This theory begins from the idea that any normative ethicists must be able to provide an explanation of moral predicates apply to the set of actions their ethical theory claims they do. Such explanations are in effect explanations of why moral properties are necessarily co-instantiated with the properties described in the ethical theories defended in normative ethics. These explanations then turn out to be views in metaethics and it can be argued that the best metaethical explanation of the co-instantiation in question is based on a certain kind of anti-realism constructed in the basis of an epistemic theory of truth. The second part of the new theory of how the two fields are related is based on the idea that the metaethical view defended first will have normative consequences. It turns out that it best supports a contractualist theory in normative ethics according to which rightness and wrongness of actions is related to which moral codes could not be reasonably rejected by individuals on the basis of the personal burdens they cause to them. 

Finally, one additional key finding is that there is a large number of exiting new work done on the methods of moral philosophy - on how this discipline should be done. This came clearly through in all the presentations of the two international conferences organised as the part of the project. The new methods will rely on more interdisciplinary and empirical way of investigating metaethical and normative questions. They will also make a more careful use of the argumentative tools used in other areas of philosophy, including metaphysics, philosophy language, political philosophy, and feminist philosophy.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings of this project will be taken forward and put to use by others in two main ways. Firstly, the Key Findings will be disseminated for other philosophers and academic researchers through the research outputs and publications. These consist of 5 journal articles, a book manuscript which is currently being revised on the basis of the publisher's readers' comments, and an edited collection of articles which will be published on the basis of the articles presented at the two conferences. The new accounts of how normative ethics and metaethics are connected will have an influence in the field on how these two fields of moral philosophy will be done. 

The key findings of the project will also have an influence on the ethical decision making processes in many policy contexts. These findings have been and will be disseminated through the use of social media and public lectures.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>076E076C-889B-4B0B-ABB4-B544958A49BC</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58b568112ff8b9.68622506</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Environment,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0980958D-1261-40F4-B1EA-7B773EC49569</gtr:id><gtr:title>Non-Realist Cognitivism, Truth and Objectivity</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Acta Analytica</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ae508d8cb7256c9959a6d4599fd9096f"><gtr:id>ae508d8cb7256c9959a6d4599fd9096f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Suikkanen J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58b43a6bc62f82.11873860</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3E1F29FB-D536-4D89-BC7C-464CFA7BA7A7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Contractualism and the Counter-Culture Challenge</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Oxford Studies in Normative Ethics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/cfbca80c5b3c100c5b5bc367d8863689"><gtr:id>cfbca80c5b3c100c5b5bc367d8863689</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Suikkanen JV</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58b43e402c23f6.32070232</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>072679B0-707B-40A8-AB2E-09DC6EB9A2A0</gtr:id><gtr:title>Contractualism as Restricted Constructivism</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Topoi</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ae508d8cb7256c9959a6d4599fd9096f"><gtr:id>ae508d8cb7256c9959a6d4599fd9096f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Suikkanen J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58b43a30a31464.39140910</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A58E364D-C6A2-460B-9550-F8E7FFC00C09</gtr:id><gtr:title>Non-Naturalism and Reference</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Ethics and Social philosophy</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/cfbca80c5b3c100c5b5bc367d8863689"><gtr:id>cfbca80c5b3c100c5b5bc367d8863689</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Suikkanen JV</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58b43d090936b8.61302297</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>70858E6F-2053-4EDD-AF73-60601F8D7C5D</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Blackwell Companion to Naturalism - Clark/The Blackwell Companion to Naturalism</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ae508d8cb7256c9959a6d4599fd9096f"><gtr:id>ae508d8cb7256c9959a6d4599fd9096f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Suikkanen J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58b43c4c1b3d94.88528760</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/M010198/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>946C0541-464B-43A5-9EE3-65C23360E959</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Philosophy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>C3FAF999-8402-446C-8A80-016962744E22</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Epistemology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E24DFBD1-65CA-4C0A-ABA6-58F8F129200B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ethics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6E6227B6-029E-4DD5-8ADF-6D46BE6CEE4D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Language &amp; Philosophical Logic</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8D3297D2-A1F7-4EE8-A676-CD04BB9D7689</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Metaphysics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>143EF6F8-CF59-4D04-9EA7-40D70FC41177</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Philosophy Of Mind</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
