For even though Earth observation satellites have collected data continually at global scale since 1972, the promise of Earth observation has not been realized, since science has not found a way to convert the data contained in large numbers of satellite images into global information that can be analysed by scientists.

One reason for this problem is that global environmental phenomena comprise multiple attributes, e.g. area, carbon density and species richness etc., each studied by a different scientific discipline. The disciplines rarely collaborate and lack technologies to combine their digital information sets operationally even if they wanted to cooperate. Astronomy faced a similar challenge in the 1990s when combining data collected at different wavelengths, e.g. in optical and radio bands, was difficult if not impossible. To tackle the problem it developed the concept of a Virtual Observatory (VO) - a technology layer that sits between the user and astronomy data archives and provides homogeneous access regardless of data type or storage, thus enabling comprehensive and highly focused research that was previously impossible. The UK has played a leading role in developing the VO through AstroGrid technology funded by STFC. 

In recent years there have been calls to establish a family of global environmental observatories to continuously monitor forest change, biodiversity loss and desertification. This project will evaluate the feasibility of using or adapting Astrogrid and later VO technology, developed by a consortium led by the University of Edinburgh, for use in global environmental observatories. Since much of the design of VO technology is generic there is a high probability that it can be used for this purpose. The project will focus on mechanisms needed for a pan-tropical forest observatory, and bring together the Astrogrid community with a 49 member network of UK tropical forest researchers (TROPGLOBE), coordinated by the University of Leeds, who need the information that such an observatory will provide.

This project will begin with a detailed six months study, scoped by an opening conference. The evaluation report will be discussed at a workshop and in the second year of the project there will be trials of pieces of software deemed suitable. The project will also allow scientists from different disciplines to collaborate in overlaying their own sets of information on particular forest attributes with regional forest area maps, and astronomers and global change scientists in the same university to establish joint groups to engage in dialogue and joint trials of software.

This unique collaboration between the UK astronomical and global change communities will address the CLASP challenge areas of automated ecosystem monitoring and monitoring emission sources and sinks, and the CLASP technology gaps of Earth observation and networks of sensors and data systems. It will lead to a quantum leap in Earth observation technology that will enable scientists to greatly improve their estimates of the global extent and rate of change of terrestrial phenomena and thereby provide a more robust basis for policy making.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will have a major impact in the challenge area of automated ecosystem monitoring, by demonstrating how global environmental observatories, using Virtual Observatory technology, could convert the automated collection of data by satellite sensors, and automated and manual measurement of ground data, into a continuous flow of information that can be used for scientific analysis, and the production of global environmental knowledge that can inform policy-making. This will enable the UK to play a leading role in establishing global environmental observatories, just as the University of Manchester and University of Cambridge led the way in pioneering radio astronomy after World War II. The prototype pan-tropical forest observatory whose functions are simulated here will, if made operational, tackle the other challenge area of monitoring carbon emission sources and sinks. 

To maximize impact the project will link major beneficiaries, the TROPGLOBE network of UK tropical forest researchers, who need better global information on tropical forests and can contribute their own data to ensure this, directly to members of the UK astronomical community, whose Virtual Observatory technology can facilitate this. Besides having substantial experience in very large area monitoring, astronomers developed this technology to tackle similar constraints to those currently limiting global change research, including lack of cooperation between scientists from different disciplines and insufficient integration of data collected by different sensors.

The TROPGLOBE network, coordinated by the University of Leeds, includes:

1. Twenty three universities and research institutes: Aberystwyth University; Bangor University; Bournemouth University; Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Edinburgh; Cranfield University; University of Aberdeen; Imperial College, London; James Hutton Institute, Aberdeen; Kings College, London; Royal Botanic Gardens, Edinburgh; Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew; University College, London; University of Bristol; University of Cambridge; University of Edinburgh; University of Exeter; University of Lancaster; University of Leeds; University of Leicester; University of Oxford; University of Sheffield; and University of York.

2. Four companies: Delta T Devices; DMCI International; Ecometrica; and Skye Instruments.

3. Three research council facilities: NERC National Centre for Earth Observation; STFC Daresbury, Computational Science and Engineering; and STFC UK Astronomy Technology Centre.

4. Two other stakeholders: the Forestry Commission and Global Canopy Programme.

Indirect beneficiaries include the international scientific networks in which members of the TROPGLOBE network participate, e.g., AfriTRON; British Ecological Society Tropical Ecology Group; Centre for Tropical Forest Science; East Asia and Pacific Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network; GEM: Group on Earth Observations Forest Carbon Tracking Project; International LTER Network; IUCN Species Survival Commission; NERC SAFE project: RAINFOR; TRY (Global Plant Traits Network); UK Global Forest Monitoring Consortium; and the World Forest Observatory network. AstroGrid was a founder member of the International Virtual Observatory Alliance. The budget allows 1-2 overseas scientists to attend each meeting. Also benefiting will be policy makers in the UK Government, and in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and UN Convention on Biological Diversity, who need better knowledge on the state of the global environment. Policymakers will be invited to the closing conference in London.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-02-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>139980</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Within the timeframe of the project itself, the impact was purely academic, although this was broadly environmental rather than just research.

The aim was to test the idea that &amp;quot;Virtual Observatory&amp;quot; software developed under previous STFC funding could be adapted to use in forest monitoring research and related environmental areas, to help make widespread datasets into a seamless whole, and easier to undertake environmental research. We concluded that although it was not cost effective to directly adapt the astronomical software itself, we could use the technical concepts and the methods for international co-operation and standards development, which had led to the astronomical software. Astronomy and forest monitoring scientific and technical staff collaborated to produce a working demonstration of a &amp;quot;yellow pages&amp;quot; style data system, an outline of a new forest monitoring metadata scheme, and a plan for standards development based on Open GIS standards.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The whole aim of the project is to re-purpose astronomical software and concepts in environmental disciplines.
