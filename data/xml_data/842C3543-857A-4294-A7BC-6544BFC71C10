Although this work was not on medical research but on understanding how the healthy gut works our research could ultimately inform us of what goes wrong in inflammatory bowel disease; This disease has significant treatment costs with up to ?762 spent per patient per year. With an estimated 182,700 people in the UK having a form of IBD the total annual cost to the NHS is estimated to be ?131 million. Furthermore the incidence of IBD is rising with time. Several treatments for IBD have shown some success but new treatments are lacking, which stems from a lack of understanding of the basic mechanisms involved in gut homeostasis versus disease. Our research aims to understand these fundamental cellular processes in health that can eventually inform the scientific field about disease and ultimately treatments. 
Speculatively, in the longer term (&amp;gt;10 years) pharmaceutical companies potentially may be in a position to use our research models; potentially moving from mouse studies to the human we in the longer term be able to develop more targeted treatments for patients with less side effects leading to improved health and longevity of patients and so impact positively on the downstream costs of health care.
Public Engagement / Outreach Activities in particular involving school children, high school teachers, undergraduate students and the general public informing them of the impact of our research. The IFR holds Open Days every few years, the last one in 2012. During these events we also convey the gut research we are conducting in the laboratory and also impress upon them the importance of experimental animals models in our work. This project would also allow us to demonstrate the translational pipeline from mouse to human and help increase public understanding of basic research towards the clinic. Presented research at Caf? Scientifique; a forum to present scientific research to the public. The research from this project will also be presented at this forum, which will be sure to evokes a lively debate. Our Gut Health and Food Safety Department has a webpage, which is updated regularly with blogs and tweets concerning ongoing research with in the program in our research group (http://www.ifr.ac.uk/ghfs/)
We routinely host undergraduate students for their undergraduate projects in the laboratory (in addition to presenting undergraduate lectures). We also retain these students for future PhD projects or technician posts in our laboratory after their graduation. 
We routinely host high school students providing them with work experience in the laboratory. This also includes public engagement with regards to understanding the role of animals in research including visits to the animal facility, which we regard to be an important aspect of research to disseminate to the public. We have also hosted high School Teachers and presented research at the IFR Teacher event which entails informing teachers of the nature of the research conducted at IFR and also what careers are open to their children if they choose to pursue a career in science. 

Research Staff Training-the post-doctoral researcher benefit from improved experimental, modelling and transferable skills that will aid the future earning power of the national workforce.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>94F78BE1-7A85-4A04-AA96-E4FE0A83C598</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545cd86f4e3024.63053932</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The intestinal epithelium forms a barrier between commensal bacteria and the underlying immune cells that are located in the lamina propria. Exclusion of bacteria by the epithelium from the lamina propria prevents an inflammatory response and helps maintains gut health. The colonic epithelium constantly renews itself through proliferation of epithelial stem cells located at the base of epithelial invaginations called crypts. Work from our laboratory, and others, have shown that shown that immune cells are recruited to the epithelial stem cell niche following luminal-sensing of commensal bacteria during homeostasis (paper accepted Journal of Immunology, in press) and injury (Pull et al. 2007 PNAS). However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which the epithelial stem cell niche either modulates, and/or is modulated by, immune cells to maintain epithelial health are largely unknown. Recently, we demonstrated a novel concept for the maintenance of a healthy colon in the mouse. We show that luminal bacteria, gut epithelial stem cells and immune cells called monocytes, work in concert to maintain gut health / homeostasis. We also have described a intriguing phenomenon whereby crypt epithelial stem cells can extend cellular processes to make contact with monocytes and that monocytes make contact in a reciprocal fashion. Our preliminary data suggests that a similar paradigm exists in the human. Taken together our findings suggest that the interaction between crypt stem cells and the monocyte play a key role in maintaining gut health. It is of paramount importance to understand the basic mechanisms by which the human gut maintains health because the lack of a protective immune response is thought to cause chronic gut inflammation leading to inflammatory bowel disease.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Speculatively, in the longer term (&amp;gt;10 years) pharmaceutical companies potentially may be in a position to use our research models; potentially moving from mouse studies to the human we in the longer term be able to develop more targeted treatments for patients with less side effects leading to improved health and longevity of patients and so impact positively on the downstream costs of health care.
Other academics will also benefit from this step change in understanding of the innate immune system in maintaining a healthy gut.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8C64C6E8-DDF3-4F43-B57D-DB207F4B93E9</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545cd7a0804f39.37864750</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A106A1DE-82C9-40C8-8028-8E4D80E10EC5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Luminal microbes promote monocyte-stem cell interactions across a healthy colonic epithelium.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/770b983c81d9ca22c039b6194bfe2280"><gtr:id>770b983c81d9ca22c039b6194bfe2280</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Skoczek DA</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0022-1767</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>541c12b05a8615.14011977</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BBS/E/F/00042234</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
