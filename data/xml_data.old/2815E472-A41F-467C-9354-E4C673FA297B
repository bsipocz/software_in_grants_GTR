To this end, the project outputs will be:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>a mass-market paperback anthology aimed at the general public weaving together a number of ordinary people?s diary-type stories (drawn from the data collected by FCMAP from the Mass Observation Archive and volunteer reader groups of the University of the Third Age)&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>a public day event in Central London in June 2013 designed to attract user groups, stakeholders, policy makers, academics and the general public by including a presentation on the subject of the anthology from the project team, readings from some of subjects, plenary panels and an early-evening public forum featuring a leading cultural figure (or figures) in discussion of the cultural significance of the new narratives of ageing.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project is concerned with the primary aim of disseminating a new narrative-based understanding of the life course, derived from the original FCMAP research project, as directly as possible to a section of the general public without the journalistic distortion of the media. The means of doing this is by producing a popular anthology of narrative accounts of ageing, provisionally entitled Our Age: Everyday Diaries of Ageing in Contemporary Britain, with the potential to become a bestseller, modelled on the very successful anthologies of wartime and post-war experiences compiled from the Mass Observation Archive; and to supplement this strategy with a headline public event in Central London. Therefore, the beneficiaries of this project will be, in the first instance, the readership of this anthology, which because of the subject of the book can be expected to be weighted towards older members of society. It is hoped that through this exposure to the public, that the idea of self-reflective narrative understanding being a key component of active ageing will spread through society as a meme, enhancing cultural enrichment, quality of life, health and well-being and facilitating the attendant benefits of social welfare and cohesion.

The production of this anthology will benefit the public by presenting through the everyday diaries of ordinary people the key story of ageing in contemporary Britain over the last three decades: how the behaviour and the economic and social importance of people in their sixties and, in many cases, their seventies completely invalidates the general media representation of the 'elderly' and, in particular, the persistent labelling by government and media of ageing as a social problem. Furthermore, and crucially, it will enable readers to see for themselves the advantage that drawing on a narrative understanding of one's own life confers on people as they grow older. The anthology will show how viewing the process of ageing - including such aspects as children leaving home, menopause, careers coming to an end, retirement, post-retirement activities (including the U3A, voluntary work, caring for grandchildren), care homes, bereavement and infirmity - through the lens of self-reflective narrative allows one to see it as a journey of continued self-discovery rather than a pre-ordained pathway to 'dependence, decrepitude and death' (Laslett 1989, 4).

To link this exemplary process of public engagement with the pre-existing knowledge exchange pathways established by the original FCMAP project - ongoing policy impact generated by the co-writing of the book-length report, Coming of Age, with Demos and a lasting academic legacy in the form of publications including Hubble and Tew's Ageing, Narrative and Identity: New Qualitative Social Research - a day event will be held in Central London bringing together the research team and some of the contributors to the anthology with members of the public, policy makers, representatives of the media and other academics. Here, the significance of this emergence in the real world of a new narrative-based understanding of the life course will be discussed and, it is expected, that fruitful directions for future research will emerge. A 16-page programme for the day will include a synopsis of the FCMAP research and the preparatory research for the anthology, descriptions of previous events such as the New Cultures of Ageing conference, suggested further reading , links (e.g. to the online edition of Coming of Age) and contact details. The day will end with an early-evening public forum featuring a leading cultural figure or figures in discussion of the cultural significance of the new narratives of ageing (equivalent to the high-profile public discussions organised as part of the original FCMAP project, between David Lodge and Jim Crace in February 2010 and between Will Self and Fay Weldon in April 2011)</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>97371</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Narratives of Ageing in Contemporary Britain</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FD4C177E-258E-4C54-9DBE-7F17A4FF3C16</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A day of workshops and talks on the FCMAP project and introducing the (follow-on) FCMAAP project; as well as other talks of ageing by speakers such as Anne Karpf.

12 February 2013 Tew and Hubble drew on project finding to give evidence in a presenta-tion, 'Good Ageing: The Importance of Social and Cultural Narratives; And of Older Peo-ple's Continuing Control over Their Personal Narratives' to 'Ageing and Wellbeing: Flourish-ing in Later Life', A workshop organised by the Birmingham Policy Commission on 'Healthy Ageing in the 21st Century', Mary Sumner House, London, 12 February.

The resulting publication of 'Healthy Ageing in the 21st Century: The Best is Yet to Come', featuring evidence from Tew and Hubble pp.10,16, was launched on 3 February 2014 at the House of Commons, Westminster Palace, where we discussed our evidence at length with interested parties. The report is available in print and as a downloadable PDF: 
http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/Documents/research/policycommission/healthy-ageing/Healthy-Ageing-Policy-Commission-Report.pdf

16 April 2013 Hubble and Taylor attended 'Mass Observing Today: Opportunities for New Research' at the Charity Centre, Directory of Social Change - an event with an audience of about 80 academics, third sector employees and social entrepreneurs. Hubble gave a presenta-tion referring to FCMAP and FCMAAP 'Why I Collaborated with the Mass Observation Project' and also appeared as a closing plenary panelist at 'Mass Observing Today: Opportuni-ties for New Research', Charity Centre, Directory of Social Change, London, 16 April.

12 June 2013 'Narratives of Ageing in Contemporary Britain' one-day public symposium at Senate House, University of London: featuring presentations by Tew, Hubble and Taylor; and also by fellow Brunel researcher in ageing, Jago Morrison. Other speakers included Kirsty Pattrick and Jessica Scantlebury (both Mass Observation Archive), 'The Mass Observation Project', Zoe Brennan (University of the West of England), Anne Karpf (writer and journal-ist), Jonathan Hughes (Centre for Inclusion and Collaborative Partnerships at the Open Uni-versity) and Alan Walker, Professor of Social Policy and Social Gerontology at the University of Sheffield, Director of the New Dynamics of Ageing Programme, author of numerous books and studies on ageing and social policy. Over 100 people attended across the day.

Outcomes from 12 June event: evidence was supplied to Chris Manthorp for his book A Rough Guide to Ageing (forthcoming) and Anne Karpf for her book How to Age (2014). Karpf was requested to speak to U3A branches. Jago Morrison is drawing on material presented for his Ageing in Contemporary Fiction Routledge (forthcoming 2016). Furthermore, during the project, Prof Tew drew upon work in progress for this current project to produce chapters for the following books: Alan Walker (ed.), The New Science of Ageing (Policy Press, 2014) and Alan Walker (ed.), The New Dynamics of Ageing Volume 2 (Policy Press, forthcoming 2015).

During the period of the project, the PI and CI kept in touch with the main coordinators of the U3A and updated them and participants in the project by circulating findings. There was also a feedback session at Brunel to selected members of the Brunel Institute for Ageing Studies.




21 October 2013 (Tew and Hubble) 'Presentation' to the New Dynamics of Ageing Closing Conference, London Design Centre, 21 October - included discussion of FCMAAP and presentation of findings. Some of the examples from this evidence were included in NDA Findings 28 (see p.7), which is available in print and as a downloadable PDF:
http://www.newdynamics.group.shef.ac.uk/assets/files/NDA%20Findings_28.pdf

30 October 2013 An audience of over 50 attended 'Contemporary Narrative and the Coming of Ageing', an evening event hosted by the BCCW at the Institute of English Studies, Senate House, University of London. The event began with a debate on ageing in contemporary Britain and the fictional representation of older subjects conducted by Paul Bailey (At the Jerusalem; Chapman's Odyssey) and Courttia Newland (The Scholar; Society Within; Snakeskin). The second part of the evening was a book launch, with wine reception, for a new academic study by Brunel scholars Dr. Nick Hubble and Prof, Philip Tew drawing on the data produced by the original Fiction and Cultural Mediation of Ageing Project (FCMAP) also funded by the ESRC. Ageing, Narrative and Identity: New Qualitative Social Research (2013) outlines the methodology and results of FCMAP and in investigating how older people resist stereotypical cultural representations of ageing, the study demonstrates the importance of narrative understanding to social agency. Additionally, this volume outlines related aspects of social policy, social narrative and wider socio-cultural conceptions of the interaction between representation and everyday life. This launch also served to announce publicly new major research findings from the ESRC funded, NDA affiliated, Fiction and Cultural Mediation of Ageing Project (FCMAP). 

Also Prof Tew was interviewed by the think tank Canvas8 in October 2013 resulting in a major interview/feature article on the findings from the projects: http://www.canvas8.com/public/2013/10/03/coming-of-age-senior-citizens.html

Forthcoming: Ageing event at literary festival October 2015 - reading, discussion, exhibition

Despite all the activities above where public engagement was involved further impact so far has been limited because we as yet have not agreed a contract for the forthcoming anthology, In Our Age: Eight Postwar Lives, with a publisher - the proposal having been turned down by Profile and Picador. The researchers then revised the proposal at length as a result of verbal feedback from the publishers and resubmitted to Bloomsbury earlier in 2014. We are still awaiting a decision. The team is certain that following publication which we anticipate eagerly there will be a press release further dissemination events</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>C2A01E4B-641D-4067-B06A-363DFA7B2D2D</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545771e0485900.12755739</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C1F33247-763E-452C-B57E-91B0436BBD87</gtr:id><gtr:title>Special Section Introduction: Mass Observation as Method</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Sociological Research Online</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b8c7f6f756c19503df9e50783f610e7a"><gtr:id>b8c7f6f756c19503df9e50783f610e7a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Casey E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58ca93942977c9.04063384</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>84374BC4-B323-4F65-872F-9529635EB8F8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Ageing, Narrative and Identity: New Qualitative Social Research</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/50bba5f759c00b1d421886045d0cdce2"><gtr:id>50bba5f759c00b1d421886045d0cdce2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hubble Nick</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780230390935</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>56dddb077007f8.25285430</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/J021008/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>020361E1-B8CA-49FD-9149-27D31D21C7A3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DCE73056-5E3D-4976-B573-234E5FF4D633</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic &amp; Social History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1AD4F77F-8ADE-4FAE-8B36-11029C350EDE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Lifewriting</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>020361E1-B8CA-49FD-9149-27D31D21C7A3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
