Work will proceed by means of telephone interviews with researchers leading to an initial working paper. User responses will be gathered through two seminars and the project website; and selected researchers will atttend a symposium intended to distil insights and implications for users and to present them in an accessible form. A widely-circulated hardcopy summary of the outcomes together with online video resources will be made available to users, who will be invited to attend one of a series of dissemination seminars to be held at various locations around the UK. &lt;br />&lt;br />The research project will examine the development of the concept of martyrdom and sacrificial death in Britain and Ireland since the outbreak of the First World War. It will proceed through archival, library and web-based research on historic sources, including books and pamphlets, newspapers and online databases, supplemented as necessary by site visits. There will also be a series of semi-structured interviews with political and religious activists, carried out in partnership with the Belfast-based Institute for Conflict Research, in four contrasting locations in Britain and Ireland, Belfast, Bradford, Dublin and London. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Non-academic beneficiaries of both the leadership activities and the research project will fall into three main categories: 
1. Religious organizations and their leaders. Initial soundings suggest that there will be strong interest in the project from senior figures in organizations such as the Church of England, the Presbyterian Church of Ireland, and the East London Mosque. A particular link has been established with the Christian-Muslim Forum (to be represented on the Advisory Group by Dr Philip Lewis) and we would anticipate further interest from groups operating in inter-faith relations. Previous work by the PI and by ICR has established strong networks with religious practitioners especially in London and in Northern Ireland, and we would expect further to build on these as work proceeds. 
2. Policy-makers and practitioners in central and local government and in NGOs and community groups, concerned with issues of security and community cohesion. The project will build upon the networks with this category of users being developed in the seminars to be held during 2012 under the PI's current Global Uncertainties project 'Protestant-Catholic Conflict: Historical Perspectives and Contemporary Realities'. 
3. The media, and through them a wider public interested in or concerned about religion and its diverse effects on the security and stability of society, and/or the sensitive and well-informed commemoration of the centenaries of 2014 and 2016. These anniversaries may also give rise to interest from practitioners in the arts. 
In relation to all these categories the expectation is that a circle of existing contacts, arising both from the PI's prior GU work and his AHRC Knowledge Transfer Fellowship on London's religious history, will be multiplied during the course of the programme through drawing on the enthusiasm and networks of the individuals initially involved. 

Respective anticipated benefits will be as follows: 
1. Religious leaders and organizations will be enabled to view their activities in constructively critical perspective, seeing themselves as others see them in well-digested concise academically-informed analysis. Existing experience in dialogue with this group of users indicates that such contributions will generally be warmly welcomed in strengthening a valuable objective middle ground of discourse between partisan advocacy of religion and polemical secular or atheist attacks. It is therefore realistic to look for consequent medium-term behavioural change reinforcing the potential of organized religion to be a force for stabilization rather than insecurity. 
2. Policy makers and practitioners - for whom the religious dimension is one among many - will be provided with an accessible digest of high quality recent research that will help to inform their thinking and decision-making. Those with a stronger interest will be able to participate in user seminars thus further developing their understanding of the issues and the project team's awareness of further potential impacts. 
3. The quality of journalism and broadcasting on relevant subjects will be enhanced by the availability of a concise integrated summary of Global Uncertainties and related research on religion, thus leading to improved wider public understanding of the issues. Media interest in marking the 2014 and 2016 centenaries will be met by the provision of insight and analysis grounded in detailed research data. 

While some benefits will be immediate, it is recognized that others will be medium to long-term ones, resulting from the continued dissemination and permeation of the outcomes.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-10-15</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>287682</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Lapido Media: Centre for Religious Literacy in Journalism</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Religious Literacy in Journalism</gtr:description><gtr:id>EA3BA70C-0523-406E-8480-86729C53BC79</gtr:id><gtr:impact>January 2015 public engagement event - listed elsewhere.

Our shared key message centred on the need for us all to develop our religious literacy if we are to effectively understand and address the challenges that we face in a time of global uncertainty. With a particular focus on the media and conflict reportage, we were pleased that Caroline Wyatt, formerly BBC Defence and now Religion Correspondent, moderated the event. Our eminent panellists - Dr Mustafa Baig, Professor Grace Davie, Betsy Hiel, Tom Holland and Dr Marat Shterin - scoped our present predicament from within several disciplines. Around 100 delegates attended in person, representing a diverse constituency of policy-makers, academics, journalists and practitioners, and they were given the opportunity to discuss and recommend actions that may help inform awareness of religious issues in relation to security and global affairs. Video of the event and copies of the presentations were subsequently made available on the website and it was quite extensively reported in the media (for links see url below). 

The event was supported by the RCUK Partnership for Security, Crime and Research and sponsored by John Glen, MP (Conservative) and Dai Havard, MP (Labour) on behalf of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Global Uncertainties.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d961761471b7.03033919</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.open.ac.uk/arts/research/religion-martyrdom-global-uncertainties/events</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Religion, Security and Global Uncertainties (Milton Keynes)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BA4C56E1-F7BD-4C55-BF23-30E0BF2576C3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This event offered an opportunity to discuss the implications of our recently published 'Religion, Security, and Global Uncertainties' report, and complemented our other event on 6th January in London - which targeted the media, policy makers and practitioners - by providing an opportunity for more specifically academic reflection on the project and the potential for future related research.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d963371dce62.71653887</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Third sector organisations</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.open.ac.uk/arts/research/religion-martyrdom-global-uncertainties/events</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Religion, Conflict and Security Workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>42B5CA5F-EE7A-445D-9882-A39789CE1F13</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Around 20 people representing a cross-section of political, professional, education, religious and media interests took part in a two day workshop which I hosted to identify key implications of the research.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b9ab040948a5.00424824</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Religion and Security: Media perspectives</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A036BBBB-86BF-4AC7-A56E-E382DEDF1469</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Meeting with 3 senior Northern Ireland journalists, who engaged constructively with the project, and advised us on strategies for media engagement.

Professor John Wolffe began the proceedings with a presentation outlining our report, with reflections on the importance of considering 'cultural' or 'soft' security, and thus, the need for more work to be done to make people feel secure about their own identity and culture through nurturing a shared sense of belonging. In subsequent wide-ranging and lively discussion the importance of enhancing religious literacy was particularly emphasized and mutual understanding between the various constituencies represented was enhanced.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d95ee454af94.87220427</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.open.ac.uk/arts/research/religion-martyrdom-global-uncertainties/events</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Remembering 1916: Martyrdom and Sacrifice (Belfast)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DF877A4A-A0BA-4F57-9110-9FD0CAE3BC21</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This talk, at Union Theological College in Belfast, was given at the invitation of the Council for Church and Society of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, and drew a substantial audience (50-60) from all over Northern Ireland, as well as a few from the Republic of Ireland. It formed part of their endeavours to facilitate constructive reflection and response to the centenaries of the Easter Rising and the Battle of the Somme, both of which fall in 2016. Prof Wolffe's presentation stimulated extensive discussion and questioning, which the organizers considered a very helpful contribution to their wider endeavours to build cross-community understanding in Northern Ireland.

Return invitations to Belfast and to Lancashire are indicative that a worthwhile contribution was made, and that and ongoing conversation is valued.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>314D3A3A-CCB4-4475-AF00-F8F644495F15</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d99db37f8a13.02377160</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>In line with the specifications of the original call the achievements of this grant relate both to leadership and synthesis and to original research. 
Key leadership achievements were: 
? The production of a report, Religion, Security and Global Uncertainties, drawing on an extensive programme of interviews with academics and roundtables with stakeholders, providing an accessible overview of current research in the field. It is available both in hardcopy (with approximately 400 copies already distributed) and online at http://www.open.ac.uk/arts/research/religion-martyrdom-global-uncertainties/reports, together with associated videos that provide a 6 minute introduction to the themes of the written report. 
? The holding of a series of meetings with diverse groups of non-academic stakeholders in Belfast, Blackburn, Exeter, Edinburgh, London and Milton Keynes to publicise the report and discuss its implications. The London meeting in January 2015 was a high-profile event in Parliament sponsored by John Glen, MP (Conservative) and Dai Havard, MP (Labour) chaired by Caroline Wyatt (BBC Religious Affairs correspondent) and attracted an attendance of around 100 people. Total attendances at the 5 events was around 200. The Blackburn event was noteworthy for active constructive engagement from members of the local Muslim community, especially the co-organiser Anjum Anwar, which has led to several follow-up invitations. In general these activities have resulted in the development of extensive informal contacts and networks - both academic and non-academic - which provide a strong basis for ongoing effective public engagement. 
Key research achievements were: 
? Conducting a series of 45 semi-structured interviews with community activists in Belfast, Bradford, Dublin and London exploring contemporary attitudes to perceived martyrdom and sacrificial death, in the context particularly of ongoing terrorist incidents and the upcoming centenaries of the First World War and the Easter Rising. Respondents were drawn from a cross-section of Muslim, Protestant and Roman Catholic backgrounds In addition to providing data for the PI's ongoing writing and publication activity, this material will be deposited in the UK Data Archive where it will be a valuable resource for other researcher in the field. 
? Archival research and fieldwork (in various locations in Belgium, England, France, Ireland and Scotland) on the commemoration of the dead of the First World War, which, in particular, has shed new light on the tensions between religious and secular influences and on attitudes to religions other than Christianity. Further research on attitudes to both religious and secular/nationalistic martyrdom during the course of the twentieth century (for example in the controversy over the Falklands Service in 1982) is linking this work to insights derived from the contemporary interviews.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings of the leadership strand are of considerable significance for the development of policy by central and local government and by NGOs, especially in highlighting the importance of ensuring that responses to ongoing security challenges, from Da'esh and others, are informed by a sophisticated understanding of religion. 
These finding are gaining new audiences through contacts from the project. For example
? In his role as external champion for the Partnership for Conflict, Crime and Security Research Dr Tristram-Riley Smith is giving invaluable assistance in promoting awareness of them to policy-makers and others. 
? The PI expects to participate in the new Centre for Research and Evidence on Security Threats at Lancaster University, which will be an important channel for taking forward the outcomes in both academic and non-academic contexts.
? As a direct result of the project the PI was invited to become a Trustee of Lapido Media - Centre for Religious Literacy in Journalism, which has substantial potential as a route for disseminating and advancing project findings in print and broadcast media. 
Opportunities will be taken to promote the research strand in response to the Easter Rising centenary in April 2016 and the ongoing centenary of the First World War. It is intended that this work will both feed into the growing academic interest in memorialisation and memory, and the work of agencies encouraging inclusive and non-confrontational forms of commemoration in the UK and Ireland.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>6DBDDAA7-21F7-4582-AA7B-0EA189B54A0D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5698b44654a781.13546442</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.open.ac.uk/arts/research/religion-martyrdom-global-uncertainties/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>APPG Religious Literacy Report</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>39D4B05B-45B0-42A0-BD98-CCA5C433A0FF</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58b9a78b92cdd2.69954199</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.reonline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/APPG-on-RE-Improving-Religious-Literacy-full-report.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4163642C-5AD7-4773-A937-A0DF7F2E7BA9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Representing Irish Religious Histories</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b35f176c3872e51aa3d96cb61eab67f1"><gtr:id>b35f176c3872e51aa3d96cb61eab67f1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wolffe J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-3-319-41530-7</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>58b9a018be8d22.41367613</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>EEED410D-92A5-4F98-B224-32919BD97DC3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Christianity and National Identity in Twentieth-Century Europe - Conflict, Community, and the Social Order</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b35f176c3872e51aa3d96cb61eab67f1"><gtr:id>b35f176c3872e51aa3d96cb61eab67f1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wolffe J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9783525101490</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>58bc672b6428d5.83290214</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>09C5CF9B-F861-4259-85CD-7F4BA16453D8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Religion, Security and Global Uncertainties</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f0027b7d00e226e502c216ae8d30caf6"><gtr:id>f0027b7d00e226e502c216ae8d30caf6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wolffe, John</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5447c051bb55f0.17204390</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>331D3ED0-1418-4D8E-8E08-44C0DC143649</gtr:id><gtr:title>'Martyrs as really as St Stephen was a martyr'?
