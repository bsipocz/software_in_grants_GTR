However, the screening of antibodies is cumbersome, expensive and requires in vivo rodent models. This is due to the fact that an antibody is made up by two different genes the heavy (VH) and light (VL) chain, the combination of which differs in each individual B-cell. The holy grail of antibody discovery is to identify the combination of VH and VL in individual B cells. A novel game changing approach combines microfluidic B-cell isolation, amplification, barcoding of the VH and VL regions followed and long-read sequencing. Exeter will implement a single-cell isolation platform to isolate the VH-VL pairs from single cells and sequence them in its long-read sequencing facility. Hummingbird Bioscience will be able to use the resulting data to clone the discovered VH-VL pairs to enhance the stability, affinity an efficacy of antibodies used in cancer therapeutics targeting the EGFR family of receptor tyrosine kinases.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Moor Instruments Ltd</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Moor Instruments Ltd - A Shore</gtr:description><gtr:id>52106C37-F251-40EA-8D7F-9A46DFD282A4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The project, in its early stages, has established an extension to the relationship between the University of Exeter Medical School and Moor Instruments and provides a basis for future relationships between academia, industry and appropriate surgical disciplines to investigate technologies that can aid intra-operative decisions over a wider range of clinical/surgical applications.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c274277d3cd9.51811235-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>In kind contributions will be provided by Moor Instruments to cover the lease costs of the Laser Speckle Imaging system with its prototype IoTBFI modifications, its associated computer and the mobile stand of the imager for the duration of the project.

We are in the process of setting up a perfusion apparatus and developing protocols for perfusion of rat mesentery tissue. We have managed to exteriorise the rat mesentery and exposed several generations of blood vessels on the microscope stage. In future experiments, to quantify and compare effects of HA22 immunotoxin throughout the vascular tree, fresh rat mesenteric sheets will be laid out in a warmed medium-bath on the stage of a stereomicroscope, a large mesenteric artery will be cannulated and the network of blood vessels will be perfused at physiological pressure with buffer containing HA22 immunotoxin. 
We are also continuing with a systematic investigation of the effects of the HA22 immunotoxin and its components in an intact vascular tree derived from human mesentery tissue obtained from patients undergoing colorectal surgery, approved and supplied by the Exeter Tissue Bank. Because of constraints on the availability of human tissues, the first group of experiments used excised mesenteric artery sections to determine the time-course and concentration dependence of HA22 interactions. To investigate the effect of HA22 immunotoxin on vascular permeability, excised mesenteric artery sections were incubated with buffer only or buffer containing HA22 in the presence of the vascular permeability marker albumin labelled with the red fluorophore TRITC for 1h at 37&amp;deg;C. Confocal microscopy images show that in the control vessles albumin is present only at the endothelial surface but has penetrated into the intima and media of the HA22-treated vessel, indicating that HA22 affects vascular permeability. Future work will seek to determine the structural basis of this change.
 
A method for the isolation of microvascular endothelial cells from the human mesentery is also being developed for molecular studies of the effect of HA22 immunotoxin on endothelial cells. To determine HA22-induced changes in cytokine levels, we will perform flow cytometry on control and HA22-treated endothelial cells harvested from the mesentery using antibodies against cytokines and adhesion molecules, implicated in mediating the effects of immunotoxins on endothelial cells. TNFa, a well-known endothelial activator, will serve as positive control.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c25cb9c23769.90791614-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>MedImmune is providing funding toward a post-doctoral researcher for a period 12 months to a value of &amp;pound;73,942 and will supply immunotoxins as required in the project.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>To investigate the mechanisms of Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE)-based immunotoxin (IT)-induced vascular leakage and haemolysis that may lead to refinements of administration protocols or the development of support measures to alleviate the side effects of PE-IT treatment.
