That formal, normative science may take the form of a theory of truth-conditions, a theory of inferential practice, a theory of assertion, and so on. Deep problems afflict semantics as a research program. Two central problems are:\n\n(a) The Liar-paradoxes: contradictions seem to arise when language talks about itself. The simplest Liar paradox is a sentence that says of itself that it is not true. There are currently within semantics many competing approaches about how to treat these paradoxes, including the idea that there are true contradictions.\n\n(b) Vagueness: a pervasive feature of natural languages is that predicates, like 'pink', 'heap', 'human', etc, are vague. The problem is that the range of things to which vague predicates apply have fuzzy boundaries, but the nature of this fuzziness is very difficult to analyze. Vague-predicates generate the Sorites paradox that implies that vague language is incoherent. Theorists have argued that predicates are really sharp, despite appearances (epistemicism) or semantically undecided (supervaluationism). \n\nThere is no general consensus about the right solutions to these problems. \n\nI contend that these paradoxes are not going to be solved by semantics, that semantics is the problem rather than the solution. The reason is that semantics is deeply tied to the idea that predicates, like 'true', 'heap', etc, have extensions, that is, a set of things of which they are true. Extensions are central theoretical tools in semantics. The reason they are central to semantics is that the definition of the truth of sentences, including those about truth, is given in terms of extensions. For example, a simple atomic sentence, 'O is F', for some thing O, and F, is true if and only if O is in the extension of F. But the belief that the truth-predicate and vague predicates have extensions generates the paradoxes of truth and vagueness. Proposing that predicates lack extensions seems unintelligible for semantics, since their possessing meaning, requires, within semantics, a theory about how predicates contribute to truth-conditions. \n\nI offer an alternative framework, Global Expressivism (GE), in which we stop analyzing language in terms of semantic theory. GE is a theory about language-activity and underlying cognitive structures. It extrapolates some core ideas of value expressivism, according to which, assertions of value express affective states. It's not that all assertions express affective states, but all express kinds of states that are non-representational. While each assertion has representational content, it is not inherited from the underlying expressed state. Instead of a theory of content, GE provides an expressivist theory of talk of content and talk of truth-conditions for all sentences. GE describes the truth-predicate's function, but truth itself is not defined theoretically, so predicate extensions have no theoretical role. GE entails a form of indeterminacy solution to the liar, which escapes from the many forms of revenge paradox threatening any solution, through the non-semantic compositionality features governing sentences. The solution to the Sorites paradox is also an indeterminacy solution: the paradox arises from principles that say that vague predicates are tolerant of small changes in things they apply to. GE entails that one cannot say how small precise changes in things affect application of predicates.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project lies within the domain of basic research, attempting to refigure fundamental assumptions about language and meaning. It is not possible, within the scope of a foundational monograph, to address a broader public, though I expect to make the book as accessible to the interested reader as possible. I will do that by cutting out as much technical detail as possible, keeping only that which is essential to the main arguments of the book. In the longer term, I expect the work undertaken here to have the potential to affect a range of fields of thought, some of which lie outside the narrow domain of purely academic interest. The academic fields are philosophy, linguistics, cognitive science, and law. The book challenges a paradigm important to all these fields and will have impact upon research in these areas-see impact plan. Outside of academia, debates about culture and society, value and science, the practice of literary or artistic interpretation, are influenced by underlying ideas about language and reality. For example, post-structuralist philosophy of language, chiefly in the form of deconstructivist critique, has a huge influence outside of academia. The kind of questioning undertaken of basic semantic assumptions in my book ought, given the wide publicity lavished on the deconstructivist critique, to gain some public attention-see impact plan.\n\nIn the course of the fellowship, I do not plan to any non-technical dissemination of the ideas evolving in the non-semantic framework I am developing. Nor will I be looking to more detailed application of ideas in the book to problems in other academic disciplines. That is because all my time will be taken up with completing a high quality monograph showing the power of the system. However, my goal is to engage in such activities in the future, which will be bolstered by the publication of the proposed monograph. \n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-01-09</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-09-10</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>29363</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The framework based in this research is still being developed.

That framework is one that uses Semantics as the core conceptual tool to understand meaning. Typically, Semantics sees the core content of communicative acts in terms of representation. It uses the methods and techniques of modern logic to understand these representations. There are many anomalies to this approach to the contents of communication. These include 'paradoxes' that arise when we use logical techniques to understand vagueness, one of the pervasive features of human languages, and truth. My project is to develop a new theory of how to think of meaning based in speech-act structures and cognitive science. In this approach, there is no separate enterprise called 'Semantics'. The framework, a speech-act theoretical approach, is a general framework for understanding meaning and its relation to our underlying psychological makeup. This framework, which I now call a 'Language-Agency approach', can deal with the paradoxes that afflict Semantics. If so, it's development point to a new way of thinking of human communication.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The full development of a speech-act theoretic, Language-agency, approach that I have been developing can have serious impacts on how linguists, philosophers, and cognitive-scientists think about how human systems of communication and thought, and indeed, consciousness arise in the natural world. The main impacts are then in what we might broadly call science. However, the Language-agency approach could, further down the line, have implications for developing artificial language systems or artificially intelligent systems that can interact with humans using language.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>806F1FB7-CFCF-4FCD-A01B-0152B9A54A67</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5461019d1408d0.42807767</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3854A683-B28F-4D5A-8881-DA80331D078C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Truth-Making and the Alethic Undecidability of the Liar</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Discusiones Filosoficas</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/05ea759d63b5eb6a7debe7125e46c52d"><gtr:id>05ea759d63b5eb6a7debe7125e46c52d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Stephen Barker</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545fef9ab16b54.06610757</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A9348FA4-758E-4511-BA8F-8C1984D1AF8C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Irony and the dogma of force and sense</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Analysis</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a2f7106d03883dc22aa647f3bf7ecca6"><gtr:id>a2f7106d03883dc22aa647f3bf7ecca6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Barker S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545ff4730ac8a2.10870236</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6B646522-B2FD-47BA-8827-2942ECA321D6</gtr:id><gtr:title>Semantic paradox and alethic undecidability</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Analysis</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a2f7106d03883dc22aa647f3bf7ecca6"><gtr:id>a2f7106d03883dc22aa647f3bf7ecca6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Barker S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545fee6f3910d2.88410437</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>457E27F7-0A8D-4AB2-A27B-691D07711F94</gtr:id><gtr:title>Figurative speech: pointing a poisoned arrow at the heart of semantics</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Philosophical Studies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a2f7106d03883dc22aa647f3bf7ecca6"><gtr:id>a2f7106d03883dc22aa647f3bf7ecca6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Barker S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fc4d6878557.93395648</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B66616E6-F1FD-40B5-955A-CECB5F0C7E07</gtr:id><gtr:title>Having It Both Ways - Hybrid Theories and Modern Metaethics</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a2f7106d03883dc22aa647f3bf7ecca6"><gtr:id>a2f7106d03883dc22aa647f3bf7ecca6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Barker S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545ff3077adaf8.44008550</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E07087F7-5A0D-430C-A7E3-87005D457B68</gtr:id><gtr:title>Performatives and the Function of Truth in Semantics</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Organon F</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/05ea759d63b5eb6a7debe7125e46c52d"><gtr:id>05ea759d63b5eb6a7debe7125e46c52d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Stephen Barker</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>54611462d04989.26447461</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/H038396/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>B94A2498-60DA-4055-A957-686B6CB42654</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Linguistics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>946C0541-464B-43A5-9EE3-65C23360E959</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Philosophy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6E6227B6-029E-4DD5-8ADF-6D46BE6CEE4D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Language &amp; Philosophical Logic</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D3B0FA4C-49C7-4E19-A8D5-F19B1145C2CB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Semantics &amp; Pragmatics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
