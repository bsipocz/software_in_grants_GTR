My Innovation Placement with the NT will enhance the impact of NERC science by combining outputs from two projects (NE/J005541/1 iCOASST and NE/P01495X/1 ADJUST1.5) by analysing geomorphic interactions driven by natural and human processes operating on and adjacent to NT shorelines, which may be at risk from sea-level rise and wider coastal change. The NT has a national picture of what coastlines are at risk from change, but requires a method to apply at local scales to analyse how geomorphic processes operate, and why and when adverse change could occur at more local scales. As approximately 25% of their coast is low-lying, detecting the effects of sea-level rise is a major concern. Consequently the NT would like to better inform their management policies as to what is at risk, why and when.

I will achieve this through introducing Coastal and Estuarine System Mapping (CESM) to conceptualise connected estuary-coast-inner shelf sediment systems, including geomorphic consequences of natural and human processes. This will bring together scientific and stakeholder knowledge, creating a shared understanding of how coastal sites operate, leading to development of targeted coastal management policies. I will be supported by CESM developers at University College London and the University of Southampton.

I will test outputs from iCOASST to the Suffolk coast (an iCOASST study site), taking account of the broad processes in the sediment cell, but directing results to the ~10% of coastline owned by the NT. I will liaise with stakeholders to enrich understanding of key coastal processes, and to stimulate action between parties with multiple interests on the coast. As the NT are specifically concerned about early onset effects of sea-level rise, I will analyse potential impacts using a range of sea-level rise scenarios, informed by CESM outputs. This will help indicate the drivers of environmental change, what land is at risk and when this may occur, over the NT's planning timeframe of up to 100 years.

I will test CESM on a pilot site owned by the NT (Poole Harbour) by using existing literature from the top down, but also through participatory approaches, working with the NT and other stakeholders to understand processes from the bottom up. I will work with NT staff so they can appreciate CESM and have the potential to apply it at sites nationwide, thus encouraging continuing collaboration. The results, and the NT process of learning and understanding of the process will help inform and improve local management practices aligning to NT policies and campaigns (e.g. Shifting Shores). This could transform how the NT assesses geomorphic systems and manages change. It will help envisage long-term change, working with, rather than against the nature environment. Thus resources can be directed in an appropriate manner.

My legacy will not just be knowledge transfer of the CESM process (e.g. case study examples, guidance manual), but also a review of management options which support policies and strategies. I will feedback my findings internally in an action group meeting, and to staff members. I will also disseminate my results through the NT intranet, and where appropriate, through the wider media.

My placement will have a long-term benefit by identifying change and reviewing holistic management options, which in the long-term will benefit the wider membership and public, so helping towards conserving the coast for all stakeholders and civil society.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>28830</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/R00689X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>97FC8337-8E84-46A6-ACF2-A6047DA8C582</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>60</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environmental Engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E05CFC1B-8264-49AB-8A54-E3A86F404707</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Marine environments</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>44BF93F5-71F4-42EF-A39B-8A0F09C7DDD1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>60</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Coastal &amp; Waterway Engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B945AA77-44D5-467F-9B53-2EE3C3F550B1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Land - Ocean Interactions</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
