PARCOUR argues that contractual relationships create a specific form of governance that have important implications for the democratic legitimacy of projects for Sustainable Urban Development (SUD). More specifically by studying diverse planning tools in Brazil, UK and the Netherlands, PARCOUR will engage in the comparative evaluation of public accountability in relation to residents. It is also important to acknowledge that both the realisation of the public interest through the use of these planning tools and the accountability of the public sector in contractual processes are under researched. This topic is relevant to section 3.2.3 of the Call on &amp;quot;Governance and Democracy&amp;quot;, specifically to the &amp;quot;Poverty, inequality and vulnerability&amp;quot; section in answering &amp;quot;How governance decisions on the urban environment interact with land, property markets, rights, and the private sector. And the extent to which planning tools take account of these interactions.&amp;quot; 

The main outcome of PARCOUR will be the clear evaluation of public accountability, and clear definition of public interest, focusing on dissemination of this knowledge among public authorities with interactive research. The project has 3 phases: 1) Desk research: Understanding different ways in which the public interest is constructed and operationalised in diverse contexts; 2) Field work and analysis: Testing the legitimacy of the planning tools that are able to implement actions for the public interest; 3) Dissemination: Distributing the results to academy and practice.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>PARCOUR will fill knowledge and practice gaps in the field of urban regeneration projects with private sector involvement in terms of the role of public accountability and public interest for SUD. The focus on contractual relationships sheds light on this field, which has not been explored in a comparative manner. The impact of the project will be of value not only in the regeneration field but also through its exploration and analysis of the practice of complex governance structures. The use of a comparative perspective will further strengthen the contribution of the project by allowing us to gain a better understanding of what is peculiar to each country while revealing what transcends these peculiarities in our increasingly global world where actors, particularly private developers, often operate across continents.
Expected beneficiaries: academics and public policy makers. PARCOUR will reveal the main challenges of protecting the public interest in such projects and disseminate the results to relevant policy and decision making communities, who, otherwise, lack access to such comprehensive evaluations. Moreover, some of the potential beneficiaries will be involved in the research via the PABs. Through PABs we aim to find pathways to a wider range of organisations and actors that are influential in decision making processes. The results will be communicated in the form of regular newsletters, social media and planned publications. Finally, though indirectly, residents of regeneration areas will also profit from the results of this project. The research results will be regularly reported to the participating funding agencies.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>266268</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Regional Studies Association Conference (London)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DA7FF22B-1E7A-4926-83FC-5B199E119EE8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The PARCOUR Research Associate (Dr. David Williams) presented a paper (A comparison of public-private partnership development of previously used land in the UK) on behalf of the UK research team at the Regional Studies Association - Winter Conference, 2016, Holiday Inn Bloomsbury, London.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b6d28e36d500.74819260</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The UK team were engaged in initial desk based research to prepare deliverables as part of the project timetable, this was supplemented by site visits and initial interviews with key actors. As part of this work we were able to identify the significance of environmental and heritage regulations for the governance and their role as important planning and regulation instruments impacting on the urban development activities taking place in each of our three case studies, all of which involved water and heritage dimensions. In particular all three cases are on waterfront areas and there were various degrees of flood risk associated with each site that required engagement with the relevant environmental agencies that significantly impacted on the developments. In addition two of the sites contained list buildings which also required engagement with the relevant heritage agencies and impacted on the development of the site. We had not expected this to be the case and this has added a significant new dimension to our research that has not received much attention in the academic and policy literature on urban development and associated governance arrangements. We will pursue this avenue of investigation further in the on-going research and expect to be able to provide further, more detailed, insights on these issues.
More generally we have been able to identify the complex nature of the governance arrangements for each case study in relation to the partnerships created. In each case we have created 'institutional maps' to provide diagrammatic illustrations. In addition we are beginning to develop these institutional maps to reflect how the partnerships change over time as the developments progressed - emphasising the dynamic nature of governance arrangements. We expect to update and these further in the coming year.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings to date are only preliminary findings but they have already begun to reveal the complexity of public-private partnerships engaged in urban redevelopment processes and the associated need to, where ever possible, streamline governance arrangements in the interests of accountability and transparency. In addition our research has identified the important role that environmental and heritage regulations can have for the governance and planing/regulation of urban development involving waterfront areas. In particular the significance of 'flood risk' will alert public and private partners of the need to take this into consideration at an early stage in their plans and to work with the relevant environmental agencies from an early stage in the process. The presence of listed buildings in the development area is also something that can significantly impact on the development and this should alert those involved to include them in their planning from an early stage in the development process.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>1A9D2AEE-6479-42F2-AC8D-8F10527AB230</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56bb0729b92435.01142708</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Construction,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Retail,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.urbantransformations.ox.ac.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N011333/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C087E953-30F3-4968-B0F3-D48A5998A2B4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Civil eng. &amp; built environment</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E844174D-6A1C-4D2D-8F24-57698F7DA353</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environmental planning</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AF20B57E-E40B-45BC-85C8-DDC6F4777697</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Spatial Planning</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AECBB1F8-45A7-48B4-9FBB-31FE4206AA69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Urban &amp; Land Management</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>648B790C-8CC1-40BA-B713-BF27B871D211</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Urban Design</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>19CA55B7-20B0-41C2-825B-06F2387EB8B9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Urban Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>C11BDEA9-7D9D-4728-B6A9-31032921B328</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Newton</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
