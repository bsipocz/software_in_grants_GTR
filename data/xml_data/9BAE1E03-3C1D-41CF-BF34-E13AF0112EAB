Foodborne infections with Campylobacter and Salmonella are a major public health and economic burden in the UK. Reducing the levels of Campylobacter in the food chain is a top priority of the Joint UK Funders Strategy for Campylobacter
formulated by BBSRC, Defra and FSA in 2009. Despite significant pressure on the agricultural/industrial sector, there is no decrease in prevalence of Campylobacter infections yet. Hence the beneficiaries from new intervention strategies combine all those that are affected by the Campylobacter problem: the industry (farmers, producers and retailers), regulators and the general public. These categories will also benefit from the Salmonella work proposed here.

How will they benefit from this research?
Interventions which reduce survival of Campylobacter and Salnmon meat or in the processing environment are predicted to reduce incidence of Campylobacter infections and as such directly benefit the beneficiaries. Biofilms are a well known
vehicle and reservoir for foodborne pathogens in the processing environment, and thus a target for interventions that interfere with formation and presence of Campylobacter biofilms, which can be applied at an industrial level.
Our objectives to ensure that we will achieve the desired impact for our project are:
a) interact with government agencies (such as FSA) to assist the control of foodborne pathogens.
b) engage with media and public, by participate in public engagement and outreach programmes to contribute to the
societal impact and importance of science.
c) to give the scientists involved in the project the best possible training in molecular microbiology, genomics, bioinformatics
and appropriate transferable skills.
d) to make sure that information and tools generated are directly disseminated to scientists and food industry, to assist
rapid application to support safer food.
e) protect and exploit intellectual property that is generated during the project for economic impact</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>4661</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>We have found 3 enzymes that could degrade Campylobacter biofilms, and could potentially be used in food packaging or cleaning product applications.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2017</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>5FAE995C-39FA-471C-87C0-93287B77A210</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>58b6a00d6635c4.73455080</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>3 new enzymes that could degrade microbial biofilms and could be used in food, packaging or cleaning products.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Information will need to be publicised.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>021A16F6-AF88-46B8-AA8B-2CD2E954A432</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58b6a0c8c1ebf6.99263297</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Education,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology,Retail</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/P000274/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5B25B6A3-B218-4F11-8A9D-661236DF455C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agri-environmental science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>48D25546-6ADF-479A-8877-478CCDB1DC1F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Animal Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>455F5D87-6317-4EF0-9D74-72B5D9BD6375</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Food science &amp; nutrition</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>2607D197-52EE-40CA-A1D5-A46D18C3F97F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Microbial sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>794345CD-A1D5-4984-ADDD-088BCF41822F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agricultural systems</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4A2A69ED-37ED-4980-91A7-E54B4F6A9BC6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Animal organisms</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>649031FD-C21E-42D9-AC12-41ACA59CC11C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biochemistry &amp; physiology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>446B7E7F-04EB-4121-9CC6-9171277E00DA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Diet &amp; health</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>C7A88EDD-F02E-4CF4-B7E9-E33C946EBD49</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Food processing</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
