In line with the preference of older people and their carers to age in place, and current policy guidance, the proposed research will involve collaboration with industry partners to help them address challenges in the implementation and uptake of new technologies to support sustainable arrangements for ageing in place capable of delivering wellbeing outcomes for older people. The Fellowship aligns with 4 &amp;quot;Pillars&amp;quot; of the Industrial Strategy: 

Pillar 1 - Investing in Science, Research and Innovation. The Fellow's innovative research focuses on innovations to address the Ageing Society Grand Challenge and aims to strengthen the role of UK expertise (in services, universities, innovation) in the global market for digital care products in ICTs, 'new generation' telecare products, and robotics.
 
Pillar 3 - Upgrading Infrastructure. The digitisation of care has reconfigured approaches to care interactions, but current care UK infrastructure requires upgrading to take full advantage of innovations in this area. 

Pillar 5 - Improving Procurement. At present, procurement of care technologies relies heavily on local authorities and NHS Trusts. The research will explore how the rapidly emerging private care consumer market is influencing supply chains and its potential to drive innovation. 

Pillar 8 - Cultivating World-Leading Sectors. The UK's past role in developing new care technologies positions its innovators and universities to benefit from, and play a lead role in, the increasingly competitive global market for care technologies and services. 

The Fellow will examine challenges, benefits and possibilities for businesses and organisations designing and producing new technologies to support ageing in place. He will work closely with industry and non-academic partners to help them identify their needs and future potential, collaborating with six organisations which have already been recruited to the study and with others to be identified during the lifetime of the Fellowship. 

The research will focus on case examples of promising innovations. These will include companies developing various potentially transformative solutions, including assistive robotic systems capable of enhancing quality of life as people age; emotionally engaging and useful robot solutions for use in the homes of older people; and other technologies offering different kinds of modern care solutions attractive or useful to older people requiring care and those who provide their support (carers and care workers). The specific focus of each case will be selected in consultation with partners and through stakeholder interviews/desk research. 
 
Bespoke research techniques will be chosen, for their applicability to each case example and suitability to address research questions agreed with partners. A key issue will be to examine how suppliers of innovative products and services identify business development opportunities and access care markets. The research will include expert interviews, focused observations (in visits to the premises of partners) and analysis of documents. Methods will be qualitative (e.g. in-depth interviews, focus groups) and quantitative (e.g. surveys/analyses of company data), as applicable; the Fellow will identify/engage other stakeholders to take part if appropriate. 

The findings will show how innovators, manufacturers and suppliers view/approach challenges in the technology-enabled care market. The Fellow will work with them to discover and implement new approaches to marketing and developing sustainable products for successful ageing in place, making information available to future start-ups entering the care technology marketplace in a new industry-focused toolkit.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research?

The most direct beneficiaries from this research will be the industry/non-academic partners collaborating with the Innovation Fellow. These partners include established leaders and new start-up businesses designing and developing new technologies to support ageing in place, and professional organisations who maintain a network to aid such industry practices. Additional businesses will be identified, in collaboration with a leading organisation in the care sector and with input from Sustainable Care Programme PI Yeandle and Work Package Leaders de Witte and Hawley. Further beneficiaries will include older adults living in their own homes, their family carers, and care workers who may regularly use new technologies to support their capacity to live independently at home. More widely, policy advisers, care professionals and leaders in statutory services in the UK responsible for new Sustainable Transformation Plans in health and social care may also be interested in the findings and outputs generated by this fellowship. This wide breadth of potential beneficiaries highlights the impact this research can have across the whole system of technology-enabled care, from initial design right through to the final implementation and use of emergent technologies.

How will they benefit from this research?

The most direct beneficiaries of this research will gain a more in-depth understanding of the challenges they face and the opportunities they could seize to realise increased uptake and more effective implementation of their new technologies, helping them tackle endemic issues widely reported across the sector. High-quality articles in popular and business-specific publications will ensure good outreach to the public and to non-partner organisations alerting them to the study findings. The public will also have the opportunity to take part in two planned public engagement events linked with British Science Week and the ESRC Festival of Social Sciences. These events will allow an interested public to engage actively with insights from the study and to discuss their own perspectives on technologies designed to support older adults and their partners in care.

Industry partners and other relevant stakeholders will also benefit from a series of stakeholder engagement events held throughout the study period to openly discuss innovative practices in a model of open and responsive collaboration. A further series of action-oriented workshops will help design and refine the development of a toolkit promoting innovative strategies for successful implementation and uptake in the sector.

The Innovation Fellow will also maintain a strong web presence through engagement on social media (notably Twitter and LinkedIn) and a study-specific website. These activities will allow an interested public, nascent technology developers and other relevant stakeholders to engage with the study throughout its duration ensuring an interested readership for future study outputs. Publications will be made Open Access when possible to ensure that interested individuals and organisations can benefit from the study.

How will the the Innovation Fellow develop and sustain relationships with industry partners?

The Innovation Fellow will seek to develop relationships based on an open system of collaboration with each industry partner. The Fellow will prioritise a research agenda that is meaningful and will maximally benefit the needs of each partner whilst ensuring the delivery of a robust and rigourous empirical study. The Fellow will maintain regular email and telephone contact with each partner and generate rapport during his short placements within each organisation. The Fellow will seek to sustain his relationship with regular stakeholder meetings that focus on outputs and findings which may benefit whilst also brokering a support network for partners to collaborate with each other and relevant stakeholders.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-01-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-01-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>248697</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/S002049/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6723A70B-A523-40AB-9740-B6AD2A0677B7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medical &amp; health interface</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E88ECDEE-D58E-417E-A379-9FBB35647A90</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Science and Technology Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BF2ECBC3-83AC-4763-B527-27A84805F0F9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design Engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D6F08770-CB96-423D-89E7-3F64DE17997E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Innovation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>16595C3C-600D-4AD2-B394-16E06F96495F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Med.Instrument.Device&amp; Equip.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E88ECDEE-D58E-417E-A379-9FBB35647A90</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Science and Technology Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
