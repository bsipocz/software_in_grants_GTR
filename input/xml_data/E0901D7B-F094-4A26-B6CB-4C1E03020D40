Sergio Atzeni and the post-modern definition of Sardinian ethnic identity</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Fellowship</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/I027274/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The AHRC Fellowship is requested in order to finance the final phases of the preparation of a monograph on the Italian writer Sergio Atzeni (1952-1995).\n\nAtzeni has been defined by Ernesto Ferrero as an 'ethnic writer', whose stories draw on both the present and the mythical past of his native island, Sardinia. As well as being the author of novels, short stories, theatrical works and poetry, he worked as a journalist and as a translator from French into Italian. In the latter role, he translated essays by Claude L&amp;eacute;vy-Strauss and G&amp;eacute;rard Genette, as well as a novel by Patrick Chamoiseau. His idiolect - a refined literary Italian, open to dialects and foreign influences - is highly experimental yet accessible, personal yet communicative.\n\nWhile strongly interested in preserving cultural traditions and local identities against contemporary homologation processes, operating at both national and international level, Atzeni is also an intellectual of his time. Politically involved in the 1968 movements, passionate about pop, rock, and jazz, a voracious and omnivorous reader, his different and contrasting influences emerge clearly in his own writing. The result is a post-modern m&amp;eacute;lange, where traditions and modernity coexist and clash on the levels of content, structure, language and style.\n\nSince his premature death, Atzeni's importance as a writer has gained a wide and profound recognition. Most of his novels have been translated into French, and Il figlio di Bakun&amp;igrave;n has also appeared in Spanish and English. His short story Bellas mariposas was included in the prestigious collection Racconti italiani, edited by Enzo Siciliano for the series 'I Meridiani' (Milan: Mondadori, 1997). An entry on Atzeni was added to the Lessico Universale Italiano of the Treccani encyclopedia (2001). In 2005, the tenth anniversary of his death further increased interest in his work, with major conferences in Turin and Cagliari, new editions of his works, and also theatre and cinema tations. Nevertheless, critical attention to Atzeni has hitherto been limited to a few scholarly articles, a collection of essays by Giuseppe Marci (1997) and the proceedings of a conference edited by Marci and myself (2001). Another collection of conference proceedings (Cagliari, 2005) is scheduled in 2011. My monograph constitutes the first attempt at a coherent stylistic, structural and thematic analysis of Atzeni's oeuvre.\n\nI study Atzeni's oeuvre within the general framework of multilingualism in modern Italian novels; my approach integrates narratology, stylistics/linguistics, textual philology, and current trends in multicultural studies. My reading of Atzeni's work challenges the idea that a supposed centre still maintains its political, cultural, and linguistic supremacy over the peripheries, and - following from the influential ideas of Carlo Dionisotti and Gianfranco Contini - it reaffirms the historical vitality of polycentrism and multilingualism in Italian culture.\n\nMy study also links Atzeni's poetics to international models, especially to francophone writers from Martinique such as Patrick Chamoiseu, whose work was translated by Atzeni into Italian, and also &amp;Eacute;duard Glissant. Thus, it proposes a definition of Atzeni's writing as part of a new Italian 'internal post-colonialism'. In this respect, my research, while aiming at extending the Italian literary canon of the late twentieth century, also fits into the 'Post-colonial Europe' project run by the Institute for Colonial and Post-colonial Studies in Leeds (of which I am a member) which 'enacts the return of the colonial gaze on contemporary metropolitan European societies and cultures. The project gauges the parameters of a rapidly transforming but still hierarchically structured polity in which new transnational forms of community, citizenship and governance jostle with atavistic attitudes to identity, terror and race' (see:http://www.leeds.ac.uk/english/shared/lpsc/projects.htm).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>\nThe non-academic impact of this project can be described mainly in terms of 1) the support it offers to the promotion of new international cultural and artistic products and events, 2) its uses for pedagogical activities outside the university (in schools, for example, or in continuing education programmes), and 3) its influence on Sardinian (but also Italian, and international) socio-intellectual growth.\n\n1) To date, Sergio Atzeni has attracted the interest of many Italian intellectual and artists; several projects inspired by his work or devoted to his life are in progress at the moment, ranging from documentary and feature films to theatre productions and radio programmes. The completion of my monograph will not only provide new insights into Atzeni's biography and poetics, but will also make available for the first time new unpublished materials (letters, private notes, lectures), from which artists and general readers will benefit. At present, I am recognised as one of the leading critics working on contemporary Sardinian fiction and in particular on Atzeni's work. I have contributed as scientific consultant to a number of existing productions, and I am also involved in new ones (see the attached document Pathways to Impact). In the longer term, my aim is to co-ordinate in Italy, United Kingdom and France a series of public events centred on my monograph and/or on new texts inspired by Atzeni, thus fostering an international cultural debate on the central themes explored in his work. \n\n2) I have always devoted time to disseminate my research outside the academic field, and I will continue doing so in relation to this project. A series of book presentations will be organised in Italian and European cities, and part of the materials produced will enrich the existing official website on Sergio Atzeni. Workshops on Atzeni and on literary representations of contemporary Sardinian culture will be organised for Italian high school students, as well as for mature learners in Italian and British centres for continuing education. \n\n3) Finally, by presenting an analysis of the definition of Sardinian ethnic identity in the work of a writer at the end of the twentieth century, the project will also contribute to the socio-political debate on the specific characteristics of the island (and of minority cultures), both in the regional and national context and in the broader context of the European Union (Europe of the Regions). My analysis of literary texts will enrich understanding of ethnic identity, by showing that is not something fixed, defined since its origins and transmitted passively from one generation to the next. Instead it will present this identity as an artefact, produced and recreated differently in response to the different social and cultural needs of a given community at a specific time (or in a specific era). In this respect, literary and artistic texts can cast new light on the processes of self-representation elaborated by national communities; therefore, by presenting Sardinian people with new ways to look at their own identity in the global world, the project is likely to provoke a lively intellectual debate, leading possibly to new approaches to the making of socio-political policy.\n\nDetails on the impact activities related to this project are given in the attached document on Pathways to impact.\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>26948</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A multi-media performance based on texts by Sergio Atzeni, with live electronic music and painting, by Giacomo Casti (voice; project), Francesco Medda Arrogalla and others (music), Gianluca Marras Marjani (painting).

Sergio Atzeni's life is illustrated in the context of a peripheral, minority culture in Western Europe in the second half of the 20th century (i.e.: Sardinian society and culture of the years 1950s-1990s). 
Partially funded by the Sardinian Regional Government (Regione Autonoma della Sardegna - RAS) (?10.000,00).
I acted as an academic advisor and consultant for the general content of the film and for the selection of materials, and I am one of the people speaking in the video. In addition, the 74-minute film makes extensive use of the recording of the interviews I did with the writer before his death and with family, friends, and collaborators (old tapes).
The film has been released in 2015, in time for the celebrations of the 20th anniversary of the writer's death.
Production: Araj Film (http://www.arajfilm.it)</gtr:description><gtr:id>005D95AE-ED54-4350-9180-A97A1C0F3AF4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Director Daniele Atzeni is a winner of awards in international film festivals all over the world, especially with his last work 'I morti di Alos' (http://www.cinemaitaliano.info/pers/030887/daniele-atzeni.html). He has worked extensively on Sardinian culture and society in the 20th Century, focusing on stories from the minefields and the traditional fishing economy.
By collaborating with me on the life and work of Sergio Atzeni, the film-maker gained new knowledge on one of the main cultural interpreters of contemporary Sardinian identity. He also made use of preparatory materials produced during my research, from original, unpublished documents.

The film is being screened at Sardinian and national festivals and events, thus: 1. increasing the visibility of the writer Sergio Atzeni; 2. proposing a post-modern definition of Sardinian ethnic identity, as a minority culture in the contemporary glocal world (global + local); 3. fostering a reconsideration of the canon of Italian literature in the final decades of the 20th century, by looking at it from the peripheries (Sardinia).

My research on Atzeni and his rootedness in the city is at the centre of the collaboration with the Cagliari City Council and the Department of Culture . More precisely, my study of the writer's focus on the (sub-)working-class periphery of Is Mirrionis is now discussed by a group made of artists, architects, residents, and local teachers; the first step of this collaboration will be the literary-architectonical pathway through Is Mirrionis in occasion of the yearly manifestation Monumenti Aperti (Open Monuments; 8th-9th May 2015), that since 1997 opens monuments and buildings to the general public, with presentations by volunteers, especially students from local schools (fully sponsored by the City Council). My contribution brought to the attention of the local authorities also the relevance in for the town identity of the council houses (case INA) and small squares (piazzette) of this area, now studied by architects as examples of the post-war architecture of the town (Cagliari was heavily bombed and destroyed in WW2). It is also contributing to the work of neighbourhood militant groups that aim at improving the reputation of the area, both from an insider and an outsider perspective.

1. On 10.05.2015, a walk with residents, actors, architects and literary scholars was organised in the area where Atzeni grew up as a child and that inspired his stories, in the popular neighbourhood of Is Mirrionis: ' Alla scoperta di Is Mirrionis. Luoghi, storia e storie del quartiere, nei racconti di Sergio Atzeni e nei ricordi dei protagonisti' [For a discovery of Is Mirrionis. Places, history and stories of the neighbourhood, in the stories by Sergio Atzteni and in the memories of the protagonists]. Local cultural and political associations co-organised the event (Circolo Gramsci, Scuola Popolare). More than 100 participants left written feedback, on enthusiastic terms.

Details of the outputs are provided in the section on Artistic and Creative Products and Engagement. Here are the main areas developed:

A) Collaboration with artists on the theme: the writer and his town: Cagliari and Sergio Atzeni. E.g.:
1. 'Sergio Atzeni racconta Is Mirrionis', talk/theatre event by and with G. Sulis (researcher) and E. T. Arthemalle (actor/director), 14/10/2011, for the festival 'Al centro le periferie'12-15/10/2011
2. 'Madre Acqua' [Water Mother] (2015), Film/Biopic by director Daniele Atzeni. Partially funded by Regione Autonoma della Sardegna (RAS), ?10,000
3. 'The Island and the World'. Sardinian at Twilight - music, literature, and cinema event on Sardinia at Opera North theatre in Leeds, co-organised by Opera North and the University of Leeds, 2015
4. 'Un amico a Babele' [A friend in Babel] (reading/concert/performance by Giacomo Casti and others), 2015

B) Atzeni and Sardinian identity
Another area in which my project had an impact is the understanding of the complexities of Sardinian identity over the last 30 years, from a socio-political point of view. For example, on the basis of my studies on Atzeni and the postmodern Sardinian identity, I was asked in 2014 to analyse and comment on the sections on culture and education of the candidates to the elections for the Sardinian Regional Government. I was also contacted by the mayor of the city of Cagliari to work together on projects that link better the figure of Atzeni and the city he wrote about, and develop awareness both of the writer's worth and of the quality of the city, both for the inhabitants of Cagliari and for its tourists. The Atzeni/peripheries day for Monumenti Aperti in 2015 and 2016 (Heritage Day) is a first step in this direction. 

Many public lectures, talks, and participations to roundtables on these themes took place in Sardinia and elsewhere in 2015,, the year that marks the 20th anniversary of the writers premature death (see the 'Engagement' section). . The blog www.sergioatzeni2015.org) and the 3-day conference at the university of Bologna (September 2015) have also acted as catalysts and hubs for these and other initiatives.

Yet, it should be stressed that it is not easy to find a balance between the production of the academic outputs and the commitment to impact, knowledge-transfer events and collaborations. Different partners (e.g. academics vs. artists, vs. cultural operators) have different timescales for projects, different aims, and different financial issues, and this can create problems. A number of unpredictable factors can delay or even put a halt to this kind of collaborative projects.

Furthermore, the international financial crisis has hit dramatically Sardinia (one of the poorest regions in Italy), and consequently funding for cultural projects has been cut, or reduced, or delayed (e.g. the funding for the biopic film, 'Water Mother').

Finally, the knowledge-transfer events and activities carried out as part of this project have been important in raising my profile as an expert in Sardinian/Italian fiction, internationally. E.g. I have been asked to have a regular blog on social-cultural topics in the Sardinian 'Tiscali' platform (declined due to lack of time), and to write regularly for the Italian literary blog 'Le parole e le cose' (the collaboration started with an article on Atzeni), and for Sardinian magazines and newspapers (e.g.'Sardinews', 'SardiniaPost', 'La Nuova Sardegna', 'L'Unione Sarda').

My expertise on Atzeni and contemporary Sardinian/Italian fiction caught the attention of the editors of the 'Times Literary Supplement', who asked me a review of the English translation of fiction by the Sardinian author/politician Luigi Pintor; this started a new collaboration on broader literary and cultural themes, which is still ongoing.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>4883CB9F-92F4-42D1-9716-B2FAB40E90C3</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5464a015835093.00395194</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The AHRC-funded research allowed me to systematise and further enrich previous research done on the Sardinian writer Sergio Atzeni (1952-1995) and on Sardinian literature and culture in the second half of the 20th century. 
More specifically:
1. The first comprehensive monograph on Atzeni (1952-1995) is almost completed, and ready for publication in late 2016. It looks at: biography; paths in poetics (ethnic identity; the postmodern novel and the fragmentation of the text; orality and storytelling linguistic experimentation); analysis of variants of major novels; complete bibliography; complete critical bibliography. 
2. the post-colonial interpretative framework was confirmed as appropriate [see book chapter: Sulis 2012]
3. a new take on Italian internal post-colonialism was proposed (this allows to read contemporary Sardinian fiction as a case study of the processes of 'internal post-colonialism' within the Italian and European national cultural, artistic and literary context, and Sardinia as a case of 'internal Other' for the Italian national identity);
4. Thanks to the analysis of Atzeni's work, a change of paradigm of Sardinian self-representation was highlighted: Atzeni sees Sardinia as 'cross-road island', and not anymore as 'prison-island' (Febvre, 1922). Atzeni's interpretation of Sardinian post-modern ethnic identity has become highly influential for younger writers, hence the number of collaborations and public engagement activities that have developed from the initial project;
5. new insights on Italian postmodern fiction (esp. historical novel) were provided, thus contributing to the opening of the Italian literary canon to peripheral voices; 
6. Atzeni's use of Sardinian as an element of his multilingual Italian narrative prose is analysed as an artistically refined and intellectually thought-provoking contribution to the debate on the future of Sardinian as an endangered minority language.

I have published two original and well-received book chapters, which focuses on one aspect of the research done (Sulis 2012, Sulis 2015). The publication of the monograph has been delayed due to the unexpected abundance of new material discovered and to the difficulties in accessing part of this new material (old computer files). 

At the same time, the request for public debates, talks, classes in schools, events with artists, participation in book festivals and radio programmes, collaboration with Sardinian institutions contributions to online blogs and magazines increased exponentially, and well beyond the energies and time available for an academic. 

At that point, I agreed with my university to postpone the publication to after the closure of the REF2013, in order to have both monograph and impact activities ready for the next round of the Research Exercise Framework. Many outreach, impact and knowledge-transfer events have taken place in 2015, the year of the 20th anniversary of the writer's death. 

I have started the blog www.sergioatzeni2015.org, in which plan to store some of the materials collected during the research that cannot be incorporated in a monograph, but which will be of interest to the general public, to artists, and to intellectuals. The blog also works as a hub for the initiatives devoted to the writer.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>After this phase of the work - and the unexpected findings in terms of archival research- I plan to apply for funding both from the AHRC Follow-on Funding Scheme and to the Fondazione Banco di Sardegna (Cagliari) for a joint project with IT-experts to:
1. recover and make available in a digital platform all the archive of Sergio Atzeni, including the word-files saved from his laptop;
2. study and find solutions for the problem of the obsolescence of IT-documents over the years, which is changing very rapidly the methods of work for philologists.
This is a new area of research, on which little work has been done to date. A very good example I am looking at as a source for inspiration is the recent critical edition of the work of German writer Heinrich B&amp;ouml;ll.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>3BE9B9E0-5C8B-4CFA-87DB-D8A15A9DE6C7</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5463adb36d2986.00736293</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.leparoleelecose.it/?p=7524</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1E240A26-F460-4667-9093-1FE16EACDE37</gtr:id><gtr:title>L'identit&amp;agrave; sarda del XXI secolo - tra globale, locale e postcoloniale</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8a91053a7552aacd51c1f1c2ff345701"><gtr:id>8a91053a7552aacd51c1f1c2ff345701</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Sulis, G.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-88-6429-136-9</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>54624ee787e638.59466387</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F281E349-620E-4086-9A4D-555C56464EA9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Isola, nazione, mondo.
