It is proposed that both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the underlying inflammation in the skin, with the body's immune system playing an important role.

The aim of the proposed research is to identify novel immune pathways that may contribute to the disease process underlying eczema, by examining skin and blood samples from patients with and without eczema to identify and characterise immune cells present in the blood and skin of patients with eczema and investigate their effect on skin cell structure and function. 

Patients with eczema with important mutations known to be associated with eczema will be examined to investigate how these affect the body's immune response, and the reactivity of these immune cells to common environmental agents known to be important in eczema, such as house dust mite will be investigated.

It is likely that these studies will highlight immune pathways that will be amenable to therapeutic intervention, with the hope of developing new treatments for eczema in the future.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Atopic eczema (AE) affects 20-30% of the UK population. Both genetic and environmental factors interact to contribute to pathogenesis, with convincing evidence of both a compromise in epidermal permeability through null mutations in the filaggrin gene and a Th2 driven cutaneous inflammatory response. There is significant complexity in regulation of the skin barrier, and mechanisms by which filaggrin insufficiency leads to atopic disease are poorly understood.

In recent years, T cells recognising lipids in the context of CD1 molecules have been described, with evidence that CD1a-restricted T-cells (CRTC) circulate at higher frequencies than previously considered and can infiltrate human skin. CD1a is highly expressed by epidermal Langerhans cells which are well placed to detect barrier compromise, lesional atopic tissue carries an altered lipid profile, and CD1a+ cells are enriched within AE lesions. 

I therefore propose that epidermal CD1a-restricted T cells contribute to atopic inflammation and wish to test the hypothesis that AE is associated with an altered frequency and phenotype of CRTC by addressing the following questions in individuals with AE and non-atopic controls:

1.) What is the frequency and phenotype of CRTC in the blood and skin of atopic and control individuals with defined filaggrin genotypes?
2.) How do cytokines derived from cutaneous CRTC influence keratinocyte biology?
3.) Are CD1a-restricted T cells in atopic individuals reactive to common environmental allergens? 

Through these approaches I will identify how CRTC cytokines contribute to a milieu linking filaggrin insufficiency, CD1a+ cells, and T cells in the pathogenesis of AE.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>It is likely that the proposed research will identify disease-relevant steps in immune pathways linking CD1a Langerhans cells, T cells and keratinocytes in the pathogenesis of atopic eczema. 

These might subsequently be amenable to therapeutic intervention, resulting in the development of new topical or systemic treatments for this exceptionally common dermatological condition. If developed, these could improve the quality of life, health and output of eczema sufferers.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-08-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-08-29</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>202530</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2D38B492-B658-4CF7-A37B-FC16FCFD94DF</gtr:id><gtr:title>CD1a-restricted T cells to atopic allergens</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>World Immune Regulation Meeting 2013</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/091bb8e5b3cd63f424d02947d99d9186"><gtr:id>091bb8e5b3cd63f424d02947d99d9186</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Jarrett Rachael</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>sL13bemC8bm</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/J011029/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>7EE9741E-CF94-420A-B0AB-A7811523CF2C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Skin</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
