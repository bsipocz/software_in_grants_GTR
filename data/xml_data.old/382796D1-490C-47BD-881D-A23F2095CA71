The aim of the project is to extend the positive impact of the 'Design Thinking for Prison Industries' (DTPI) programme by 'scaling out' the delivery model to prison staff and those delivering criminal justice education programmes from public, private and third sector organisations in the UK. We will do this by developing the educational resources for digital dissemination and further refining the delivery, volunteering and enterprise models created and tested within the pilot project. Fulfillment of this aim requires the development and dissemination of three elements of the DTPI programme:

A. Models
i. The unique DTPI model for design education developed within a prison industries setting, communicating the 'theory of change' linked to 'design thinking and making' as restorative/transformative enterprise. This approach can help inmates understand different ways of being self-employed and the entrepreneurial opportunities available to them.
ii. The model for equipping postgraduate prison volunteers with the necessary skills to provide mentoring and one-to-one facilitation of inmate learners, within a design-led DTPI programme, is unique. This model also offers a proven and pragmatic way of delivering the 'graduates into prison agenda' recommended by the Coates Review (2016), commissioned by the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) to improve effective education in prison.
iii. The social enterprise model developed within the existing DTPI programme offers a new way for prison industries to meet the additional costs of programmes such as 'Makeright', a DTPI sub-project which enables inmates to co-design and produce commercial anti-theft bags (www.makeright.org) to support sustainability in a climate of economic austerity.

B. Resources
The FoF project will further develop and share the Makeright learning and teaching resources that deliver design thinking education that aims to build inmate empathy, resilience and entrepreneurship, as well as teaching for anti-theft bag design within UK prison textiles studios. The existing resources have been iteratively developed via the AHRC/British Council (Unbox) and Serco-funded pilot at HMP Thameside, London, and Sabarmati Jail, Ahmedabad. Whilst our evaluation of them shows that they are effective, we now need to re-design them in a form that is appropriate and accessible for use by other qualified delivery agencies in prison industry settings. The objective is to work with these agencies in the development and testing of the resources before finalisation. 

C. Continuous Professional Development (CPD) and DTPI Training Module
The project will also develop and test a 'train the trainer' programme for those in prison, design education and third sector agencies wanting to deliver similar projects based on our resources connected to local prison industry settings. Inmates who have worked on Makeright, when interviewed, tell us that they recognise that self-employment may be the most viable route to employment for them once they leave prison, in part because of stigma attached to being an ex-offender. Consequently, the Makeright knowledge exchange model and strategy has the capacity to build resilience and so is incredibly useful to prisons struggling to find employment for inmates.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The press interest in the project to date is a strong indicator of its potential for impact; our ambition is to bring four constituencies into dialogue, including:
- The crime and justice community, which is interested in what works in prison and how it might lead to 'desistance' (Maruna 2001; Laub &amp;amp; Sampson 2001); in particular those who are looking to build inmate resilience for the world of work. 
- The academic design research community, which is interested in how social design education and action research can be applied, linked to innovative methodologies and cross-disciplinary approaches to help democratise innovation and transform lives.
- The business and entrepreneurial communities, which can contribute to enterprise strategies and learn how projects such as this enhance public services in sustainable ways, which may lead to improve service delivery, economic benefits and employment opportunities for inmates.
- Social innovators, such as Forum for the Future, which are interested in how to manage change and change leadership, and to help communities build resilience.
 
The DTPI/Makeright project has already received press attention internationally, but our new focus on dissemination intends to join up diverse communities in prison that do not usually connect in order to deliver impact by explaining how the process of the project is significant, more significant than the anti-theft bags generated. It will do this by: 
- providing more inmates in the national context with educational process resources aimed at finding new ways to catalyse change and reduce repeat offending, through design education, in particular design thinking skills
- publishing account/s of how inmates' personal, social, artistic and professional skills including building empathy, trust and teamwork that impact on their lives and their engagement with wider society can be understood and addressed by prison industries and prison education
- introducing inmates to new opportunities linked to self-employment narratives that will be further researched
- helping to build empathy for crime victims and understanding of RJ processes. There is significant evidence that design processes, methods and tools generate empathy for users when they design objects for others; the team intends to develop these links and create systemic follow-on programme/course opportunities for inmates interested in RJ.
 
The creative outputs generated by the project (not just anti-theft bags designed by inmates but system design and process methods about design creativity synthesised by the research team and built into the Makeright educational materials created) are likely to be further exhibited by museum education and learning teams who already engage with criminal justice exhibitions, including the Koestler Foundation, ClinkArts and NCJAA. It is also likely that the creativity of the inmates and the objects they produce in numerous prisons linked to Makeright programmes will lead to further opportunities for exhibition in diverse spaces including the Design Museum and possibly the Tate, and thus directly address every level of education. Formal learning groups such as secondary school programmes in design and technology will benefit from new forms of design analysis that this project offers, linked to accounts of the design process, as well as to the impact of 3D visualisations of anti-theft bags. Museum visitors may be another audience segment who will gain from learning about how creativity can transform lives, in addition to prison staff who will see from the project outputs how design thinking can make a difference and produce functional and beautiful commercial objects as well as change behaviour and mindsets. Beyond these likely impacts and gains, there are more speculative ones relating to how social cohesiveness can by supported by (and can support in turn) a wider state of community safety and perception of fair and satisfying justice.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>80484</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/R00157X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>608431EA-925E-44D8-A1E2-8C24B4768085</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>CB259E50-E91D-4DCD-A395-BF252E8692B8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Criminology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9E4BDAC2-CD51-4625-BCC1-5F768EE168D0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>2F0BA056-5E00-4769-9080-8085A23EC6F5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Entrepreneurship</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
