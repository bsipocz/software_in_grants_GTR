Pathogens</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/M027481/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the most critical challenges facing science in the 21st century. For decades we have benefited from the widespread availability of drugs to treat a variety of conditions using antibiotics with penicillin becoming one of the most recognizable drugs in terms of public awareness. However, through the natural evolution of pathogens, accelerated by the over-use of antimicrobial drugs, the effectiveness of current treatments to such interventions is reducing. Indeed the emergence of pathogens which are fully resistant to antimicrobial drugs, though limited, is becoming an increasing trend. As a direct result of the serious implications and threats this poses the UK has established a 5-year AMR challenge to researchers, mirrored internationally, to address these issues.

In considering AMR it is important that the risk to human health from the emergence of AMR in livestock is also recognized and addressed. The use of antibiotics in this context is also widespread, and the emergence of AMR is occurring as seen in human pathogens. Given the food chain, and environmental factors such as waste treatment and run-off, there is significant risk that this may offer a pathway for the translation of AMR pathogens from animals into humans.

Much of the study into AMR and its emergence has naturally been undertaken by researchers within the life sciences. However, researchers within the engineering and physical sciences (EPS) have for many years contributed strongly to the development of life and medical sciences through the development of new characterization tools, advanced mathematical modelling techniques, and through the development of increasingly smart sensors to give a few examples. There is therefore significant scope for engaging EPS researchers directly with addressing the AMR challenges with the aim of accelerating the development of new techniques and tools for identifying and addressing the problem.

This project will create a space in which we will bring together researchers from the EPS community, including many leaders of their field, with those directly tackling AMR research challenges in the life sciences. We will do this through the creation of a Collaborative Hub for Advancing Interdisciplinary Research (CHAIR) at the University of Surrey. This CHAIR will be based in the newly established School of Veterinary Medicine, providing a neutral space to engage with researchers from across the EPS Departments within the University. To support and facilitate collaborations focused on addressing the AMR challenges we will run a series of integrated seminars, workshops and networking events which will lead to 'sandpits' at which researchers will work to propose short collaborative projects. Successful projects will then be eligible to apply to receive further funding with the aim of generating full research proposal submissions to funding bodies on the AMR challenges. We will also provide support in terms of research time to short projects, funds for short-term missions to support researcher interaction and information exchange, and network formation. 

A series of researcher development and training activities will be offered in collaboration with the University's Researcher Development Programme. We will also closely engage with a number of strategic partners including the Defra Animal and Plant Health Agency, the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD), The National Physical Laboratory (NPL), The Royal Surrey County Hospital, and internationally at North Carolina State University (USA) including supporting a short-term visiting appointment, and Universidad Sao Paulo (Brazil). This will significantly extend the potential impact of the activities we will support and provide new opportunities for wider collaboration.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from the research?

The development of new collaborations between EPS and life science researchers to address AMR challenges will be of benefit across Government and society. The challenges faced are significant and of high importance, hence supporting new approaches to address them, if successful, will be a valuable contribution.

It is not often that an activity has this potential to deliver such broad-ranging impact that will be of benefit to a wide range of stakeholders and end users, outside of academia and industry, including funders of research and policy makers, government, healthcare institutions and those delivering it, education, the 'third sector' and the wider public, and the UK.

How will they benefit from this research?

Having initiated and been involved in defining the challenges we are addressing, funding bodies and stakeholders that they represent will benefit from the progress we make. The outcome of our research will inform and provide direct support for future research-programme prioritisation relating to these challenges. As new collaborations are developed, leading to new materials, technologies, and understanding applied to the issues surrounding AMR, other funders of research in different discipline areas will also benefit as the outcomes are translated into applications elsewhere. similarly, those developing future technologies and undertaking research and development in industry to address the AMR challenges will benefit from this project.

The UK will benefit from the creation of new cross-disciplinary collaborations and research undertaken, not only through the above contributions (and those described in the pathways to impact) to policy, industry, education etc., but by the consolidation of a leading competitive position in the development of next-generation technologies and approaches to address AMR. This will translate into the wider benefits of increased competitiveness in research and development, attracting further talent to the UK.

The outputs of the research proposed here will be of great benefit to policy makers such as Defra, FSA and EFSA. In addition it will be of great benefit to the scientific community. Commercial concerns will also benefit from the data generated as it may facilitate the development of novel antimicrobials and dosing regimes.

Much of the data generated from the project will be made publicly available. Furthermore, the PI and CI have strong links with other research groups, Defra, FSA, EFSA and commerce and thus will ensure information is appropriately communicated. We bring together leading experts and expect the medium to long-term impact will be felt beyond academics in the direct field of AMR, for example by:

Industry - Defining the mechanisms of AMR and the potential control strategies will be of interest to industry. Predictions &amp;amp; reagents arising from this work will be scrutinised for IP.

Policy makers - Improved strategies are required to control AMR in food-producing animals (pigs cattle and poultry in particular). A better understanding of AMR and its control will aid the effective targeting of resources &amp;amp; policy.

Food producers &amp;amp; consumers - By aiding the rational design of strategies to control AMR in food-producing animals this project will enhance animal welfare. Therefore, potential exists to improve economic &amp;amp; societal prosperity. Controlling AMR in animals will also reduce AMR transfer to humans and thus improving human health.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>461853</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University College London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Chemistry</gtr:department><gtr:description>Grant application: Manufacturing with Light 2: Photocleavable Antibody Drug Conjugates (pADCs) EP/N018192/1</gtr:description><gtr:id>11E0726B-8894-4C6C-A8F0-69C1F4E9C973</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Grant application to EPSRC : EP/N018192/1 (Not funded).

Our novel approach to achieving this marks a clear departure from alternatives, and is based on the use of light as a 'green' reagent. Our previous demonstration of efficient photouncaging using visible and lower energy near-infrared light, thus avoiding the need for ultraviolet photons, was a key enabling step that justifies the full study now proposed.

Specifically, we aim to enable a new class of more efficient photo-triggered drug delivery systems to be developed.
Our novel approach to achieving this marks a clear departure from alternatives, and is based on the use of light as a 'green' reagent. Our previous demonstration of efficient photouncaging using visible and lower energy near-infrared light, thus avoiding the need for ultraviolet photons, was a key enabling step that justifies the full study now proposed. In this work we will explore the limits of what may be achieved using photocleavable Antibody Drug Conjugates (pADCs) to advance beyond current research horizons, where existing approaches have failed.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Wollongong</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Australia, Commonwealth of</gtr:country><gtr:description>UGPN Partnership and Visit</gtr:description><gtr:id>204B9A58-C206-4925-89BD-900B3AC550F7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The collaboration is multi-disciplinary.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dee676c8fd49.95597492-2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>There are plans for future collaborative initiatives.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>A visit was made to the University of Wollongong by Richard Curry with colleagues from the University of Surrey as part of the University Global Partnership Network which Wollongong has recently joined.
