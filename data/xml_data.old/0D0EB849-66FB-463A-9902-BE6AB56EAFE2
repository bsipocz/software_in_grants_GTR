During the 1980's clinical BT began to appear in flocks of native Indian breeds of sheep, particularly in the southern states, possibly as a result of exotic strains of the virus introduced via sheep-breeding programmes. This change in epidemiology led to outbreaks among family-based subsistence farming communities in these areas, and BTV has since been become a significant constraint in both the rearing and productivity of indigenous flocks. In addition, in rain-fed agricultural areas, massive periodic outbreaks of disease occur that are thought to be related to the influence of timing and intensity of monsoon conditions on populations of vectors responsible for spreading BTV. Due to the circulation of 21 serotypes of BTV in southern India and the prohibitive costs of vaccination to the vast majority of the population, vector control remains the only feasible way of combating BTV transmission in the field. Despite this, virtually no quantitative data concerning the efficiency of available techniques in this role is available to inform control strategies. We will adopt a multidisciplinary approach involving mathematical modelling, entomology and chemical ecology to examine the epidemiology of BTV in the southern Indian states and to produce prediction, monitoring and mitigation techniques that can reduce the impact of BT in this region. Initially we will characterise southern India using mapping techniques that delineate land areas according to climate and land use patterns. We will then establish field sites across the region that are representative of both these factors and also the types of husbandry employed (with an emphasis on small holdings and landless husbandry workers). Having characterised these sites, we will then use light trapping to define adult seasonality and distribution and ground truth this survey with direct collection of Culicoides from livestock. These studies will be combined with detection of BTV within collected individual midges to define regional variation in which species are involved in transmission in southern India for the first time. The larval development sites of major vector species identified will then also be characterised via field investigations. Using data generated on adult seasonality, larval habitat preference and historic surveys of BT cases across southern India, we will then model the relationship between monsoon conditions and adult Culicoides/BT activity to assess the potential to produce an early warning system for major BTV epidemics based on meteorological variables. The provision of fundamental epidemiological knowledge will also enable an assessment of husbandry-based control techniques for Culicoides that could be employed to reduce BTV transmission by subsistence farmers in a cost-neutral fashion. We will examine traditional and novel means of control, both in the laboratory and in the field. The former will include the use of larval site modification, or targeted treatment with traditional, low environmental impact, insecticidal products available to villagers and additionally the use of stabling. In addition, information regarding host location by identified vector Culicoides will allow novel intervention strategies based upon the application of masking semiochemicals that could also reduce the use of synthetic insecticides by these communities in the medium term. The effect of combinations of these techniques will be examined via monitoring viral infection in livestock, as a gold standard for evidence of impact in the field. These data will then be assessed for integration into the everyday lives of user groups as part of wider dissemination frameworks for improvement of ruminant productivity and control of vectors of human and veterinary pathogens.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>This project takes a multidisciplinary approach to understanding epidemiology of the ruminant disease, bluetongue (BT), in India, with a view to developing tools for accurate risk assessment and appropriate, low-cost vector control. In India bluetongue virus (BTV) imposes the major constraint on sheep rearing - with subsistence farming communities in the south being most severely affected due to periodic, monsoon-driven hyperendemic outbreaks. Vector control is currently the only option for disease management, since co-circulation of many BTV strains and expense of vaccines render protective immunisation unachievable. Our team combines specialists in veterinary medicine, entomology, chemical ecology, ecological modelling and remote sensing with long term surveillance datasets and field-based experiments to deliver for India, the first assessment of key midge vectors involved in transmission, an in-depth understanding of the environmental conditions that drive midge population increases and that, in turn, drive the timing and locations of BT epidemics and hyper-epidemics, as well as a thorough evaluation of current and novel technology for vector surveillance and control. These will be integrated into a framework for risk assessment of BTV epidemics and design of optimal strategies for low cost vector control.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The main beneficiaries of the knowledge generated by this project fall into three main groups (listed in order of importance): 1. Subsistence sheep farming communities living within rain-fed agricultural systems in southern India that cannot afford the use of vaccination for bluetongue virus. Through a detailed dissemination plan, our project will provide this group with: (a) advice on optimal husbandry methods for minimising the likelihood of BTV transmission (b) knowledge on when the 'high-risk' transmission period is likely to occur in their region (c) information on how to delineate and remove midge breeding sites (targeted at key vector species) in and around farms (d) advice on the effectiveness and practical implementation of existing and new, low cost, vector control measures to reduce midge populations The widespread uptake of low cost, environmentally friendly vector control options would bring benefits for biodiversity and human health in India in the short to medium term. 2. Larger operators for which immunisation of stock with newly developed vaccines might be practical in the medium term. Early warning systems of major BTV epidemics have the potential to be used to increase uptake of vaccines and hence ameliorate the worst effects of outbreaks. 3. Policy makers responsible for managing bluetongue across India and the academic community including vector control specialists, epidemiologists and veterinarians. This group will benefit from: (a) A ranking of the midge species in southern India by the importance they play in bluetongue virus transmission (b) A thorough understanding of the seasonal conditions favouring high abundance of key midge vectors and high levels of bluetongue virus transmission in India (c) An evaluation of the importance of monsoon conditions in driving hyperepidemic outbreaks of BTV (d) An evaluation of whether key vectors and common strains of bluetongue virus are favoured by different combinations of seasonal conditions (e) Regional scale predictive maps showing the distribution of suitable habitat for each key vector species (f) Regional scale predcitive maps showing the probable annual timing of transmission in different areas of southern India (g) Interactive tools for forecasting monsoon driven epidemics on the basis of annual meteorological conditions (h) Development of novel field techniques for midge control and surveillance (i) A paper-based assessment of new and existing field control techniques for midges in relation to (i) control options for other vectors and (ii) how these can be integrated into current farming practices of both large and small holders. Communication with small and large holders will be established through the Directorate of Information and Publications on Agriculture, which is part of ICAR, has huge experience in disseminating information to husbandry workers and will provide outlets for publicising the project in the media. In addition to exchanging information directly with farmers in the field study in southern India, project results will be published in trade magazines and leaflets and through the media, in addition to peer-review articles. During field visits to India, seminars will be carried out by the project team within institutions involved in the All India Network on Bluetongue and beyond (e.g. National Institute of Malaria Research, Delhi and the Vector Control Research Centre, Pondicherry). The wider academic community will be reached via publications (in open-access journals) and through presentations at international conferences. This will generate added value of providing useful training for the PhD student and PDRAs in dissemination activities. Expertise in remote sensing, GIS and predictive modelling of vector-borne diseases will be exchanged, primarily through the training of the project PhD student.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-27</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-12-28</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>487754</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>'Bluetongue and Culicoides in India'.

In year one of the project initial stratified agro-ecozonations for southern India were completed based on synoptic temperature and precipitation data. Southern India classified into areas sharing similar monsoon conditions and overlaid with data reflecting other abiotic and biotic factors that are known to influence bluetongue transmission. The project was also expanded for initially operating only in Tamil Nadu to also including the neighbouring states of Andrha Pradesh and Karnataka. With regards to the understanding of how geographic variation in monsoon conditions influence BTV epidemics, models of bluetongue distribution for Karnataka state were developed using a range of techniques. The influence of temporal variation in monsoon conditions on epidemics were also examined using data already available from Andhra Pradesh at state level to develop appropriate time series models that will be required for completion. A questionnaire was also designed to define village level-factors that may influence BTV transmission and to assess uptake of Culicoides control methods across southern India. This questionaire was discussed in dedicated meetings with local veterinary personnel in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and the UK by project workers. Training was conducted across the four participating institutes in India in Culicoides surveillance, identification (both by morphology and by molecular assays) and ecological classification. These training sessions were reinforced by the construction of a centralised online database for both methodologies and reporting. 



In year two of the project a wide range of datasets were collected and complied for statistical analysis through contacts in the Indian Council for Agricultural Research (ICAR) and the Project Directorate on Animal Disease Monitoring and Surveillance (PD_ADMAS). These included a 30 year time series of monthly outbreaks of BTV recorded in each district, Village level distribution and timing of outbreaks (sourced directly from reports) and national sero-survey data. The soucing of village level data in particular exceeded original expectations and will allow distribution of BTV outbreaks to be interrogated at a greater level of detail than previously attempted in India during year three of the project. Geographical remotely-sensed models of suitability for bluetongue outbreaks, developed during the previous reporting period, have been updated with the new village level datasets (which were initially unavailable). The resulting prediction maps provide an improved contrast between suitable and unsuitable areas (e.g. western ghat region).Time series models of factors precipitating hyper-endemic outbreak years are completed at the state level and are to be finalised for publication in year three of the project. Techniques used included seasonal ARIMA models, wavelet analysis and Bayesian mixed models. These have revealed that severe outbreak years and the timing of onset within a year is determined by seasonal conditions of precipitation and temperature in the focal year, plus longer term interannual cycles driven by the impacts of El Nino (extrinsic) and the cycle of herd replacement (intrinsic) affecting herd immunity. District level time series analysis will be completed in early 2013. Questionnaire data collation is fully completed for Tamil Nadu and will be completed in the remaining two states during year three of the project. Initial analysis of the data from Tamil Nadu is revealing interesting commonalities in husbandry methods, some of which may be expected a priori to increase contact rates between livestock and Culicoides vectors. 



Standardised methodologies for the identification of collected Culicoides to species level have been partially defined in year two using morphological and molecular methods. Training and supporting material has been provided to all Indian project partners during two extended field trips and images have been collated and used to produce a basic identification guide available to partners via the project databse. A preliminary library of mtCOI DNA barcodes with matched slide-mounted morphological voucher specimens has also been established. This library of matched high-quality digital images of slide-mounted morphological specimens and COI sequence data will be expanded, analysed and publically released as new species and additional specimens of identified species are collected from a range of geographic locations during year three of the project. Currently several major vector species (and species groups) have been identified from studies including the afrotropical C. imicola. Roll-out of surveillance techniques to field sites based on ecozonation developed as part of year one is on-going. Culicoides trapping has been initiated in all three states. Preliminary emergence trapping studies have also been conducted assessing the prevalence of Culicoides larval habitat on farms. These acted as a proof of concept and demonstrated that C. imicola (a probable BTV vector in this region) had a strong association with drainage ditches on farms. More focussed studies will now be conducted in year three. A field based study was also conducted in Tamil Nadu using a breed of sheep commonly utilised by subsistence farmers in this region (Madras Red). Sheep were treated according to common husbandry practises that aim to reduce biting and nuisance fly load (application of neem oil; burning of neem oil in close proximity to livestock; treatment with deltamethrin). Results were generally disappointing with burning of neem oil failing to reduce local populations of Culicoides around animal housing. In addition, Culicoides exposed to deltamethrin treated hair showed no significant reduction in survivourship over time.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The outputs of this research will allow more accurate decision making in BTV intervention strategies at a local, state and national level in India. The tools that we will provide enable a means of predicting spatial and temporal occurance of BTV with a view to driving vaccination campaigns and/or implementation of Culicoides control. We will additionally define the impact of interventions at a village level be measuring the effect of control techniques on Culicoides quantitatively for the first time. This will enable improvements to be made in wide-scale education for farmers to combat this disease. Throughout the project, the provision of data and models of monsoon-driven BTV epidemics and control techniques for Culicoides using already existing technologies is on a purely non-commercial basis. Outputs of potential impact will be identified initially from experimentation (e.g. models that accurately portray the effect of monsoon conditions on Culicoides populations, management techniques that have a demonstrable impact upon BTV transmission). Techniques will then be assessed with regard to their integration with other early warning systems of epidemic disease in India or in the wider context of the control of vector-borne disease and improvement of small holding efficiency, as appropriate, in collaboration with other dissemination frameworks. These have the potential to be published both as formal review articles for a primarily scientific audience and also in trade magazines and as part of leafleting campaigns (which are already commonly used for BTV control by ICAR and local agencies). The project will also provide crucial information regarding cost-neutral methods of control that will be disseminated in a similar fashion. These sustainable and integrated approaches to the control of BTV will impact upon quality of life of local people as well as animal welfare.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8C16E76D-950B-4BE5-BF92-724B3A8503AB</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-1064258116.3572688774ae36a</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.ibvnet.com/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>India Strategy Meeting</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>54019439-DEE7-416D-8B78-C9EDE37AA30B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Meeting In India during 2014 with key policy makers to inform use of GIS in India to map BTV.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545f5a1a582735.93716364</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/web/FILES/Publications/uk-india-bluetongue-research.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F21BDFDE-37B7-41E4-B48F-6C73C787473C</gtr:id><gtr:title>DNA barcoding and surveillance sampling strategies for Culicoides biting midges (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) in southern India.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Parasites &amp; vectors</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/651b180b68b4930ce6e21f1d79e56725"><gtr:id>651b180b68b4930ce6e21f1d79e56725</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Harrup LE</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1756-3305</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>57fe0615bea3e2.24548366</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>FE9E0013-58CA-4122-B9F8-0CBE9649FA8A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Bionomics of temperate and tropical Culicoides midges: knowledge gaps and consequences for transmission of Culicoides-borne viruses.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Annual review of entomology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/47c74ac2cb460dec7c40f660802d93aa"><gtr:id>47c74ac2cb460dec7c40f660802d93aa</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Purse BV</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0066-4170</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5675dcb988d37</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9111572D-397B-496C-8783-14394027B7AD</gtr:id><gtr:title>Insecticidal effects of deltamethrin in laboratory and field populations of Culicoides species: how effective are host-contact reduction methods in India?</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Parasites &amp; vectors</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/49444f1ef7c5116416598cb5980ce8a2"><gtr:id>49444f1ef7c5116416598cb5980ce8a2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>De Keyser R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1756-3305</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58983d3203bc83.63327575</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/H009205/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
