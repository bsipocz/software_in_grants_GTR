Her ability to do this reliably depends on her years of training in interpreting such images and on her overall level of confidence that the target selection is correct. This example highlights two important phenomena underpinning human cognition. Firstly, training and experience can induce long-lasting improvements in our ability to detect, identify and make decisions based on ambiguous sensory information; a phenomenon commonly known as perceptual learning. Secondly, decision confidence - the degree of belief that one's choice is likely to be correct - can inform our decisions further by providing a graded assessment of expected outcome. Despite the prevalence and obvious utility of these phenomena in everyday life (e.g. learn about our surroundings to make better predictions and plan future actions), their neural substrates and how they can be used to build intelligent machines to improve human decision making when solving important socioeconomic problems remain elusive.

Modern neuroimaging methods made it possible to &amp;quot;take a peak&amp;quot; into the human brain. Human electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive method whereby electrodes placed on the surface of the scalp measure the brain's electrical activity. This technique provides precise information on when the brain processes information in time. In contrast, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measures (non-invasively in an MRI scanner) changes in the local blood flow in the brain as we process information. This in turn allows one to identify where in the brain this processing takes place. Here we propose to combine these two methods to simultaneously obtain information on when and where the brain processes information relating to perceptual learning and decision confidence while human participants engage in various decision making tasks. 

Crucially, after deciphering the behavioural and neurobiological origins of learning and confidence during decision making we will develop a brain-computer interface system (computer program controlled in part by human brain signals) that exploits these decision correlates to optimise human performance when dealing with problems relying on inconclusive or partially ambiguous evidence in areas such as security (e.g. optimise systems for threat detection), global economy (e.g. optimise marketing and investment strategies) and health and wellbeing (e.g. identify prognostic precursors of cognitive ageing and disorders known to compromise ones decision-making faculties).

The main translational output of our work will be a prototype system for fast and intelligent image triaging of large image/video repositories (e.g. CCTV, satellite, advertising image databases). The sheer volume, diversity and sparsity of items of interest in these databases render a manual search for targets of interest very ineffective. Our system will improve human performance (i.e. targets detected per unit time) by presenting a large amount of images in rapid succession (i.e. increase throughput relative to manual search) and re-prioritise the image sequence, placing those that are more likely to contain a target of interest in the front of an image stack. Re-prioritising will be achieved in real-time, by intercepting (non-invasively) brain signals that are indicative of ones decision about a potential target of interest while exploiting signatures of learning and confidence as identified above.

This work will be performed collaboratively with our international partners at Columbia University in New York. Together, we started to use cutting-edge technology and analysis tools that allow us to characterise and exploit neural signatures associated with human decision making (this work was recently featured in a BBC Horizon documentary).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Economic, social and public policy impact: Being able to tap into the neural processes of human decision making can provide the platform for developing technologies that help inform a variety of socioeconomic problems. The key translational aspect of our work (to be delivered at project completion) is the design of a prototype system for brain-informed image triaging. Image and video repositories are growing at an exponential rate and as a result the efficient searching of these databases, given their size, diversity and sparsity of items of interest, has become a major problem. Crucially, this problem arises in domains as diverse as intelligence image analysis (e.g. identifying targets of interest and exposing security threats) and marketing (e.g. informing advertisement strategies and product design).

To date, search technologies in intelligence image analysis rely heavily on computer vision programs to explore the relevant databases despite being less effective than human image analysts (IAs) who are limited in number relative to the enormous amount of imagery available. Similarly, multimedia search for identifying effective advertisement material rely mainly on cumbersome market research tools (e.g. surveys/questionnaires). Our work will have direct impact on these and related tasks by utilising neural correlates of decision making to optimise image search and improve IAs performance relative to manual search.

Our system will dramatically increase throughput by presenting an IA with a large amount of images in rapid succession and re-prioritising the order in which the images are later scrutinised (using real-time, non-invasive brain signals), by placing those that are more likely to contain task-relevant information in the front of an image stack. The system can have a wide range of applications in remote sensing, multimedia search, neuromarketing, advanced gaming interfaces etc. We aim to further develop this technology through well-established links with industrial partners (see Pathways to Impact). We believe the system can have direct benefits for a number of organisations in government/MoD (e.g. remote sensing and intelligence image analysis) and the private sector (e.g. marketing and multimedia search). 

As optimal decision making is at the heart of strategic planning, providing a mechanistic account of human decision making can also have wider, long-term, socioeconomic impact on problems ranging from policy making and risk management to informing individual decisions on health behaviours and savings strategies. Furthermore, identifying reliable markers of decision confidence in particular can help inform problems that rely on inconclusive or partially ambiguous evidence (e.g. medical diagnosis and treatment) by providing a probabilistic assessment of expected outcome such that alternative actions are better evaluated. 

Health and Wellbeing: In normal and abnormal cognitive ageing, even simple decision making is affected, as evidenced by changes in behavioural measures such as accuracy and response time. In addition, a large number of disorders known to compromise ones decision-making faculties (e.g. ADHD, Schizophrenia, autism, personality disorders) can also lead to similar behavioural changes. The imaging tools proposed here could provide a useful tool for characterising the neural changes that are causal to these behavioural changes and lead to the development of new methods for identifying diagnostic and prognostic indicators of cognitive deficits and more directed behavioural and pharmacological treatments at a much earlier stage. This is another very tangible goal, which we plan to pursue as soon as we roll out the first results from this study. To this end we already established links with local colleagues - experts in ageing and mental disorders (see Pathways to Impact) - to formally test whether such prognostic indicators can be used in the clinic.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>503724</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Columbia University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Brain computer interfaces for augmenting decision making</gtr:description><gtr:id>71B158E3-E5DD-43DE-8BBC-59721AC54825</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Disciplines involved: neuroscience, psychology, engineering, computer science</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54562cc1a400d5.16552529-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Our partner at Columbia University is an expert in the development of brain computer interface (BCI) systems and will take the lead in developing the actual BCI platform required for the project as highlighted above.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Agreement established in October 2014.

Her ability to perform this task successfully depends on her years of experience in interpreting such images. This example highlights that training and experience are required to induce long-lasting improvements in our ability to make decisions based on ambiguous sensory information a phenomenon commonly referred to as perceptual learning. Despite the prevalence and obvious utility of this phenomenon in everyday life (e.g. learning in an ever-changing environment to make better predictions and plan future actions), its neural substrates and how these affect decision-making remain elusive.

An emerging view in perceptual learning is that improvements in perceptual sensitivity are not only due to enhancements in early sensory representations but also due to changes in post-sensory decision processing. In humans, however, direct neurobiological evidence of the latter account remains scarce. Here, we trained participants on a visual categorization task over three days and used multivariate pattern analysis of the electroencephalogram to identify two temporally-specific components encoding sensory (Early) and decision (Late) evidence, respectively. Importantly, the single-trial amplitudes of the Late, but not the Early component, were amplified in the course of training and these enhancements predicted the behavioural improvements on the task. Correspondingly, we modelled these improvements with a reinforcement learning mechanism, using a reward prediction error signal to strengthen the readout of sensory evidence used for the decision. We validated this mechanism through a robust association between the model's decision variables and our Late component's amplitudes indexing decision evidence (see Diaz et al., Nature Human Behaviour, 2017). 

We are currently following up these experiments by coupling single-trial electroencephalography (EEG) with simultaneously acquired functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). An EEG machine records brain activity with high temporal precision (&amp;quot;when&amp;quot; things are happening in the brain) while functional MRI provides information on the location of this activity (&amp;quot;where&amp;quot; things are happening in the brain). To date, &amp;quot;when&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;where&amp;quot; questions have largely been studied separately, using each technique in isolation. By combining the two techniques we plan to map out the full spatiotemporal dynamics of the brain networks associated with perceptual learning.

The other aim of our study was to study the role of subjective confidence in decision making. Our everyday lives involve frequent situations where we must make judgments based on noisy or incomplete sensory information, such as whether it is safe to cross the street on a foggy morning, when visibility is poor. Being able to rely on an internal estimate of whether our perceptual judgments are accurate is therefore fundamental to adaptive behaviour. Correspondingly, recent years have seen a growing interest in understanding the neural basis of confidence judgments.

Most human studies to date have used fMRI to identify the regions of the brain encoding confidence at the time of metacognitive evaluation (i.e., while subjects actively judge their performance following a choice). In this work we collected simultaneous EEG-fMRI data to map out the full spatiotemporal dynamics of the role of confidence in decision making, starting as early as the decision process itself. In doing so we first analysed the EEG data to temporally characterise perceptual confidence, and identified an early component, which reliably discriminated between High vs. Low confidence choices. Next, we exploited the trial-by-trial variability in this neural signature to inform the analysis of the fMRI data in order to identify the brain regions involved, thereby characterising decisional confidence with both high temporal and high spatial precision. Importantly, these endogenous neural signatures of confidence represent a graded neural response that hold a more accurate representation of internal confidence than can be captured by behavioural ratings alone, and thus have the potential to reveal latent brain states that may not otherwise be visible using conventional methods. Using this analysis framework, we identified a positive correlation with decisional confidence within the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), a region not previously associated with perceptual confidence, and one that was not visible with a conventional analysis of the fMRI data. Furthermore, a functional connectivity analysis revealed a confidence-level dependent link between the activity in the vmPFC and a region in the prefrontal cortex previously implicated in metacognitive evaluation. This suggests that signatures of confidence evolve early in the decision process and are subsequently passed onto to a separate network for metacognitive assessment (see Gherman and Philiastides, 2017).

Finally, we utilised the neural signatures of learning and confidence we uncovered above to develop a brain-computer-interface (BCI) system to inform and ultimate influence behaviour in a number of high throughput tasks. For example, we looked at pilot induced oscillations (PIOs) that are potentially catastrophic events that occur during flight when pilots attempt to control an aircraft close to a performance or physical boundary. PIO-like behavior is typically observed in boundary avoidance tasks (BAT), which simulate tight performance or physical boundaries and induce high cognitive workload. Our previous research linked the occurrence of PIO-like behavior to network level activity in the brain, where higher states of arousal reduce the flexibility of decision making networks such that less environmental information was incorporated to dynamically adjust action. This led us to hypothesize that down regulating arousal via closed-loop audio feedback of a user state could improve piloting performance by enabling learning of environmental contingencies and thereby increased decision flexibility. 

We implemented a hybrid brain computer interface (hBCI) to dynamically provide feedback to a &amp;quot;pilot&amp;quot; that facilitates their ability to reduce their state of arousal. We conduct a systematic comparison relative to control and sham conditions and test to see if this feedback increases the time a &amp;quot;pilot&amp;quot; can fly before a catastrophic PIO. We find that hBCI feedback, which includes central nervous system components consistent with theta activity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), enables prolonged flight relative to closed-loop control and sham feedback. We also find that this feedback induces changes in pupil diameter, which are absent in openloop conditions and closed-loop conditions when feedback is not veridical. Pupil diameter has been reported as a surrogate measure of activity in the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) system, which is also linked to a circuit that includes the ACC. We conclude that the feedback we induce with our hBCI provides preliminary evidence that self-regulation of LC-NE/ACC is possible and can be used to dynamically increase decision flexibility when under high cognitive workload (see Saproo et al., 2016).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our general research approach (simultaneous EEG-fMRI and corresponding analysis methods) as well as our scientific findings open up new avenues for the investigation of the neural systems underlying decision making in humans. Crucially, our findings have the potential to further our understanding of how everyday responses to new information can affect our capacity to make optimal decisions, as well as facilitate the study of how mental disorders - such as chronic stress, obsessive-compulsive-disorder, post-traumatic disorder and depression - affect learning and strategic planning. Correspondingly, our work can lead to the development of new methods for identifying diagnostic and prognostic indicators of cognitive deficits in disease, as well as more directed behavioural and pharmacological treatments. It is also likely that our results can have significant impact on how artificial neural networks are trained and adapted to learn to deal with an ever-increasing number of online &amp;quot;big data&amp;quot; applications. Correspondingly, our ability to integrate neural signatures of human cognition into the development of brain-computer interfaces promises to be a valuable tool for monitoring and ultimately augmenting human performance during tasks requiring high throughput of information and high levels of cognitive load.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5524FB2D-F5E1-4487-ABD1-78C2EBFE4101</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d9a23625da86.20254393</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology,Security and Diplomacy,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Summer School on Brain Imaging</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EE46F452-E532-4A46-8CF1-AF3DC9D11408</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We have been developing an international summer school on advanced brain imaging methods that will run on a yearly basis at the Centre for Cognitive Neuroimaging at the University Glasgow starting in 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d99088cd4972.36579777</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Chair of the IEEE Brain Initiative</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>19A06F03-AA8D-4C87-8312-80F668EB1CD7</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58bd9d96a6eb85.68549514</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://brain.ieee.org</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Combined measurements of electroencephalographic (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 25 healthy participants performing two different tasks designed to probe the neural correlates of perceptual learning and the role of confidence during perceptual decisions.</gtr:description><gtr:id>F26E5E7E-5036-42BA-9ED7-21D5B1B362F9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Combined EEG and fMRI measurements offer an opportunity to gain important new insights into human brain function that cannot be obtained using either modality alone (e.g. revealing latent brain states). Our ESRC funded work clearly demonstrated this in the context of studying perceptual learning and confidence during perceptual decisions (publications in preparation). Importantly, collecting this database allowed us to develop novel techniques to analyse the acquired data in way that supersedes what is currently considered common analysis practice in the human neuroimaging literature. We plan to make the database and our analysis tools fully available upon completion of the project and submission of all relevant work for publication.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c947a129e984.36894836</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Combined EEG/fMRI datasets - Confidence &amp; Learning</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2017</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>We developed a multivariate single-trial analysis framework for integrating simultaneously acquired EEG and whole-brain fMRI data.
