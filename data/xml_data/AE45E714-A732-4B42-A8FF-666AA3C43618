The proposed project aims to determine whether individuals carrying the MTHFR 677C to T mutation have different patterns of DNA methylation and uracil misincorporation (a form of DNA damage) in the colon compared with those who do not carry the mutation. An intervention study will then be carried out in healthy volunteers to determine whether increasing folate intakes (400 micrograms/d for 3 months) can alter DNA methylation and uracil misincorporation in the colon and whether this response differs according to MTHFR 677C to T genotype. Subjects for the intervention study will be recruited from the Department of Colorectal Surgery, King&amp;iquest;s College Hospital NHS Trust, London. The DNA methylation analyses will be undertaken at King&amp;iquest;s College London and LGC Ltd. The proposed research programme will exploit genomic approaches to assess the role of diet in the development of colorectal cancer, which places a high burden on healthcare resources in the UK. The results from this project will be relevant to both public health and consumer interests, particularly in view of the proposed folic acid fortification programme in the UK.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Observational studies suggest that a low dietary folate intake increases colorectal cancer risk while a common polymorphism in the key folate enzyme 5, 10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR 677C to T) decreases risk. Folate is required for transferring one carbon units in the de novo synthesis of purines and pyrimidines and DNA methylation. MTHFR catalyses the reduction of 5, 10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate. Low levels of 5, 10- methylenetetrahydrofolate results in decreased synthesis of thymidine and increased uracil misincorporation into DNA, which can result in DNA strand breaks and chromosomal damage. Low levels of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, the methyl donor for the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine in the methylation cycle, may disrupt normal patterns of DNA methylation, an epigenetic event that is involved in regulating gene expression. The MTHFR 677 C to T mutation results in a thermolabile enzyme with decreased activity and is a well established genetic determinant of hyperhomocysteinemia. Observational studies have reported that individuals homozygous for the mutation (TT) have decreased global DNA methylation in leucocytes, with the interaction dependent on folate status. However, the MTHFR 677C to T mutation appears to protect against colorectal cancer when folate status is adequate. It has been hypothesised that in the absence of low folate status the mutation does not compromise DNA methylation but increases DNA stability by sequestering 5, 10-methylenetetrahydrofolate for thymidine synthesis, leading to more efficient DNA synthesis and a decrease in uracil misincorporation into DNA. To date there have been no studies to address this hypothesis in the colon of healthy volunteers. The aim of the proposed project is to assess the influence of the MTHFR 677C to T mutation on DNA methylation patterns and uracil misincorporation in the colon of subjects without colorectal neoplasia and to determine whether increasing folate status can influence these parameters according to MTHFR 677 C to T genotype. Specific aims. 1. To determine whether the MTHFR 677C to T mutation is associated with DNA methylation and uracil misincorporation in the colon of healthy volunteers. 2. To determine whether increasing folate intake in healthy individuals can modify DNA methylation and uracil misincorporation in the colon and whether the response differs according to MTHFR 677C to T genotype. 3. To determine whether changes in CpG island methylation of specific genes are associated with corresponding changes in gene expression and whether the MTHFR 677C to T mutation influences the expression of folate-related genes.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-06-18</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-06-19</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>263752</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>05BD0CD6-F0A9-456E-9D4C-EDD2729A5016</gtr:id><gtr:title>The association between MTHFR 677C&amp;gt;T genotype and folate status and genomic and gene-specific DNA methylation in the colon of individuals without colorectal neoplasia.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The American journal of clinical nutrition</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/cce71c3565df505a86ca4c0d0e52cc7c"><gtr:id>cce71c3565df505a86ca4c0d0e52cc7c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hanks J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0002-9165</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>546cb55087d6d1.38378697</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/D523178/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
