Unusually the study is reflexive, near-ethnographic, and will measure the impact of policy transition as it happens. This application is rare if not unique in the archaeological heritage field. \n\nPlanning reform presents a timely opportunity to assess and critique the impact of policy shift on both immediate potential for public participation and community engagement and longer-term research and amenity outcomes. How will the new Planning Policy Statement 5 (PPS5) change the way we think about and practise archaeology within the planning system, and how will the period of transition influence professional archaeology and public involvement? \n\nOur partnership is between an academic department (York: Schofield) and the UK's principal non-governmental organisation representing the archaeological community (Council for British Archaeology: Chitty). Schofield was appointed to the department at York in July 2010 after 21 years with English Heritage. Chitty has worked in public sector archaeology, for English Heritage and as an archaeological consultant, for 35 years. The project also engages the experience of key organisations including the Institute for Archaeologists (IfA), English Heritage and the Association of Local Government Archaeological Officers (ALGAO), all of which have confirmed their involvement with the research.\n\nThe aims of the study are to assess, over the course of a three-year period, the impact of innovative planning policy and heritage concepts in development-led archaeology. Specifically: 1) How is policy shift and transition accommodated within the planning sector, and how effective are government and NGOs at leading or enabling the transition? How different is a system that is focused on a value-based principle of protecting cultural 'significance' and 'archaeological interest', as a primary objective of the planning system? 2) Can the introduction of PPS5 contribute public goods in terms of immediate opportunities for public participation and community engagement and also longer-term research and amenity outcomes? 3) Can the analysis of process and evolving practice as it happens (in real time) provide lessons for the conduct of and response to policy shift in the future? 4) How should we measure the impact of PPS5 on archaeological heritage management? Is it through development-led opportunities for public engagement in archaeological practice; is it through the production and public presentation of archaeological data; or is it in the evolution of working practices?\n\nIn addition to public and academic impacts, the research will have relevance across the heritage sector, in developing good practice for operational requirements during periods of policy transition. The project sees the collaboration and partnership of two leading proponents of public engagement within archaeological heritage, both with extensive sector experience, and academic profile. The partnership will exploit this common ground, supported by extended partnership of relevant bodies in a steering group including IfA, English Heritage and ALGAO. \n\nThe project will identify case studies that exemplify the maximisation of opportunity for short-term public participation and longer-term amenity outcomes. The recognition, analysis and promotion of good practice will generate further opportunity, notably through publications and professional outreach. PPS5 provides significant new opportunity for university-based researchers, notably with its emphasis on the promotion of 'understanding'. The study promotes an innovative approach to critically examining policy transition, being reflexive, near-ethnographic, and measuring the impact of policy transition as it happens.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Impacts for the professional heritage sector\nThe research will have relevance across the heritage sector, in terms of documenting operational and good practice requirements during periods of policy transition. The project sees the collaboration and partnership of\ntwo leading proponents of public engagement within archaeological heritage, both with extensive sector experience, and academic profile. The partnership will exploit this common ground in an extended partnership of relevant bodies and collaborators (IfA, FAME, English\nHeritage and ALGAO) as part of the review of implementation; the wider collaboration will itself have an impact in terms of closer partnership working, mutual understanding and shared communication.\n\nImpacts for public and community interests \nThe project will produce case studies, and identify good practice, that exemplify the maximisation of opportunity for short-term public participation and longer-term amenity outcomes. The recognition, analysis and promotion of good practice will generate further opportunity, notably through publications and professional outreach. The concept of public availability of knowledge and understanding gained through archaeological investigation as an objective of the land use planning process is entirely new, and an important outcome of the research will be a framework for measuring that impact, qualitatively as well as quantitatively.\n\nImpacts for academic partnership \nPPS5 provides significant new opportunity for university-based researchers, notably with its emphasis on the promotion of 'understanding'. The study also promotes an innovative approach to critically examining policy transition, being reflexive and near-ethnographic, measuring the impact of policy transition live, as it\nhappens. This application is rare if not unique in the archaeological heritage field. \n\nImpact for integration of cross-sector interests \nWe envisage there being a dynamic role for the researcher in both observing and facilitating debate and articulation of concerns, opinion and experience over the initial three years of policy implementation. This will result in an important area of reporting of outcomes from\nearly adoption, from which others in the sector can learn and which will itself stimulate new research questions. This is a generational change in public policy for the heritage, and the research collaboration will add particular impact through exploring opportunity for reintegration of academic research interests and public interest in development-led archaeological practices.\n\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>54916</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I024763/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
