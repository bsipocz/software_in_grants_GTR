Globally, 350m people need care and over 100m have dementia. The numbers are growing. 

Reminiscence - including life story discussion - is a key technique to help protect precious memories. It gives carers and family a meaningful way to engage with their loved one. Old photos are an essential element but carers rarely know who the people in the photos are, or the family stories attached to them. Written notes can help but many people with dementia can no longer read. And dementia sufferers may destroy unadapted products however precious they are - &amp;quot;&amp;quot;fiddling&amp;quot;&amp;quot; is a part of the disease for many. The net result is a loss of connection to the past, to one's family and to one's self.

Currently every approach to reminiscence uses just one stimulus ? sight. But we all know the joy of hearing family members? voices; the uplifting power of hearing a beloved grandchild, child or spouse. And these voices are so rarely present for those in care. Family visits once a week, for the lucky ones. And when spouses pass away, their voices go with them.

The ?Re-Mind? talking photo album is conceived by and for older people and those with dementia, their families and their carers. Each photo will be accompanied by voiceover from loved ones, telling the story of that photo. The voices in their own right will bring joy. By identifying the people, places and stories in the photo, the voiceover will help with both reminiscence and to sustain vital memories. Carers can use the resulting family history as a springboard for deeper and more meaningful conversations. And with the voiceover, many older people can use the album without relying on carer support.

In research, the concept has met with excitement amongst professional and family carers alike. This is not just a gap in the market, it is a whole new tool for delivering person-centred, joyful care.
