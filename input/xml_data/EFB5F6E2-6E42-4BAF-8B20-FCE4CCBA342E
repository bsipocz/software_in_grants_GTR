1688-1789.</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Fellowship</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/K010654/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>The project will examine, from a historical point of view, a number of key concepts and issues, which are particularly relevant to current debates, and which concern the broad question of the efficiency of fiscal systems and their political, economic and social impact. The project will explore this topic by setting it in Early Modern Europe, in the century that runs from the Glorious Revolution of 1688 to the French Revolution of 1789. This period constitutes a fantastic laboratory of past experiences for assessing the ways in which fiscal issues put the very fabric of societies under stress, causing crises and fostering change in Europe.&lt;br />&lt;br />This comparative project, which will draw on new archival research and secondary material, will lead to significant academic outputs, including a comprehensive and yet accessible monograph on the fiscal origins of the French Revolution, as well as networking activities with international specialists. Fiscal history has never been more relevant than today, and the public awareness raised by the crash of 2008-09 provides the perfect platform to make the subject better known and inform current debates. A series of public lectures will be organised and accessible through a dedicated website.. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The field and scope of the research proposed is very complex and accessible only to a small group of specialists. The current financial crisis offers a timely opportunity for historical finance to have a real impact in increasing public awareness about the relationship between financial crises and the evolution of economic, social and political systems. The impact activities will aim at disseminating and making relevant and accessible to the general public the scholarly questions, interpretations and findings of the research. For instance, it seems important to recognise that if financial crises can be very damaging to individuals or group of individuals, adequate solutions proposed to solve complex problems and methods for reaching a consensus on very divisive issues can help building a more stable and a fairer society. With these aims, historical finance has the power to influence and shape public policies and contribute to a better understanding of a number of key societal questions. In particular the project can be useful to the general public in showing how much the transition to the Modern World and the ascendancy of Britain relied on the ability of the various polities to provide innovative and sustainable political and fiscal solutions to overcome structural problems.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>194372</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University Hospitals in Paris</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>France, French Republic</gtr:country><gtr:description>Conclusion to international conference on 'Mirabeau, Cosmopolitan Culture, Political Economy and Society in 18th century France'</gtr:description><gtr:id>4404ADAF-3948-43AE-B9E9-F7C174D7CB95</gtr:id><gtr:impact>N/A</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5638c1d298b4b1.50209970-2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Organisation of the conference</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>I was invited to give the conclusions of major 2-day international conference entitled 'Mirabeau: Culture cosmopolite, &amp;eacute;conomie politique et soci&amp;eacute;t&amp;eacute; au XVIIIe si&amp;egrave;cle.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Histoire &amp; Mesure</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>France, French Republic</gtr:country><gtr:description>Organisation of international workshop on 'The Excesses of the State: Administrative control or political transparency? 17th -19th century Europe'</gtr:description><gtr:id>BD2B6028-BCA5-4A1B-A317-8B169AA0E456</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The speakers met in April 2014 and the papers will be submitted for publication by December 2014.

Four key areas have been explored.

1. Methodology. One key objective of the research was to provide a credible and continuous series of budgetary statistics charting the evolution of French finances between 1662 and 1788. The purpose of macro fiscal data, which was either unavailable or incomplete, was to allow both long- and short-term analysis of French fiscal structures, as well as comparisons with other polities during the period.
The main findings are as follows:
- France remained the foremost fiscal power throughout the period, although its capacity to tax national wealth was inferior to Britain's and Holland's but, still, greater than all other European states, either in real or absolute terms.
- In wartime, the French budget did not show a correlation between the level of taxation and expenditure; this was especially true when war broke out
- Throughout the period, France funded its war effort essentially by loans and credit
- While Britain increased taxes as soon as war started and reduced the fiscal burden when peace resumed, France raised its taxes at the end of the war and they remained subsequently at a high level during peacetime; this model can be explained by factors which are psychological (confidence in the sheer wealth and power of France), objective (fiscal inequality) and political (war determined policy and not fiscal capacity).
- The fiscal capacity of France increased over the period of study, especially in the years 1740-1770; in 1789, fiscal revenue was greater than Louis XIV's during his reign; at the same time, however, and against current views, the cumulative burdens of war on the eve of the French revolution, although very substantial, were not as severe as they had been in the two previous reigns. 
- The financial capacity of France decreased between 1688 and 1789, in particular from the mid-1750s onwards when Britain was able to raise more money than France through cheaper loans, and was de facto the foremost financial power. 

These key findings are crucial for two reasons. 1. The past and most recent literature on French fiscal history has failed to develop a quantitative approach. 2. Analysis of quantitative data helps assess government responses to external shocks and allows comparison of policies across Europe during the period.

2. Taxation. Another key objective of the project was to examine the role of fiscal privileges in the fall of the Old Regime in France. While historians agree that the French monarchy tried to tax privileged groups and managed to increase their contribution, the question of the actual level of taxes they paid as a portion of their wealth, and with comparison to the ordinary taxpayer, has remained uncertain and left many questions unanswered about the origins of fiscal crises and government policy. The research has offered an opportunity to identify new primary sources and provide accurate figures about the amount of taxes that the nobility and the clergy should have paid in a fairer fiscal system. This new knowledge is crucial to help reconsideration of the impact of tax inequality on the efficiency of fiscal systems, and the linkages with the fundamental issue of credit.

3. Credit. The failure of the French monarchy to set up a cheap system of credit to fund its expenditure, including the establishment of a bank, has been regarded as a key factor in the recurrence of fiscal crises. The research has focused considerable attention on the problems of war funding, in particular under Louis XIV, partly because a substantial body of primary sources still exist for this period, and partly because this reign remained the model for his successors until the mid-1750s. 
The research has successfully reconstituted the structures of the credit system and the financial market in the last 20 years of Louis XIV's reign and its impact during the Regency. Special attention has been devoted to the 'Caisse des emprunts' as the French version of a bank, the role of financiers, the profile of the creditors and their concerns. Archival findings have made it possible to quantify the profits of the financiers during the Nine Year's War and also to show that the government imposed a 50% windfall tax on the benefits they earned. 
The research has devoted considerable attention to monetary policy, in particular to the problem of coinage in wartime and the methods used to inject fiat money (credit) into the fiscal system. Analysis of the first issue of paper money (1701-1712) has revealed that the experience, despite its shortcomings, was initially a success which helped the monarchy pursue the war effort after the defeat at Blenheim. Building upon these findings, the research can better document and explain the ways in which money shortages and fiscal inequality contributed to fiscal crises, and show the extent to which the problem of credit remained a critical aspect of French fiscal history and the one of the main areas of debates about the reform of the financial system throughout the period. 

4. Accounting. Some French specialists have argued that poor accounting techniques and lack of efficient administrative controls of accountants were largely responsible for French fiscal crises. The research project has brought to lightnew documents, and this on three counts. 1. A unique correspondence between one of the main French tax receivers and his clerk, with relevant accounts, has been identified. 2. A set of as as yet undiscovered budgetary documents of an exceptional nature and produced by the French government between 1785 and 1791, and including fiscal data for 22 European states at the time, has been digitised and are available on a website attached to the research project. 3. Calonne's fiscal report presented to Louis XVI in 1786, which set France on a revolutionary course, has been identified. 
These exceptional primary sources could not be analysed in full in the course of the research project but will form the basis for future work to look afresh at the debates concerning budget figures, budgetary techniques, fiscal planning and administrative control.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>1. The findings have been published in journal articles and special issues of academic journals, in the published proceedings of the workshop and conference I organised. Some of the outcomes are in press and will appear in 2017.
The findings will form the backbone of the planned monograph on the fiscal origins of the French Revolution. Documents discovered in the course of the project will also lead to additional publications in the near future.

2. In addition to the findings, the activities associated with the grants (public lectures, digitisation of documents) are accessible to the public via a special website. The website documents three three main topics: The birth of fiscal transparency; Finance and morality, and War and the economy. These themes have a strong European comparative agenda and have brought together experts from across Europe.

3. The research project has also generated new collaborations with academics from several countries on a variety of relevant topics.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>DACA8EA4-A85E-4AA0-8BAC-5B7376CA5654</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dfe139baa6c2.20066079</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>As part of my grant application and case for impact I proposed to create a website that would make my research more widely available and also the electronic publication of a set of exceptional fiscal documents about 26 states on the eve of the French Revolution, documents which were unknown and are almost impossible to consult due to their size.
