More specifically, this project seeks to explore if and how women's social status affects the ability of women?s organization to contribute to peace-building processes and to discover if and how external actors, such as the UN, incorporate women's organisations in the peace-building process.&amp;nbsp; Finally, the project explores the process of local networks' development and if this is affected positively where women?s status is higher.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project uses semi-structured interviews in Liberia to extract relevant information from both representatives from women's organisation as well as external participants in peacebuilding, such as UN officials and Non-governmental organisations, to explore patterns of interaction in between local women's organisations and the UN.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p>

&lt;p>The interviews start from a standard script aimed at providing answers to the core questions regarding women's organisations and peacebuilding. The original script will allow uniformity across the selected sample, while the flexible nature of semi-structured interviews will still leave room to adjust the questions to the interviewee(s). Thus, it is possible to identify actual experiences of engagement between women's organisations, UN officials and other external actors.&lt;br />&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>35000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Folke Bernadotte Academy</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Sweden, Kingdom of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Gender and peacekeeping working group</gtr:description><gtr:id>671081C8-9A95-45DC-BF8E-1C0006ACEA4F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Olsson, Louise and Gizelis, Theodora-Ismene (2014) 'Advancing Gender and Peacekeeping Research.'

International Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) often tend to ignore the role of local CSOs and especially women organisations in peacebuilding.



Yet, the research project has revealed and documented:

o Significant variations in local capacity: Some of the oldest and most resilient women's organisations are present in regions where women traditionally have had higher status relative to the men as well as a history of forming loose social associations. 

o Significant variation in civil society: Areas where women's organisations form more dense networks also tend to have a more vibrant civil society, creating feedback effects and better prospects for peacebuilding projects. 

o Limited local-external interaction: UN and International NGOs are more active in areas where local society is more vibrant and organised, yet they do not fully engage with local actors, especially women's organisations. Interactions between UN bodies and women's organisations are quite limited in scope and time-frame, and are mostly characterised by local organisations developing dependency of funding by external donors. 

o Limited interaction between the UN missions and women's organisations leads to mistrust from both sides, weakening the effect of peacebuilding policies and negative implications to post-conflict reconstruction.



The research also suggests:

o Alternative criteria to assess women's organizations that are active in post-conflict environments.

o Best practices that can be expanded and replicated in other contexts beyond Liberia.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The project might be of interest among practitioners and policymakers who work in peacebuilding, security and post-conflict reconstruction.
