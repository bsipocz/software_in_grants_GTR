Despite effective treatments like surgery and radiotherapy, prostate cancer can return. When this happens treatment with hormones and chemotherapy are traditionally used to control cancer. Chemotherapy is often used for patients who do not respond to hormonal treatment any longer. Chemotherapy however can cause severe side effects and does not provide a cure. It is obvious that better treatments are needed. 

Using the bodies own immune system to treat cancer is an interesting option. We and other researchers have found a particular protein on cancer cells, which can activate a patients own immune cells via a receptor called NKG2D in order to kill cancer cells but not healthy cells. We have also seen that cancer patients receiving hormone treatment or chemotherapy for prostate cancer show lower levels of this receptor on their immune cells. However, after treatment with zoledronate, a drug already commonly used to treat cancer spread to bones, an improvement in this receptor level can be seen. These results suggest that perhaps we can influence the interaction between cancer and immune cells via this receptor. 

Our aim is to investigate this NKG2D receptor in patients with prostate cancer. We will investigate whether this receptor and the way it works varies in patients with low grade (less aggressive) and high grade (more aggressive) prostate cancer. In addition to this we will look at the influence of various prostate cancer treatments (chemotherapy and hormone treatment) on this receptor. Finally we will investigate whether we can improve the function of the immune system in response to the NKG2D receptor. 

For this research project we will use prostate cancer tissue samples stored in the Prostate Cancer Tissue Bank at King's College London. We will also use blood samples from patients with prostate cancer undergoing treatment with hormone or chemotherapy. Finally we will use cancer cells in the laboratory to carry out some of our experiments. The research will be carried out in Professor Hayday's laboratory on the Guy's Campus of King's College London. 
Ultimately our results will increase our understanding of prostate cancer and the immune system and could lead to a new form of prostate cancer immune therapy. New treatments with fewer side effects are needed for thousands of men diagnosed with prostate cancer every year. Therefore this research project will be an important contribution.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Introduction 
Treatment of advanced prostate cancer with chemotherapy can be toxic in a generally elderly population. Immunotherapy, with potentially fewer side effects has recently gained renewed interest. Our laboratory has investigated the receptor NKG2D on NK cells and gamma delta T cells. This receptor can be activated by cells expressing NKG2D ligands, found on prostate cancer cells but only in limited amounts on healthy cells. We have shown that patients with prostate cancer receiving concomitant therapies display a significant impairment in the NKG2D pathway, although this potentially can be boosted, suggesting therapeutic application.
Aim and objectives 
This project will explore the NKG2D pathway as part of the lymphoid stress surveillance in prostate cancer. The following questions will be addressed: 1) Is there evidence that the NKG2D pathway varies with tumour stage in patients with prostate cancer? 2) Is there evidence that the NKG2D pathway varies with concomitant therapy in patients with prostate cancer and is this correlated with altered killing potential? 
3) Are we able to influence to variability of PBMC responses to NKG2D ligand + targets?
Methods 
Experimental set up includes gene expression analysis on prostate cancer tissue examining components of the NKG2D axis. Patient blood samples to monitor the NKG2D pathway during various therapies. Flow cytometry for phenotypical and functional analysis. Co-culture experiments with peripheral blood mononuclear cells and NKG2D ligand + cell lines will be used in order to optimise the NKG2D pathway. 
Scientific and medical opportunities 
Exploration of the NKG2D-ligand interaction under various tumour and host conditions will help our understanding of this axis as a target for immune therapy, which ultimately could benefit patients.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Patients
The aim of this project is to increase our understanding of the influences of tumour stage and concomitant anti-cancer therapies on the immune system, with the ultimate goal to develop more effective immunotherapy for patients with prostate cancer. Immunotherapy can either be administered as a single treatment or in combination with currently existing prostate cancer treatments. Patients will eventually benefit from this research as new treatments can lead to improved survival and control of cancer related symptoms. Immunotherapy can also have a more tolerable side effect profile, which can improve patient's quality of life and overall wellbeing. 
 
Health service
Improvements in prostate cancer treatment with advantageous side effect profiles can lead to a reduction in hospital admissions for management of poorly controlled cancer symptoms or treatment related side effects. This can benefit the national health service through reduction in costs attached to hospital in-patient admissions. 

Society/employers
As a result of more effective prostate cancer treatment, symptoms of advanced prostate cancer could be reduced and better controlled. In addition to this, a beneficial safety profile could lead to more patients being able to continue their usual daily activities and possibly employment, which will not only benefit themselves in terms of financial and psychological impact, but also government and society as a whole trough tax revenues. 

Timelines
Outcomes of this project can possibly have a clinical impact for prostate cancer patients within the next 5 years. Aminobisphosphonates as an immunomodulatory therapy are already used in clinical trials for various malignancies and currently licensed for treatment of cancer related bone disease. Our project will focus on optimising the timing of immunotherapy by investigating changes in immune surveillance via the NKG2D axis and examining the influence of concomitant cancer therapies. Aminobisphosphonates will be used in order to influence the variability of immuneresponses and additional agents will be used such as cytokines, some of which are also already used in clinical practise. Considering current ongoing research and the potential useful properties of the agents to be investigated, some of which are already licensed, timely impact on patient care is realistic within the 5 year timeframe.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>240176</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs><gtr:productOutput><gtr:clinicalTrial>true</gtr:clinicalTrial><gtr:description>The product under investigation (Interleukin-2) already has a license in malignant disease.
