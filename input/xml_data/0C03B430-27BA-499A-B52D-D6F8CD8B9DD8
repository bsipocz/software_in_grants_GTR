Through a study of material practices connected with Guant&amp;aacute;namo, the controversial U.S. military detention and interrogation facilities now in its eleventh year - including practices involving its objects and environments and their successive alterations, detention and interrogation practices, media practices such as photography and tours, and varied speech practices - this project documents the production of different ways that the site has been understood and represented.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Building on studies that focus on linguistic constructions of security, this project explores how materialities - practices involving bodies, objects and spaces that shape our way of being and knowing in the world - played a constitutive role in the production of the discourse about Guant&amp;aacute;namo and therefore of the wider Global War on Terror. U.S. administrations used these practices to produce and reinforce political positions and so construct ?common sense? concerning the nature of security threats, on the one hand, and what constitutes legal and humane treatment, on the other. Those opposed to Guant&amp;aacute;namo - including those detained inside as well as those protesting outside ? were inevitably involved in counter-constructions, some of them very imaginative, and frequently disturbing.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>78410</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Practitioners working in NGOs and as independent investigators, especially photojournalists and photographers have read and referenced my research on Guantanamo in order to inform their practice.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>B1188D3D-D9F1-4D3E-9D72-D514A650A695</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56cb0ee18e9241.64405827</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The first main contribution of this research is promoting greater understandings of the causes and consequences of the Global War on Terror. Uniquely, this project approached Guantanamo through the lens of the everyday practices at the site and in resistance to it. To understand the different arguments for and against the war and Bush Administration policies, this project charted the transformations of laws and norms governing detention and interrogation (including the codification of indefinite detention without trial, the militarization of counterterrorism, and the open justification of torture) to make an argument that officials used the site as a highly and selectively visible spectacle to generate support for these transformations. Those opposed to Guantanamo - including those detained inside as well as those protesting outside - were inevitably involved in counter-constructions concerning the nature of security threats, on the one hand, and what constitutes legal and humane treatment, on the other.

The second main contribution of this work is to current cutting-edge debates within critical security studies on material and visual practices within security discourses, an area of research that has prompted recent major conferences in the US and the UK. In particular, this work drives an argument for broadening IR to consider insights from visual culture and material culture studies. 

The third main contribution to this research is in its significance in broadening our understanding of where (in)security is located as exemplified in the article, 'Interrogating 24' (NPS, 2009). IR as a discipline increasingly recognizes the relevance of popular culture ('high' and 'low') in shaping understandings of politics and therefore policies. As part of this move, this work has contributed to extending our understanding of the concept of intertextuality and frames through, for example, research on the popular television show 24 or the photographs circulated of Guantanamo.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This work is of interest to policy-makers, journalists and activists interested in understanding the origins of political controversies and issue framing.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>FE029292-D43F-4DE6-81A5-303C2D999A49</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-3088662329.212448b2f375d4</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/I038241/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F7EEE6CD-E283-4BAB-BA5E-70B4B0F1F1A6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
