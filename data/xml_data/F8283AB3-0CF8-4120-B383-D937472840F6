This is also true for mathematicians, although in mathematics the lists are usually infinite. When dealing with an infinite list or family of objects, you first need to come up with a way to label them: for example, do you label the objects by natural numbers 1,2,3,...(indices) or by real numbers (parameters)? Labelling by real numbers (or by k-tuples of real numbers) means that you parameterise the objects in the family by points on the real line or in k-dimensional space. Obviously, as with any list, you need to make sure that you haven't missed anything or didn't count something twice. For that reason, quite often the space of parameters is more complicated than just a real line or space, and it is not always easy to get it right.
 
For example, look at all circles of radius 1 in the plane. Each circle is uniquely described by giving its centre, i.e. the whole family is parameterised by points of the plane. If instead we look at the family of all lines in the plane, then a parameterisation is less obvious; in this case, the space of parameters has a shape of the Mobius band. In both cases the parameterisation on a small scale looks similar, but globally there is a significant difference: the plane surface has two sides while the Mobius band has only one.

It is usually difficult to parameterise an infinite family of objects in an orderly fashion by the points of some nice, smooth space, so whenever that happens it makes mathematicians very happy. This project will look into particular instances of a recently emerged pattern when the objects which look completely unrelated at first, turn out to admit nice parameterisation by the same space. For instance, solutions of some complicated nonlinear differential equations governing water waves turn out to correspond to solutions of some algebraic equations, which in their turn correspond to the motion of certain interacting particles. Uncovering deep underlying reasons and mechanisms for such correspondences is very important, because we can then hope to use them in other situations in order to solve otherwise inaccessible problems. And that's exactly what the proposed project will try to achieve.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Fundamental research in mathematics has a lasting effect on other natural sciences. It also underpins a wide range of activities that benefit society, including engineering, economics and computer science. 
The proposed research due to its highly inter-disciplinary nature is expected to have a wide resonance in the UK and internationally. The UK is one of the world leaders in the integrable systems research. We propose to bring in more recent algebraic methods and techniques which will considerably modernize this area, strengthening the UK's leadership. The UK is also a world leader in the area of Cherednik algebras and related representation theory and combinatorics. Our research will connect this area to the study of moduli spaces of solutions to various nonlinear integrable equations. This will lead to new questions and insights in the area of Cherednik algebras, bridging together two areas of the UK's strength. The proposed work is expected to clarify the connection between Gaudin model and differential operators with special monodromy properties, which is closely related to the geometric Langlands program, a very important topic in modern mathematics. An active research in that area is currently being undertaken in the US, Russia and France. There is a growing interest and involvement in that area in the UK, so our ambition is to make the UK more visible in that rapidly growing area. This will have a beneficial impact on the landscape of mathematics in the UK. Exchange visits supported by the project will enhance existing and promote new international collaboration in mathematics. The proposal asks for funds to support for a two-day workshop at the University of Leeds. This workshop will bring together leading experts in different areas, aiming at exchange of ideas and exploring opportunities for international collaboration.

A distinctive benefit to the University of Leeds is due to the fact that the proposed programme bridges together the research areas of Algebra and Integrable Systems within the School, thus facilitating a fruitful interaction and exchange of ideas. The project will expose RA to not just one but quite a few active areas of research, providing an excellent opportunity for training and professional development and making the RA a valuable member of the academic community. The project managing aspect will also be crucial for the PI's career development. 

The proposed project will have a broad educational impact in the UK mathematical community. The framework and methods developed in our project will form a core material for a new graduate course on integrable systems and representation theory. The proposed research will also open up many directions for future study, thus creating a large pool of problems for postgraduate training and research.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-08-06</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-04-10</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>237156</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>1010</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>LMS Scheme 2</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-04-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>London Mathematical Society</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>21511</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>AFC36D7F-E233-4487-8D1A-48C3943C60BC</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dd6e1212a9c9.05526904</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Learned Society</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-04-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>1400</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>LMS Undergraduate Research Bursary</gtr:description><gtr:end>2015-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>London Mathematical Society</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>URB 15-81</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>FEE4E747-BBE5-40CD-A0B7-F07FADD8FF52</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dd6d182dcce8.56262671</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Learned Society</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-06-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We established new interesting links between algebraic objects such as quivers and their representations on one side, and certain equations in mathematical physics, describing certain non-linear evolutionary processes or integrable particle dynamics.

Broadly, the goal of the project was to find analogues of the plethora of the results around the Calogero--Moser correspondence for the more general case of a cyclic quiver. This has been largely successful. Some of the sub-goals may not have been fully achieved, sometimes due to natural risks associated with overly-ambitious proposals such as this, but also due to changes in the research landscape. We, however, explored some other related lines of research that we did not originally anticipate. 

Some of the key findings:

1. A new generalisation of the KP hierarchy of nonlinear evolutionary equations has been found. It is naturally related to the cyclic quiver and its representations, and has been linked to the Calogero--Moser system of highly-symmetric particles. As an unexpected by-product, we found a new spin generalisation of the Calogero-Moser system for the generalised symmetric group. By studying the multiplicative quiver varieties, a new generalisation of the Ruijsenaars--Schneider system of relativistic particles has been constructed. Some related differential and q-difference bispectral equations of Bessel type have been constructed and linked with nonlinear evolutionary equations and particle dynamics. (Objective 3) 

2. Moduli spaces of ideals of Cherednik algebra of the cyclic group were related to two types of differential equations with special monodromy properties. This generalised some of the results of similar kind known in the theory of the Gaudin model. As a by-product not anticipated originally, this led to a proof of a conjecture of Etingof and Rains (2010) about finite-gap operators with cyclic symmetry. (Objective 4)

3. Calogero--Moser spaces over curves have been canonically linked to global Cherednik algebras by PI and VR. A motivic decomposition of the Calogero--Moser spaces over curves has been obtained by PI jointly with G. Bellamy. (Objective 2) This led to a currently ongoing work of PI and G. Bellamy, aimed at understanding this decomposition to curves with cyclic symmetry.

4. The above line of research led to some further new developments, not anticipated initially. 

a) We found a conceptual construction of quantum Lax pairs for the systems of Calogero--Moser type from Dunkl operators. This proves the existence of Lax pairs and opens up a possibility for their explicit construction in the cases where numerous earlier efforts were unsuccessful.

b) We made some first steps towards understanding the Calogero--Moser correspondence in higher dimensions. In particular, the role of a special class of reflexive ideals of the n-th Weyl algebra and higher rank Cherednik algebra has been revealed. 

c) We found a hypergeometric analogue of Wilson's adelic Grassmannian. This leads to a far-reaching generalisation of the differential-differnce bispectral duality known in the theory of orthogonal polynomials.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our research opened up new avenues for investigation, and currently two PhD students are working on problems that originated or have been motivated by our work on this project.
