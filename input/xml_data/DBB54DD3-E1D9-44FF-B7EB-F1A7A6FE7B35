The most recent HMRC estimate of the tax gap places it in the region of &amp;pound;40 billion, which is about 8 per cent of total tax liability. Good tax administration is essential for reducing this gap. A reduction of the gap is also an HMRC Departmental Strategic Objective. Controlling the tax gap requires the implementation of an effective auditing strategy that is based on an understanding of the processes at work in the individual compliance decision.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>An under-researched area of tax administration is the optimal design of portfolios of enforcement measures, for existing models assume that the tax authority performs only one type of tax audit. In practice, enforcement measures vary according to their cost and effectiveness, and the way in which they are targeted. The analysis will centre on the strategic interaction between taxpayers and the tax authority - how taxpayers will respond to a given intervention, and, given that, how the tax authority should optimally design a portfolio of intervention types. It will accommodate taxpayers who are heterogeneous in income, risk preferences, and attitudes towards compliance.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Tax evasion is a worldwide phenomenon, and a significant issue in most developed economies, including the UK. The design of an effective policy to reduce the tax gap requires an understanding of the factors that affect compliance and the sophisticated design of enforcement policies. The proposed research advances knowledge in this area by contributing to the economic theory of tax compliance and thereby enhancing the quality of tax administration.

The economic literature has developed a range of equilibrium concepts for understanding the strategic interactions between actors. To date, however, some unrealistic assumptions of the standard model of tax evasion have prevented these techniques from being applied to the question of how a portfolio of audits and campaigns should be designed. Moreover, behavioural economics is providing a range of new insights to supplement traditional game theoretic approaches. The proposed research will provide a systematic study how taxpayers are expected to respond to a given intervention and, given that, how a tax authority should optimally design a portfolio of audits and campaigns. The research will explore these issues under the standard economic assumption of expected utility analysis as a benchmark, but will then seek to understand the implications of alternative approaches from behavioural economics.

The project will be beneficial to a range of academics. At its broadest, the beneficiaries will be the whole community of scholars who will benefit from our improved understanding of human behaviour. Also, in future, the agent-based techniques that form an element of this project will be used to study a wide range of problems in behavioural economics problems, including saving and pension decisions. Within the set of scholars interested in human behaviour, the project will be of especial benefit to current and future researchers working on the economics and psychology of tax compliance, who are identified in more detail in the section on Academic Beneficiaries. A central element of the proposed research is to allow for the insights of behavioural economics in the compliance decision. Therefore, the research will also benefit researchers working in the field of applied behavioural economics more generally, by illustrating the predictions of this approach within a new context. 

Outside of academia the research will be used by tax authorities internationally, and especially in the UK. For instance, HMRC are currently appraising an option to introduce a new 'light-touch' audit type. They are also seeking expert academic input to optimise the design of a relatively new area of enforcement: targeted campaigns. Having worked closely with HMRC in designing this proposal, it has been carefully tailored to address both of these current issues. As tax authorities are increasing benchmarking against each other internationally, other international tax authorities are carefully monitoring these issues in the UK. 

The computer simulation element of the proposal will produce programs available for users in tax authorities that will enable them to analyse a rich array of different policy scenarios. They will be able to utilise this tool to shed new light on questions relating to the strategic design of enforcement measures, and thereby to issues of internal resource allocation. New insight will be gained into current questions, such as to whether to introduce a new 'light-touch' audit type, and how best to design campaigns. 

Beyond the life of the project, utilising strong links with the Government Economic Service from my time as a civil servant, the research will benefit a wider group of users responsible for enforcement. These include the TV Licensing Authority, the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency, and the Department for Work and Pensions. New insights into the operations of these departments will help to develop models of internal resourcing and improve returns to enforcement activities.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>166096</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation to the ESRC/HMRC/HMT Tax Administration Research Centre Inaugural Conference</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2B33426B-680C-4D83-8C87-7DE8F5E11C84</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This talk was extremely helpful, as the audience were subject experts.

I am due next month to meet analysts in Risk and Intelligence Services (RIS) to discuss my findings, and how they can inform the design of these Schemes.

I have previously met with Kevin Fletcher (and team) of the Local Compliance Unit within HMRC concerning my work on optimal auditing when audits are imperfect at detecting non-compliance. HMRC are particularly interested in the findings of this study regarding the conditions under which light-touch auditing forms part of the optimal audit portfolio.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>88C76182-BD24-4BE6-8AAE-B17C7D60FF01</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>560a549d0eeb10.42657369</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>A key aspect of the grant has been to study the optimal design of schemes to recover tax revenue on offshore funds. Recent years have seen tax authority's worldwide running quasi-amnesty programs in which taxpayers affected by an information disclosure (e.g., by a whistle-blower) are invited to make a voluntary disclosure in return for a reduced fine. To do this I have developed a model of the strategic interaction between taxpayers and a tax authority when the tax authority has access to third-party information. Having characterised the optimal design I am then able to evaluate long-standing concerns regarding the use of such schemes, such as the possibility that offering lower fines gives taxpayers long-run incentives to invest offshore. 
A second strand of the grant has investigated how a resource-constrained tax authority should optimally trade-off between audit-effectiveness (or quality) and audit probability. Put simply, a tax authority can do many cheap (but potentially ineffective) audits, or fewer more robust audits. In particular, I have shown how the optimal effectiveness-probability trade-off varies with reported income: low reports should face a low probability of a highly-effective audit, whereas high reports should face a higher probability of a lower-effectiveness audit.
A final strand of the grant has focused on integrating concepts from psychology into the tax evasion decision. Here I have developed a framework for analysis that is much more general than that considered in the earlier literature. Contrary to my initial expectations, however, I find in this more general framework that the principal model employed in economic psychology - prospect theory - does not importantly improve the descriptive validity of the standard economic theory. Thus, I believe, researchers must think again about how prospect theory can be usefully applied to the study of tax compliance.
As a result of the grant I have formed new collaborations with Amedeo Piolatto of the University of Barcelona (with whom I co-authored one of the outputs), Matthew Gould (who acted as my postgraduate research fellow), Paul Webley (who acted as a mentor), and the Tax Administration Research Centre.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Beginning with academic routes, I believe there are important extensions of the work carried out on the grant to wider issues in the economics of crime and deterrence. For instance, I believe my study of optimal enforcement under third-party information and self-informing has extensible insights beyond tax compliance to crime in general. My work on prospect theory and tax evasion suggests the need for new thinking on the boundary of psychology and economics and offers some new routes for exploration.
Turning to non-academic routes, my work on the design of schemes to recover offshore funds will build into the design and appraisal of future such schemes by HMRC, the British tax authority. I also hope that my work will influence other tax authorities around the world - in particular the US tax authority. My work on the optimal trade-off between audit effectiveness and audit probability will also feed into reviews of how HMRC does its audit enforcement activities. As a former employee, I retain strong links within HMRC, and I am in regular communication with senior officials as part of my role for the Tax Administration Research Centre. I will use my contact with senior officials to ensure that the key messages from my research are heard and understood by practitioners.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>1FCE6E18-8DD1-430A-B8B4-C641F3C7DC8E</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54858ffaaaf9d9.42778146</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A542524F-6540-4832-8DD5-FD7A7586CA28</gtr:id><gtr:title>Voluntary Disclosure Schemes for Offshore Tax Evasion: An Analysis</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/62d588efdda898fe4ef8445383abbf1b"><gtr:id>62d588efdda898fe4ef8445383abbf1b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Matthew D Rablen</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56e0316422c7b9.38979142</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BF62DD35-C054-4770-B088-98425553DFD7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Prospect theory and tax evasion: A re-examination of the Yitzhaki puzzle</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ee6e05fff8c8f45c2c8bc36150583584"><gtr:id>ee6e05fff8c8f45c2c8bc36150583584</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Piolatto A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>54636159130a55.05734519</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>43190478-A379-4103-BCBB-ECC0ABD33133</gtr:id><gtr:title>Prospect theory and tax evasion: a reconsideration of the Yitzhaki puzzle</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Theory and Decision</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ee6e05fff8c8f45c2c8bc36150583584"><gtr:id>ee6e05fff8c8f45c2c8bc36150583584</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Piolatto A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5832c8c05f4668.39773289</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>55DB86D9-CAA6-4C54-AA3B-34A3FCF9D428</gtr:id><gtr:title>Prospect theory and tax evasion: a re-consideration of the Yitzhaki paradox</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ee6e05fff8c8f45c2c8bc36150583584"><gtr:id>ee6e05fff8c8f45c2c8bc36150583584</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Piolatto A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>546361eb6c4800.24056982</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>B91D1C57-E7C4-463C-BDB5-3F23AADE01FA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Prospect Theory and Tax Evasion: A Reconsideration of the Yitzhaki Puzzle</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>SSRN Electronic Journal</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ee6e05fff8c8f45c2c8bc36150583584"><gtr:id>ee6e05fff8c8f45c2c8bc36150583584</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Piolatto A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>54636264c4fce3.39844512</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/K001744/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
