Intrinsic in this definition is an interplay between geometric properties of the variety and algebraic properties of the defining equations, a classical and fundamental problem in algebraic geometry. The projects described in this proposal will provide a major step towards the understanding of this relationship. 

Hilbert realised that a powerful way of studying the defining equations of a variety is by considering the so-called higher syzygies. A first syzygy is a polynomial relations satisfied by the given equations. There are finitely many first syzygies that generate (allowing polynomial coefficients) all first syzygies of a given set of equations. Now one can continue by looking at the relations between the first syzygies, the so-called second syzygies, and so on. The Betti numbers record the number of ith syzygies of a certain degree needed to generate all syzygies. They carry a lot of information about the embedding of the variety. For example, given the equations vanishing on seven points in space, one can detect from their Betti numbers whether there exists a polynomial of degree 3 vanishing on all of them. 

Usually one studies algebraic varieties from the abstract point of view, admitting many different embeddings into space that correspond to so-called very ample divisors, certain formal sums of subvarieties of one less dimension. It is a fundamental question in algebraic geometry to study the relationship between geometric properties of these divisors and algebraic properties of the resulting embedding. An example of a geometric property would be in how many points the divisor intersects an arbitrary given curve, and an example of an algebraic property would be that all defining equations can be generated from equations of degree two. This proposal deals with investigating this relationship using methods of discrete geometry.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The primary impact of this project will be on further developing expertise in the UK in the field of algebraic geometry, tropical geometry, commutative algebra, and combinatorics. This will maintain and increase the world-leading role of UK researchers in these areas, which has been recognised in the past two international reviews of mathematics. 

This project addresses important unsolved problems about the structure of the defining ideals of algebraic varieties. It will use a completely new combinatorial approach to the study of such ideals for a special class of algebraic varieties, but will also have implications to ideals of more general algebraic varieties. This project will also have impact on researchers who need to find the defining equations of given ideals, in particular, in applied algebraic geometry. 

A key part of the proposed grant will be the training of a postdoctoral researcher (PDRA). Thus this project will have a direct impact on building the capacity of the UK in the mathematical sciences and in STEM fields more generally. Research in pure mathematics is of benefit to society more broadly. More generally, mathematics is fundamental to the UK economy as explained in a recent study by EPSRC. As well as these direct impacts, mathematical research activities by organisations and employees also has indirect and induced effects.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-26</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-27</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>101021</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>For Projects A and B, Adam Boocher and I have been working on a better understanding of cohomology vanishing of toric vector bundles, in order to apply this to understand the defining equations of toric varieties. We were able to reformulate the computation of such a cohomology group in terms of linear algebra, however, this problem is also difficult to solve. 

Moreover, in relation to project A2, Hendrik S&amp;uuml;ss and I have been studying stability conditions of Lazarsfeld-Mukai bundles and Tangent bundles to toric varieties. This is still ongoing work. 

For Project C, Josephine Yu and I were able to formulate a condition for projective normality of tropical divisors and show that it holds for tropical elliptic curves. 

In an additional project with Kevin Tucker, we compute singularities associated to seminormal affine toric rings that are defined through the Frobenius morphism, the so-called F-signature. We also study many related questions. 

Adam Boocher has also worked to understand the sequence deviations of graded algebras. Deviations are a sequence of integers that encode the complexity of a graded ring, and are still mysterious even in the simplest cases. In two papers, he and collaborators studied extremal properties of deviations and applied their study to the structure of Koszul homology, answering a question of Avramov. Previous results on related invariants were recovered in the process.

With Frank-Olaf Schreyer I co-organised a conference at ICMS on Minimal Free Resolutions, Betti numbers, and Combinatorics. The conference was a big success, it attracted more than 70 participants and inspired new research.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Further research in algebraic geometry, commutative algebra, and algebraic statistics.
