&lt;p>In this research integrator role we will function as a facilitator - a critical friend - of the successful research teams and DSTL in order to allow them, through their own impact plans and co-ordination with other research teams, to produce high quality and user-friendly research outputs and knowledge.

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>Ensure that the research projects maximise impact and uptake well beyond their funding period by building durable networks between the project researchers, policy communities and other project relevant stakeholders.&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Help foster and develop research impact communities between social (including arts and humanities) and natural/physical scientists within academia, business and industry, and policy; laying the foundations for future collaborations and continued synergies beyond the funded life of the projects.&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Ensure that our communication and engagement activities highlight the world class nature and importance of these projects and the role of ESRC, AHRC and DSTL.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/li>

&lt;/ul></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Impact is very much part of the overall &amp;quot;DNA&amp;quot; of this integrator programme of activity. Through the use of our CSIF methodology we will promote openness, sensitivity, readiness and responsiveness as a means of promoting impact and research take-up. This will not only be with the more immediate stakeholders within our pre-existing networks, but go beyond this looking to extend and construct networks within the horizons of the funded projects. 

For the research projects our team will:

- Ensure that areas of research overlap and commonalities are integrated to present a clear research platform to stakeholders.
- Extend their networks and maximise the potential for their projects impact through programme events and brown paper bag lunches that adopt a CSIF methodology.
- Provide a methodology that allows stakeholders to be active participants in the research process itself throughout all stages of the research.
- Provide a methodology that allows space for other cultural perspectives to feed into deliberations and discussions around how research can be used, helping to overcome the problem of blind-spots in the research process. 
- Design Qualtrics questionnaires to gather further impact data, whilst also providing a basis from which to make verified and quantifiable impact claims. 
- Ensure clear communication and visibility of the projects to specific stakeholders and the wider public through a variety of old and new media platforms.
- Contribute to the debate regarding how the Arts, Social Sciences and Hard Sciences can be integrated to produce state of the art research.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>120831</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Our role as the Research Integrator in the Science and Security programme was to work with the successful research teams and DSTL in order to allow them, through their own impact plans and co-ordination with other research teams, to produce high quality and user-friendly research outputs and knowledge. To ensure the co-production of outstanding research our integrator activities included: regular communications with, and site visits to, the research teams; programme meetings to understand and exploit synergies across the project teams; a project webpage (with embedded new media technologies); direct engagements with user communities - including workshops and meetings with government departments; and, the production of and ethics report.

Impact is occurring in the Science and Security programme well beyond the funding period as a result of the networks and synergies between projects created during the programme. For example, Science and Security events have continued in the post-project phase involving project members and policymaking communities and many project have continued to work together in the post-project phase, and with DSTL. Throughout the life-course of the science and Security Programme the integrator team facilitated group discussions at workshops in highly relevant policy topics and as a result a number of projects have fed findings, through DSTL, into the Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) 2015. Moreover the bringing together of project teams to discuss common issues has led to a range of jointly organised workshops and publications.

The Science and Security Programme has now finished but we are still actively engaged in helping to facilitate a series of post-project workshops alongside the External Champion, RCUK's Partnership for Conflict, Crime &amp;amp;; Security Research (PaCCS). Notably in mid-2016 many of the Science and Security projects took part in a series of a policy workshops at the British Academy and Royal Society. These events were attended by over 50 high-level policy makers from the MOD, FCO, DSTL, Home Office and the National Crime Agency.

These workshops have led to the production of three new PaCCS Policy Briefings on:

? Open Source Data: Ethical and regulatory considerations http://www.paccsresearch.org.uk/policy-briefings/ethical-regulatory-considerations/ 
 
 ? The Governance of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) in Defense and Security: http://www.paccsresearch.org.uk/policy-briefings/governance-of-unmanned-aerial-vehicles/

? Social Media and the Armed Forces: http://www.paccsresearch.org.uk/policy-briefings/social-media-armed-forces/

These briefing have been circulated widely on the PaCCS network. http://www.paccsresearch.org.uk/news/launch-of-three-new-paccs-policy-briefings/</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>0E1917CA-FA63-43F6-BFED-3A34673259CB</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545a36e0d1aba9.28367305</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/K011367/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E88ECDEE-D58E-417E-A379-9FBB35647A90</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Science and Technology Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E88ECDEE-D58E-417E-A379-9FBB35647A90</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Science and Technology Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7A153974-B803-439F-95AD-724028C45340</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Security Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
