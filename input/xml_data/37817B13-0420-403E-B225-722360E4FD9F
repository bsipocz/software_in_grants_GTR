It will examine&amp;nbsp; the changes in taxation in Scotland that will happen as a result of the Scotland Act 2012 and changes that may take place should Scotland become independent or be granted more fiscal powers.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It will examine the effects on different groups in the Scottish population of universal and means tested benefits that are currently available from both the UK and Scottish Governments. It will hold a conference where scholars from different countries will be brought together to discuss the effects of constitutional change on taxation and spending within their environment.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Finally, it will conduct research on the types of personality characteristics likely to be associated with support for independence. Using techniques from behavioural economics, the research will examine whether willingness to take risks and concern for the future will play a role in influencing voting behaviour.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The users likely to benefit are principally the Scottish public, as well as particular interest groups in Scotland. However, others outside Scotland also have an interest in the outcome of the constitutional change debate and are catered for in the impact strategy.

The proposed project will generate at least 4 influential publications:
1. Contribution to IFS Green Budget for Scotland on Tax Proposals for Scotland
2. Paper on distributional aspects of universal benefits in Scotland
3. Paper with Liam Delaney on behavioural responses to fiscal uncertainty
4. E-book with Francois Vaillancourt on fiscal aspects of separation

Findings from these will be widely disseminated. The dissemination strategy is based on attempting to use as wide a range of methods as possible, including conferences, presentations, newspaper articles and media appearances. Likely venues for public presentations include Edinburgh, Inverness, Newcastle, Cardiff and Belfast. These events would be facilitated by bodies that can credibly argue to have a neutral position in respect of constitutional change - such as the RSE, DHI and BBC. Involvement with young people is important since the young will have to live with the outcomes of the 2014 referendum. In addition, 16 and 17 year olds may be allowed to vote in the referendum. Such events are likely to have high potential impact on key opinion formers. 

In addition, the project will work with NIESR (if the NIESR application is successful) to support any events that it might wish to engage with in Scotland, while NIESR will offer reciprocal support to us for London events.

In Scotland, newspaper articles relating to this research agenda are generally easy to place. However, because the quality newspaper market is shrinking, greater emphasis will be placed on social media. An &amp;quot;Economic Aspects of Constitutional Change&amp;quot; blog will be constructed along the lines www.irisheconomy.ie, which provides high quality academic commentary on Irish economic issues. This will be accompanied by a linked Twitter account. We would also support the establishment of a joint website and Twitter accounts for the Senior Research Fellowships. It is difficult to know how to measure the final impact of social media, though metrics such as number of hits should provide an initial measure of the extent to which issues raised by the research are of interest. 

We would expect to hold private meetings with specific stakeholders. These might include: Scottish Trades Union Congress, Confederation of British Industry, Institute of Directors, Scottish Chambers of Commerce, Scottish Financial Enterprise, Scottish Council of Voluntary Organisations and staff members of the Scottish Parliament. All of these bodies have been contacted and shown an interest in the project. Private meetings are likely to be more attractive to those who may not wish to take a public position on constitutional change. These meetings are likely to be an important aspect of the impact from this project, because they will inform such bodies in ways that may help them arrive at a public stance prior to the referendum.

The applicant will also promote the role of the ESRC through its ability to provide an independent, quality-assured support for this project.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-12-10</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>354614</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Description of new powers for the Scottish Parliament</gtr:description><gtr:id>6E88275C-F56C-47B4-914B-5A5B9FC33BDE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Watched by influential participants in refertendum debate</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5463c92545db50.26348028</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>YouTube Video - New Powers for the Scottish Parliament?</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zK35dZs1Ec&amp;list=UU8zeKC1P4UiAA9o9EzLVIqA</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Scottish Chambers of Commerce</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Scottish Independence - Collaboration with Scottish Chambers of Commerce</gtr:description><gtr:id>B3777F3F-3B82-41F9-8F50-E4243E9D15E0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Collaboration has resulted in the collection of a new survey on business attitudes to constitutional change.

Our research formed the basis for public and political debate. For example, it formed the basis of a discussion between Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and James Naughtie on Good Morning Scotland (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-27135448). It has been cited by documents produced by the Scottish Government (e.g. http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/0044/00449916.pdf)

In conjunction with our previous work on inequality, the impacts included the stimulation of public debate. We met with Gordon Brown who cited the work extensively in his book 'My Scotland, our Britain'. We presented the work at the Liberal Democrats Spring Conference 2014. We received requests for further information from groups including Taxpayers Alliance and Scottish Green Party. We were invited to give evidence at the Scottish Parliament Economy Committee 23 April 2014. The research was cited by Jackie Ballie MSP in a parliamentary question to Alex Salmond in First Minister's Questions, 23 Jan 2014.

The results of the research have been cited in policy briefings by the Scottish Parliament Information Centre. One example: http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/S4_EconomyEnergyandTourismCommittee/Meeting%20Papers/Papers_20140219.pdf

These powers were agreed by the Smith Commission in November 2015 and then embedded in the Scotland Bill 2015, which is currently making its way through Parliament. Neither the Smith Commission, nor the Bill detailed the &amp;quot;fiscal framework&amp;quot; that would surround the new powers. It will establish (1) how Scotland's block grant from Westminster will change, (2) how much the Scottish government can borrow and (3) the institutional arrangements necessary to establish good fiscal governance. These issues may seem esoteric, but in reality hundreds of millions of pounds are at stake.
The research on the fiscal framework formed part of the work supported first by the original Senior Research Fellowship on the ESRC &amp;quot;Future of the UK and Scotland&amp;quot; program. It was subsequently extended through funding from the ESRC Centre on Constitutional Change (ES/K007173/1). It has been communicated in many ways including:
? a special issue of the Oxford Review of Economic Policy on fiscal federalism, edited by the applicant; 
? two academic papers; two book chapters and two commissioned papers
? 29 blog posts for the Centre on Constitutional Change
? the development of a Twitter account which has 950 followers
? the development of a micro-simulation model to analyse newly devolved tax powers. 
? numerous television and radio broadcasts both to a UK-wide and a Scottish audience - ranging from the Today Programme to an appearance on a BBC Scotland TV comedy show.
? presentations to 67 different audiences in the UK, France and Canada since mid-2013. These ranged from the very academic at the Royal Economic Society in Manchester to town meetings in rural Scotland.
? appearances at 10 Parliamentary committees since 2013. These include the Finance Committee and Devolution (Further Powers) committees of the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Affairs Committee of the House of Commons. Most involved the provision of written evidence. The written and spoken evidence is frequently cited in the final reports.
Not only has this grant supported a substantial body of innovative research and knowledge exchange, it has also contributed to the ESRC's objective of increasing research capacity. David Eiser was employed as a research fellow on both ESRC projects. He has developed into an able researcher with a significant external profile, having co-authored several papers and book chapters with the applicant, and presented jointly at public and private meetings. He has also contributed to the research, knowledge exchange and outcomes in his own right. He has written 26 blogs for the Centre on Constitutional Change, made numerous external presentations and appeared as a witness in his own right at six Parliamentary committees.
The award has also opened opportunities for collaboration that have added to the capacity to conduct fiscal analyses in Scotland. Bell and Eiser have been awarded a Nuffield Foundation grant to joint with the ESRC-supported Institute for Fiscal Studies to research the fiscal framework. Collaboration with the ESRC-supported Centre on Population Changehas been 
The research has made use of important ESRC data assets. The microsimulation model uses the Understanding Society dataset. This resulted in the applicant giving a keynote address at the 2015 Understanding Society conference entitled &amp;quot;Scotland's changing fiscal framework through the prism of Understanding Society&amp;quot;. This model will add to the intellectual legacy of the research alongside the other academic output previously .
Communication activities have helped disseminate research findings, but the outcomes associated with this application have focused on key insights that involve extending, refining and exemplifying the implications of different designs for the fiscal framework. The Scotland Bill does not contain a blueprint for the fiscal framework. Instead, the Scottish and Governments are negotiating its structure in secret. The applicant's research suggested that a clear set of underlying principles and an open procedure were necessary if further constitutional upheaval was to be avoided. 
The research has led to the PI being consulted by both parties as the negotiations progress and by politicians who will ultimately decide whether the Scotland Bill will be approved by both the UK and Scottish Parliaments. Discussions have taken place with senior Treasury and Scottish Government officials, including the Chief Secretary as well as negotiators from both governments. 
Finally to the link from research and communication to outcomes: first, the PI was invited to act as Specialist Adviser to the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee inquiry into the devolution of public finances in the UK. The committee subsequently published a report entitled &amp;quot;A Fracturing Union? The Implications of Financial Devolution to Scotland&amp;quot;. Its arguments were aligned with the research findings. Further, Lord Hollick, chair of the Economic Affairs Committee, tabled an amendment to the second reading of the Scotland Bill attempting to halt progress on the bill until details of the fiscal framework were known. Specifically, the motion argued that &amp;quot;this House calls upon Her Majesty's Government not to schedule parts 2 and 3 of the bill in committee until the updated fiscal framework has been published&amp;quot;. Second, the Finance Committee of the Scottish Parliament, in its report on the fiscal framework, to which the applicant provided evidence, has also expressed concerns about both its design and process. Third, the applicant is advising the Constitutional Reform Group in its project to draft a new constitution for the UK. The initial draft takes a more principled approach to the design of the fiscal relations between the constituent nations of the UK.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>66870710-D610-41B9-A515-2019B407A541</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56cef4849786b9.47075675</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have found that:
1. An independent Scotland would face several important fiscal challenges. These include the variability of North Sea oil revenues, an ageing population, migration, the establishment of a market in government debt and the negative effects that the creation of a border might have on trade with rUK. The details of these issues are explored in one edited book, a special issue of the Oxford Review of Economic Policy and various journal articles and blogs. To give one example, which focused on the costs of funding state pensions in an independent Scotland, we showed how the costs of pensions would be affected by higher mortality rates in Scotland and the liquidity premium that would likely be attached to Scottish government debt. The liquidity premium would make Scottish pensions cheaper to buy, but taxpayers in Scotland would have to pay the cost in the form of higher interest charges. 
2. In the context of the referendum on Scottish independence, voters' attitudes to risk had a strong influence on their willingness to support constitutional change.
3. Scottish businesses, though guarded in their public pronouncements, tended to be more negative than positive about the economic implications of constitutional change
4. Bookmakers odds provided more reliable predictors of the referendum outcome than di the opinion polls. This finding is in line with other studies (mainly from the USA) of the reliability of &amp;quot;prediction markets&amp;quot; for political outcomes compared with opinion polls.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Although Scots voted by a considerable majority to reject independence, our work on fiscal issues is already being taken forward as a result of the work of the Smith Commission and in relation to the additional taxes proposed for Northern Ireland and Wales. We know that HM Treasury and the Scottish Government have been influenced by our thinking in relation to these issues.

Our work on attitudes to risk are likely to provoke interest among behavioural scientists on how such behaviours influence support or opposition to radical political change.

Our work on business attitudes to independence may be taken forward by the business community should there be further tax devolution in Scotland. Our use of an internet-based survey to gather business opinion was relatively novel for the Scottish Chambers of Commerce.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B93EF275-92C7-49F4-A20F-A0164D882F1D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54fec2f36e40a1.07795291</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.scotfes.com</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Design of Scotland's fiscal framework</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E6FCA01A-9CDC-4C17-9D1D-5679584F781B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Following our research into the design of Scotland's fiscal framework, David Bell was invited to be the specialist adviser to the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee, which was carrying out an investigation into the tax devolution proposed for Scotland in the week of the independence referendum in 2014. The investigation and subsequent report were influential in affecting public debate. In particular, the debate on the Scotland Bill in the House of Lords debate which took place on 29th February 2016 included the following amendment (57ZA) by Lord Forsyth of Drumlean:

Before Clause 13, insert the following new Clause-

&amp;quot;Approval of the fiscal framework

Nothing in this Part shall have effect until each House of Parliament has passed a motion expressing its approval of the agreement between the Scottish Government and the United Kingdom Government on the Scottish Government's fiscal framework.&amp;quot;

This amendment was intended to indicate concern over the lack of debate of Scotland's proposed fiscal framework both in the House of Commons and in the House of Lords. Although the amendment failed, this debate did provide one opportunity for an informed discussion of the implications of Scotland's new fiscal framework. The text from Hansard (referenced below) makes clear David Bell's contribution to informing this debate.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dd7ff0e04123.66717349</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201516/ldhansrd/text/160229-0002.htm</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Citation in the Scottish Affairs Committee publication &amp;quot;Demography of Scotland and the implications for devolution&amp;quot; linked to my appearance as a witness on behalf of the Royal Society of Edinburgh</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A0E8D628-C408-42EA-B353-632F06BEE1D7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This publication included a set of recommendations by the Scottish Affairs Committee.
