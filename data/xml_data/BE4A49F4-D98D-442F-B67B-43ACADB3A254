People who achieve greater attachment security have better relationship outcomes, are more confident in pursuing personal goals and better able to handle challenges, and exhibit greater well-being in general. Although attachment insecurity is often a chronic condition, it can and does change with new experiences. This project capitalises on interactions in romantic relationships, which evoke experiences that have powerful effects in regulating a sense of security. This research introduces relationship strategies that couples can adopt, including communication strategies that strengthen trust or confidence and perception exercises that aid in positive reinterpretations of interactions. Many couples desire to improve their relationship and acknowledge that, ideally, they would like to help each other thrive. However, they struggle to modify established interpersonal dynamics that may keep them stuck in a state of interpersonal anxiety (fear of losing a partner's acceptance and support) and/or interpersonal avoidance (discomfort with relying on others or intimacy). The relationship strategies examined in this research target each type of insecurity and are designed to be incorporated in typical couple interactions and daily events. These strategies may also be adopted in non-romantic settings by individuals who have endured negative interpersonal experiences.

The primary goal of this project is to identify strategies that affect couple communication and perceptions to achieve two aims: reduce insecure relational dynamics and enhance attachment security over time. In a series of randomized experiments, couples are assigned to strategies to target anxious tendencies or avoidant tendencies. The first aim is to examine communication strategies aimed at mitigating anxiety versus avoidance, each tested against a control condition. Such communication may reduce immediate relational tension but may not be sufficient to cause enduring changes in attachment security. The second aim, therefore, involves examining interactions and perceptions that can increase confidence among anxious individuals and increase trust among avoidant individuals. The effect of these security-enhancing strategies, combined with communication that mitigates insecurity, will be examined over an extended time. These relatively minor adjustments in couple interactions are expected to ripple into more profound changes in general attachment security, which benefits relationships and promotes meaningful activities that are fundamental to societal well-being.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project is expected to have both academic and societal impact, as it introduces new evidence based methods for bolstering attachment security and contributes to ESRC's aim of &amp;quot;enhancing quality of life, health and creative output.&amp;quot; Worldwide, psychological well-being matters to people as much as their economic well-being[6]. The outcomes of the project have broad implications for societal improvement, in both the UK and the USA, as attachment security lies at the heart of successful relationships and personal thriving. Although attachment security is typically regarded as unchangeable in adulthood, directing relationships to flourish or flounder, we argue that intimate relationships can be tapped as a crucial resource for bolstering attachment security. Many couples desire to improve their relationships and help each other flourish but do not know how to change the established interpersonal dynamics. 

We offer evidence-based intervention exercises that are designed to be easily accessed and adopted by the general public. General interest in improving relationships and feeling better about themselves is evident by the sheer volume of popular publications and websites offering advice on this topic, although the majority are not grounded in scientific theory. We aim to educate the broader public about the science behind the proposed interventions. Individuals who are not in romantic relationships will also be able to use the intervention exercises in the context of other close or interdependent relationships (e.g., family, friend, mentor, co-worker). They may be able to adopt some of the exercises alone as well, such as by using the written exercises to help them learn to trust others or using the communication strategies to quell a friend's anxious or avoidant tendencies. The mini-intervention strategies that will be established in our research are intended for a non-clinical population; we will ensure in our dissemination and educational activities that people are aware of this and that our exercises should not be regarded as therapy. People suffering from severe relationship issues (e.g., abuse), or those with mental health issues will be advised to seek counselling.

Moreover, we expect our strategies to be used by academics, practitioners, and public sector organisations in a wide variety of fields (see statement on Academic Beneficiaries). Our low-cost mini-intervention strategies will be of particular interest to policy makers and others in the public sector who are seeking to improve well-being of the general population, who would not otherwise be in need of extensive therapy or larger interventions. Based on findings of this project, practitioners may be able to offer advice and guidance to such non-clinical sample of couples and individuals, who are primarily seeking to improve the quality of their relationships. 

We plan to disseminate the findings of this study widely, to the academic community, private/public/third sector, and the general public. We will actively seek to disseminate our findings through publication of journal articles in a variety of fields and through presentations at conferences, universities, and other academic themed events. We also plan to disseminate our findings to students and the general public, with special attention given to sharing our findings with members of underrepresented groups who may be reluctant to seek out help. To do this, we will seek to have an online presence and will seek to pitch our findings through presentation at general public events. The UK PI will capitalize on being based in London to publicize findings through local and national media and at events aimed for general public. Finally, we will mentor and train future researchers (see Academic Beneficiary section), and we will teach students about the topic in our courses on close relationships and social psychology and during seminars for students of MSc in Psychology of Social Relations at Goldsmiths.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>27011</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2418AFC1-4C00-4D1B-A3A3-73F3405A4CB9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Revising Working Models Across Time: Relationship Situations That Enhance Attachment Security.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Personality and social psychology review : an official journal of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7407e25876648d94142bdbcd1a0e770c"><gtr:id>7407e25876648d94142bdbcd1a0e770c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Arriaga XB</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1532-7957</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a98a659432690.38578444</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N013182/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>56C9394E-9F52-4433-9619-6A14493473A8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
