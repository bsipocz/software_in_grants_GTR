The challenges of collective action predict that the groups most likely to be represented will have concentrated economic interests or intensely held beliefs, resulting in policies at odds with general public opinion. While such biases in representation are clear in theory, there is scant systematic evidence of disproportionate influence over government by a subset of interest groups. Further, social scientists know little about the degree of correspondence between the political preferences of interest groups and those of the public. Agendas and Interest Groups is a comparative project that for the first time will address concerns about the role of interest group influence by focusing attention on policy agendas and analyzing the circumstances under which specific types of groups and citizens find their issues represented before government. To estimate the degree of congruence between the concerns of citizens and the policy agendas of interest groups and government, we will interview representatives from a random sample of 100 interest groups in each of our four countries, survey the general public in each country about their policy wishes, and track three specific issues in each of three policy areas in each country. In mapping each country's public, group, and government agendas, we aim to address normatively important questions about the extent and causes of inequalities in representation.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We fully expect that government and civil service policymakers, as well as interest group advocates and citizens, will benefit from and make use of the proposed research. If we find for the first time, as we hypothesise, that at the agenda-setting stage of lawmaking certain interests consistently have greater influence than others, then less-well-represented interests may pressure government officials to create institutions that allow for greater input from underrepresented interests. In particular, if we find that a few, well-financed, business-orientated groups dominate over more numerous but less-resourced public interest citizens and organizations, then governments may feel compelled to better include public citizens and groups as policy agendas are formulated. For example, governments might create or refine consultation processes to more actively seek out diverse viewpoints, rather than allowing the 'consultation' to be a forum primarily for business groups to voice their preferences.

In addition, recent legislation creating voluntary or mandatory registers of lobbyists in Europe highlights the importance of collecting and making public data about the role of interest group lobbyists in political arenas. In Europe, where reporting standards trail behind those in the US, our findings have the potential to increase the transparency of lobbying and its influence in policymaking.

To maximize impact, we will develop a user-friendly, interactive website that will enable government officials, civil servants, journalists, interest groups, and ordinary citizens to search for data about group and citizen agenda preferences in four countries. We intend for the website to have interactive capabilities such as instant graphs and visualisation of the overlap of agendas among groups, citizens, and governments. Also to increase impact, we will hold a public engagement event at the University of Exeter that will host media outlets, policy practitioners, elected officials, interest group advocates, and academics from across universities and disciplines. This event will comprise both an academic workshop and a public impact event. Importantly, at this event we will issue and discuss policy recommendations based on best practices in different countries and sectors designed to reduce inequality and increase transparency in representative government. 

The investigators of the proposed research have solid records of accomplishment of external user engagement in such fora as the UN Global Compact website, the European Parliament's Committee on Constitutional Affairs, the European Parliamentary Research Service website, the American public affairs network C-SPAN, and speaking engagements with audiences of lobbyists, journalists, and policymakers. We will be supported in our impact activities by a professional website developer, the University press offices, and the UK postdoctoral research fellow.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>481727</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Our initial interviews have generated data suggesting that interest groups in the US and the UK virtually never initiate policy items; they are always responding to things that government is already doing.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In the long run, I believe our findings will inform all future studies of how and why lobbying occurs.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A0A8ECFE-05B8-4C84-9BAF-C789B9668A5C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58bd5f63965e14.20033243</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N018915/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4511FB20-8392-418E-809D-7701FACC03C9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Law &amp; legal studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>05111DBD-D3AB-4CEB-B45C-DD5885F4C460</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Comparative Law</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F7EEE6CD-E283-4BAB-BA5E-70B4B0F1F1A6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5455CCD0-BA52-40F6-8DAE-1BA1063EE624</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5BAFFA07-4055-4FE0-BE2D-FF47ECC4B6BF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Politics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5BBFA0D5-A9F8-43BE-A2A4-2C369538B45F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Stratification</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
