The striatum is the largest and most complex of these nuclei, and plays an essential role in the basal ganglia communication with other brain areas such as the cerebral cortex and the thalamus. When things go wrong in the striatum, devastating neurological consequences emerge; Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease are two examples of striatal malfunctioning. In Parkinson's disease patients find it very hard to execute movement, while in Huntington's disease patients cannot suppress unwanted movements. The compulsive elements of drug addiction are also thought to result from aberrant memories stored in the striatum. Therefore, understanding the way in which the striatum operates is essential to understand how motor control is accomplished in healthy people and why things go wrong in many neurological diseases. The striatum comprises tens of thousands of neurons interconnected in a complex manner. If we want to understand the way in which this nucleus carries out its computations, we have to understand first how striatal neurons process information coming from the cerebral cortex. This communication takes place through chemicals known as neurotransmitters. In the last twenty years it has become clear that nitric oxide acts as a neurotransmitter in the brain and in the striatum in particular. We know that nitric oxide is necessary for the normal operation of the striatum, and in particular for some forms of long-term synaptic plasticity, which is the cellular basis of motor learning. There is also evidence that nitric oxide signalling is altered in Parkinson's disease. However, how nitric oxide produced by the striatum controls the flow of information reaching the striatum from the cerebral cortex remains unclear. The main obstacle to obtaing this information has been that nitric oxide is only produced by a small number of specialised neurons that are difficult to identify and record from. This has now changed thanks to the introduction of transgenic mice in which the nitric oxide producing neurons of the striatum express a green fluorescent protein. Using these mice, it is possible to visually identify these neurons and study their interactions with other neurons. We will investigate these interactions using a sophisticated electrophysiological technique known as &amp;quot;paired recordings&amp;quot; in which two neurons are simultaneously monitored and stimulated electrically, so that their communication becomes apparent. We will also use other transgenic mice in which the nitrergic interneurons can be stimulated with flashes of light to investigate what happens when many of these nitrergic interneruons are activated simultaneously. These experiments will significantly improve our knowledge of the striatum and therefore provide new tools to understand and counteract the symptoms of neurological diseases caused by its malfunctioning.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The striatum is the main input nucleus of the basal ganglia and it is crucially involved in motor control and action selection. A massive glutamatergic input is sent from most areas of the cortex to the striatum. Corticostriatal synapses are of exceptional importance, as they are the cellular substrate of reward-mediated learning and display a form of long-term synaptic plasticity that requires not only the co-activation of pre- and postsynaptic neurons, but also release of dopamine. Corticostriatal communication is also controlled by striatal interneurons. In particular, a major role is likely to be played by the striatal interneurons that express nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and produce nitric oxide (NO). Long-term plasticity induced by tetanic stimulation of corticostriatal fibres can only be expressed if the NO signalling cascade is activated. Nevertheless, the nitrergic control of corticostriatal communication is still poorly understood. Previous experiments have used exogenous ligands to interfere with the NO signalling cascade. However, understanding the role played by endogenous NO in corticostriatal communication requires selective and controlled activation of NOS interneurons. To achieve this, we will use paired recordings and optogenetic activation of nitrergic interneurons, in combination with activation of corticostriatal fibres, using transgenic animals that express either green fluorescent protein or channelrodopsin in NOS interneurons. These experiments will reveal how endogenous NO controls corticostriatal communication on a short- and long-term basis. This will substantially improve our understanding of how the striatum processes cortical information in the normal brain and will suggest new pharmacological approaches for the treatment of diseases in which corticostriatal communication is impaired, including drug addiction and Parkinson's disease.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The societal and economic impact of this project (apart from the academic ones) mainly lies in two areas, clinical applications and robotics. 

Malfunctioning of the corticostriatal plasticity is thought to produce symptoms of devastating neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease and dystonia. Aberrant corticostriatal memories also underlie some defining features of drug addiction. From a clinical point of view, unraveling how the nitric oxide-producing interneurons of the striatum control corticostriatal communication can lead to the development of pharmacological treatments based on ligand able to interfere with nitric oxide production and with the nitric oxide signaling cascade. Pharmacological treatments for the disorders mentioned above are currently discovered through a trial-and-error process that is by its very nature rather slow and inefficient. The results of this project will provide a rational criterion for the application of nitric oxide related ligands (either on their own or in combinations with ligands for receptors activated by other neurotransmitters) in order to counteract the specific deficits in corticostriatal communication observed in neurological and psychiatric disorders.

The second area where benefits are likely to arise is the one of robotics and artificial intelligence. The basal ganglia, and the striatum in particular, are responsible for action selection and reward-based learning in humans and animals, but the computational details of these functions are still poorly understood. Since these properties are extremely desirable in artificial systems, robots and artificial neuronal networks based on basal ganglia-like architectures have been devised by several groups world-wide. These attempts to reproduce functional brain architectures have produced variable results in endowing artificial systems with skills and learning abilities typical of the basal ganglia. Undoubtedly, a major limitation is our limited knowledge of the role of striatal interneurons, including those producing nitric oxide, in striatal information processing. Progress in this area will foster the generation of machines much more capable of carrying out basal ganglia-like functions. In particular, artificial systems capable of action selection and reinforcement learning are likely to result from substantial advances in our understanding of the striatal circuits.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-12-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>435312</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>48D49746-B93E-4A7A-A1EF-B29EB56B8A1A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Mutual Control of Cholinergic and Low-Threshold Spike Interneurons in the Striatum.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Frontiers in cellular neuroscience</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a88ceda458aa3f8f4923dc038d9abd8f"><gtr:id>a88ceda458aa3f8f4923dc038d9abd8f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Elghaba R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1662-5102</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>585d713dbf1995.28236224</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>67196015-2D90-45BF-A9FD-0E735F8FDCE0</gtr:id><gtr:title>Dual Nitrergic/Cholinergic Control of Short-Term Plasticity of Corticostriatal Inputs to Striatal Projection Neurons.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Frontiers in cellular neuroscience</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/557ee0ea74face6e34e045775792a492"><gtr:id>557ee0ea74face6e34e045775792a492</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Blomeley CP</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1662-5102</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56e048d806da57.72532457</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/K022512/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>041997EB-CFD8-493D-B0F8-DFA35451D0BE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Neurological</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>CF950C9A-DB16-4E23-8AEB-94548777BCA1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>1.1  Normal biological development and functioning</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
