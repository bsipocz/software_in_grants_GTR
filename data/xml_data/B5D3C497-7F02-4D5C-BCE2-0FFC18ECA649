Deficiencies limit crop production in many parts of the world, and Zn is often deficient in the diet of humans subsisting on staple-food crops, causing severe health problems. An important strategy for dealing with this is to breed crops that are efficient in taking up Zn and concentrating it in edible plant parts. Rice is one of the main crops being targeted because of its global importance and the prevalence of Zn deficiency in populations subsisting on rice. 

However rice is unusual in its Zn relations compared with other cereals in two respects. First, it is mainly grown in submerged soils, and because of the peculiar biogeochemistry of submerged soils, Zn deficiency in the crop is widespread, affecting up to 50% of rice soils globally. Second, as a result of inherent physiological differences, little Zn is remobilized from existing plant reserves to grains during the grain filling growth stages, as in other cereals, so that Zn uptake appears to be one of the main bottlenecks limiting rice grain Zn contents. Research has shown that grain Zn concentrations in rice - already low compared with other cereals or pulses - are further reduced in Zn deficient soils, and large fertilizer additions are needed to overcome this. Dietary and crop Zn deficiency are inevitably linked in areas with low Zn soils, as in most parts of Asia where rice is the staple. Enhancing the Zn uptake capacity of rice varieties will therefore be crucial to increasing grain contents. It will also be important to understand long-term sustainability of growing high grain Zn rice under inherently Zn-limited conditions, and what can be done to avoid problems in the future.

Current research at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) is using classical plant breeding combined with molecular biological markers for useful plant traits to develop rice varieties with high grain Zn contents and improved yields on Zn-deficient soils. Research is also underway to enhance grain Zn through agronomic means, including fertilizer and water management. However progress in these activities, and in understanding long-term sustainability issues, is constrained by our poor understanding of the mechanisms underlying genotype differences, and of the dynamics of plant-available Zn in the soil within the growing season and longer term.

In recent research by members of the project team, we have shown that three key mechanisms enhance growth of rice seedlings in Zn deficient soil: (a) secretion from roots of Zn-chelating compounds called phytosiderophores and subsequent uptake of chelated Zn in the rhizosphere, (b) maintenance of new root growth, and (c) prevention of root damage by oxygen radicals linked to high bicarbonate concentrations. Studies with a limited set of genotypes suggest that Zn loaded into grains mostly comes from Zn uptake during the reproductive stages rather than by re-translocation from vegetative tissue. The mechanisms listed above in relation to seedling growth may also assure adequate Zn uptake during the reproductive phase. However, this has not been systematically investigated so far, nor have any genes related to reproductive-stage Zn uptake been tagged.

The proposed research addresses these knowledge gaps with an interdisciplinary approach linking fundamental research on soil biogeochemistry, molecular physiology and genetics with applied work on agronomy and plant breeding, with a conceptual framework provided by mathematical modelling. Our goal is to develop genotypes and management practices for growing high Zn rice in Zn deficient soils, suitable for resource-poor farmers. This will encompass agronomic interventions based on understanding of limiting factors for Zn uptake and translocation, and breeding approaches based on understanding of genetic factors controlling key tolerance mechanisms.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The project is in four work packages corresponding to the above four specific objectives. In WP1 we will use field, controlled environment and laboratory experiments to assess whether the mechanisms we have identified for seedling-stage tolerance of Zn deficiency universally separate tolerant from sensitive genotypes under seedling-stage Zn deficiency in different soils, and whether they continue to enhance uptake and grain filling during reproductive stages. The field experiments will be at four sites in the Philippines and four in Bangladesh, covering the range of soil types in which Zn deficiency occurs. We will use a common set of 12 contrasting genotypes. Methods will include a novel stable-isotope technique for studying uptake processes. In WP2 we will seek to identify loci and genes enhancing Zn uptake during vegetative and reproductive growth stages, leading to high grain Zn concentrations. Two methods will be used: (a) conventional QTL mapping based on a bi-parental cross, and (b) genome wide association mapping (GWAM) based on a panel of 178 genebank accessions. We will use the results for fine mapping and candidate gene identification. In WP3, we will develop and experimentally test mathematical models of Zn uptake processes in rice paddies, allowing for the biogeochemistry of Zn in submerged soils over the growing season and longer term, and the mechanisms of root-soil interactions. We will use the models and parameter values from the field and other experiments to assess strategies for increasing uptake in different environments and to predict the long-term sustainability of growing high Zn rices in Zn-deficient environments. In WP4 we develop rice breeding and management options and feed them into existing technology-transfer programmes at IRRI. This will include introgression of markers identified in WP2 into major Bangladeshi and Philippine rice varieties.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>In addition to the academic beneficiaries listed above, the project will benefit rice breeders and agronomists concerned with genetic improvement for Zn deficient soils and biofortification of rice varieties, and related management practices, and, in the medium- and longer-term, rice producers and consumers, particularly those in areas with Zn deficient soils.

By the end of the project we will have identified genetic markers for relevant traits for use in marker-assisted breeding, we will have begun introgression of the markers into major Bangladeshi and Philippine rice varieties, and we will have developed agronomic management recommendations for optimizing the function of these new varieties. We will facilitate the adoption of the new varieties and management strategies by farmers in Asia through existing technology-transfer programmes with which IRRI and the project team are involved.

A key issue in the adoption of new varieties with traits that do not have any obvious effects of yields - such as high grain Zn - is how to convince farmers to give up their tried and tested varieties in favour of new ones. The recent success of the Sub1 gene for submergence tolerance in rice has shown that adoption is fast if key traits are added to already-established varieties. In this project, by finding loci for better Zn uptake and loading into grains, we will allow modifications of existing varieties to be made, and will therefore facilitate smoother adoption. Hence we will strongly compliment IRRI's existing, less-targeted biofortification work.

These relevant technology-transfer programmes at IRRI are HarvestPlus, concerned with micronutrient malnutrition and biofortification; the Cereal Systems Initiative for South Asia (CSISA), for accelerated development and deployment of new varieties, management technologies and policies for cereal systems in South Asia; and Stress-tolerant Rice for Africa and South Asia (STRASA) concerned with varieties and technologies for rainfed rice systems. Each of these has components for germplasm testing with farmers, followed by seed multiplication, distribution, and impact evaluation. These programmes are designed for accelerated product development and deployment; the current project will assure that new genetic material and breeding tools will enter the product development pipeline.

CSISA is also promoting a decision-support tool for nutrient management called Nutrient Manager, which allows farmers to receive field- and season-specific fertilizer recommendations after answering an interactive series of 10-15 questions about their specific environment. This is available on the internet and, in the Philippines and coming soon to Bangladesh, through a mobile phone application via SMS messaging. A team at IRRI is in the process of including genotype information and irrigation and crop establishment recommendations in this decision tool. The findings of the proposed project, as generalised through the modeling in WP3, will allow fine-tuning of nutrient management advice for Zn-deficient areas.

The project's findings will be will transferred to breeders and agronomists at IRRI and its partners through direct interactions with members of the project team. The main route for dissemination to other scientists will be through publications in high impact journals and presentations at international conferences. All members of the project team have strong track records in publishing in top-ranked journals in their areas and in broad-reach journals. We will make all datasets and models produced in the project available to other researchers, following publication of papers, via websites at the project team's host organizations. 

IRRI has strong links with rice policy makers in Asia and globally. We will exploit these direct contacts. We will produce regular reports for websites and newsletters of our respective organizations, to communicate with policy makers and the general public.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-11-04</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>325427</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>We have found that rice genotypes tolerant of soil Zn deficiency produce more crown roots and they also have greater root efficiency (Zn uptake per unit root surface area). In both genotype groups root efficiency increases over time and with increasing planting density, and more so in the tolerant group. Having identified root development, possibly driven by crown root emergence, as a main tolerance factor, rice breeders may use this trait in their selection programs. We do not yet have sufficient understanding of root efficiency traits to do the same for root efficiency. 

Several high-performing genotype lines have been identified in a QTL mapping population for tolerance to vegetative stage Zn deficiency. The best lines outperformed the highly tolerant parent A69-1 and were recommended to IRRI breeders for multi-location testing in the IRRI problem-soil breeding program.

A first genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) was conducted with the aus subpopulation and several significant loci were identified. The most promising locus on chromosome 6 co-localized with a previously identified QTL. The GWAS analysis also identified possible new donors with even higher Zn deficiency tolerance than present in the best IRRI breeding lines. These donors have been handed to IRRI breeders for inclusion in further breeding efforts.

In field experiments on Zn uptake during grain-filling, we found consistent differences in genotype performance, e.g. IR55179 has good tolerance of seedling stage Zn deficiency and high grain Zn; IR69428 has poor tolerance of seedling stage Zn deficiency but high grain Zn. In Zn deficient soils, total Zn uptake differs less between genotypes than grain Zn content, and genotypes with high grain Zn contents tend to have smaller grain yields. This suggests high grain Zn in Zn-deficient soils is at the cost of reduced yield, which has important implications for rice breeders and agronomists.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>D00BBA52-BBAC-4E5A-B282-D88EF04356FF</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>56dda665a0f655.13718321</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Field experiments in the Philippines on genotype differences in tolerance of vegetative stage Zn deficiency showed consistent differences related to (a) inherent root development traits, (b) uptake per unit root surface due to root-soil interactions, (c) uptake per plant with closer planting density.

Several high-performing lines were selected from the QTL mapping population for tolerance to vegetative stage Zn deficiency. The best lines outperformed the highly tolerant parent A69-1 and have been recommended to IRRI breeders for multi-location testing in the IRRI problem-soil breeding program. A genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) has been conducted with the Aus subpopulation and several significant loci identified. The most promising locus on chromosome 6 co-localized with a previously identified QTL and in-depth analysis to identify putative candidate genes is ongoing. Additional phenotyping with association panels has just been done and data analyses are ongoing. One additional outcome of the GWAS analysis was the identification of possible new donors with even higher Zn deficiency tolerance than present in the best IRRI breeding lines. These donors have been handed to IRRI breeders for inclusion in further breeding efforts. Through gene expression profiling, several genes differentially expressed under Zn deficiency in crown tissue were identified. Mutants for these genes have been obtained and are being screened for presence of mutation/absence of gene expression to select confirmed mutants for genetic studies of crown root development.

We were unable to prove our original hypothesis that the mechanisms of genotype tolerance of Zn-deficient soil included secretion of Zn-mobilizing phytosiderophores from roots. However, our field experiments confirmed the importance of root-induced changes in the soil for tolerance of Zn deficiency, and we have obtained good evidence through novel X-ray computer tomographic imaging, linked to modelling, for the importance of soil CO2 and HCO3- uptake by roots. Very large concentrations of dissolved CO2 arise in submerged rice soils, particularly in the types of soil prone to Zn deficiency. We have shown that venting of CO2 through the roots will (1) alleviate toxicity of HCO3- to the roots, which is implicated in Zn deficiency stress, and possibly (2) make soil Zn more soluble and therefore available for uptake. We are currently completing new experiments and modelling on these questions, and that is the main focus of the proposed two-month extension. In separate work, we have made good progress on the long-term sustainability of growing high Zn rice in Zn deficient soils. We obtained separate funding for a PhD project on that topic, using digital soil mapping and modelling techniques to map the extent of Zn deficiency in different rice environments. That work will continue beyond the current SCPRID project.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Lines from the QTL mapping population with better performance compared to the tolerant parent have been recommended to IRRI breeders for inclusion in multi-location yields trials on Zn deficient/sodic soils. Rice accessions with exceptionally high Zn uptake from strongly Zn-deficient soil have been identified and given to breeders as potential new donors. Collaboration with HarvestPlus breeders responsible for high grain Zn rice had been disrupted by the repeated departure of the responsible breeder. Discussions with the current breeder in charge have been held, data exchanged and joint experiments planned. The observed planting density effect, with greater plant density correlated with better Zn uptake per plant, is being tested in the field experiments during the project's final field season. The experimental design was expanded to test two contrasting plant densities to determine if the early-season advantage of denser planting results in higher yield, higher grain Zn, or higher Zn uptake.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>90FEF865-6D22-4F35-8C7E-0B184F1FA100</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dda33aa58805.53967877</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AF030FDD-FB96-435D-8742-95E89D68EB86</gtr:id><gtr:title>Iron and zinc isotope fractionation during uptake and translocation in rice ( Oryza sativa ) grown in oxic and anoxic soils</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Comptes Rendus Geoscience</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/545967cd34922e7415bfada9a97fb4cf"><gtr:id>545967cd34922e7415bfada9a97fb4cf</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Arnold T</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56dd9158a16026.58550234</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3E98851F-A585-431D-8BB9-E47F4EFE8151</gtr:id><gtr:title>Measurement of isotopically-exchangeable Zn in Zn-deficient paddy soil</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>European Journal of Soil Science</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/15964134eb2b15ce5a6eb475ebcdc785"><gtr:id>15964134eb2b15ce5a6eb475ebcdc785</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Izquierdo M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56dd9158ddc9f0.98834216</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BFCC211D-64C2-4A8B-AF01-42267A0BDB6F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Rice Genotype Differences in Tolerance of Zinc-Deficient Soils: Evidence for the Importance of Root-Induced Changes in the Rhizosphere.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Frontiers in plant science</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/0b695ab43bec2f41bb0b7a96bc0a0ba4"><gtr:id>0b695ab43bec2f41bb0b7a96bc0a0ba4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mori A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1664-462X</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56dd91587a19f4.24635976</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>80FCDB06-8DB7-4D2B-AA07-445738D61EC0</gtr:id><gtr:title>Experimental Determination of Zinc Isotope Fractionation in Complexes with the Phytosiderophore 2'-Deoxymugeneic Acid (DMA) and Its Structural Analogues, and Implications for Plant Uptake Mechanisms.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Environmental science &amp;
