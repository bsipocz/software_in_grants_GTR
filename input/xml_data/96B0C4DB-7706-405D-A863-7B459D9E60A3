In several situations, nanoindentation techniques are the only viable ones with which to explore the behaviour of the test samples. In addition, these techniques are of an interdisciplinary nature and cover several scientific subjects, such as physics, chemistry, materials science and metallurgy, biological sciences and biomaterials, geophysics and geology. It is, therefore, particularly beneficial to organise a workshop in which scientists from different subjects can fully participate.With the above view in mind, we plan to organise the Third International Indentation Workshop at the Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, from 15 - 20 July 2007.We have already extended invitation to fifteen leading experts in their fields of research to give invited talks (see Case for Support for titles).The technical sessions of the Workshop are going to be spread over four and a half days. On each of the first four days there will be four invited talks and about 10 contributed oral presentations. Moreover, there will be about twenty Poster Presentations, which will be on display throughout the Workshop duration.On the final day of the Workshop there will be an Open Discussion Session at which participants will be invited to express their views freely. It is our experience that such discussions are extremely useful for the development of new ideas.It is the intention of the organisers to encourage young scientists to participate in the Workshop. We have, therefore, kept their registration fee at a very low level of just 125- per person. In fact, even for the regular participants the registration fee is relatively small.In order to encourage free andfruitful discussion amongst the participants, tea/coffee breaks have been organised in the same room of the Cavendish in which Posters and exhibition instruments will be displayed. Moreover, we have also organised a few social functions, such as welcoming parties and the Workshop Dinner, for enhancing scientific and collaborative interations amongst the participants.Wider dissemination of the knowledge generated at the Workshop will be through the publication of high quality manuscript in a leading UK scientific journal, namely Journal of Applied Physics D.It is very much hoped that the meeting will be very successful in enhancing scientific understanding and in developing international collaboration.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-04-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-07-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>12316</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/F016352/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E847DD9B-2053-4BC7-97A9-4213B185C968</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>561091A1-9FC9-4508-B1B2-2F3623E1FC9D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials Characterisation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
