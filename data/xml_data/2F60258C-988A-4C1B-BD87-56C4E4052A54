biosensors</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>BB/F004753/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Biosensors are devices of biological origin that can detect the presence of chemicals or other physical factors (e.g. light, temperature) in the environment. We are proposing to develop a whole new group of chemical biosensors, in particluar for sugars and simple ions like zinc, manganese and phosphate. These biosensors are examples of nanotechnology because they can sense chemicals at the atomic to cellular level. The particular biosensors we are proposing to develop are based on simple proteins called solute binding proteins. These proteins can be fused to two other proteins (CFP and YFP) to generate a fluorescent signal when they bind a specific chemical, which in this case will be a sugar or an ion. These nanosensors can be incorporated into living cells where they will report in real time on the concentration of the chemical they can sense. This is very important because it means changes in concentrations (flux) of chemicals can be measured. Many signalling mechanisms in biology depend on changes in the concentrations of metabolites so being able to sense these changes is crucial to many fundamental studies on biological action.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Biosensors are powerful tools for detection and monitoring of compounds in the environment and in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. They can be found in a number of forms including induction biosensors, electrical biosensors and FRET biosensors. These nanosensors operate at the atomic to microscopic/cellular level, providing the ability to detect the presence of compounds as well as in some cases rates of flux of compounds. Building on our isolation of a whole new suite of solute binding protein (SBP) induction biosensors, we now propose to develop a targeted group of these into FRET biosensors. FRET biosensors allow the real time monitoring of compounds in living cells and permit rates of flux to be measured. In particular we propose to express selected sugar, ion and pharmaceutically important SBPs and measure their ligand binding affinity. They will then be expressed as eCFP-SBP-eYFP fusion proteins for measurement and optimisation of their FRET signals. In addition 6-10 of the most novel of the SBPs will be crystallised to enable rational modification of their ligand specificity and FRET optimisation. In a radical new development we also propose to develop a targeted metagenomic library for the isolation of novel induction biosensors. This library will be composed of genomic DNA fragments from a selection of sequenced plant and environmental bacteria. We are confident such an approach can revolutionise the whole area of isolation of novel induction biosensors. In future work this technique could be applied to almost any compound of interest and provides extraordinary selective power.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>971949</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Montana State University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>SynSym Project</gtr:description><gtr:id>99893EA6-1AFD-4E1B-B6D3-CE370917E332</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A research grant from BBSRC/NSF was obtained to study Synthetic Symbioses.

SBPs have an innate ability to recognize their solute due to their intrinsic protein structure. The fact that on binding the chemical the protein changes shape means they can be used to develop very precise and specific methods of detecting that chemical. By adding fluorescent tags to a number of SBPs we developed several fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensors to detect sugars, dicarboxylates and aromatic compounds which can be used in a variety of situations.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The biosensors developed could be used in research to provide real-time information on the presence and concentration of the target solute.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>459C37BB-F8DA-45D1-9CDD-7B62DF488B52</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56bcc7b0aee6a0.98917999</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>95D12C15-8CDC-4F42-A8A0-7D78449C33A6</gtr:id><gtr:title>Biosensors for ligand detection.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Advances in applied microbiology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/0bc3a6fcccbbc1f113a13270666adeb4"><gtr:id>0bc3a6fcccbbc1f113a13270666adeb4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>East AK</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2008-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0065-2164</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>pm_55f93b593b565a12d</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>54C5812B-F29E-406D-B485-FC13109E942E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Bacterial Biosensors for in Vivo Spatiotemporal Mapping of Root Secretion.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Plant physiology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4641bf1e9437bb5c04814d1907cbe30f"><gtr:id>4641bf1e9437bb5c04814d1907cbe30f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pini F</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0032-0889</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fcbdfa2d962.28472663</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>214F4497-359B-4033-8404-428A9C8E0F65</gtr:id><gtr:title>Mining the Sinorhizobium meliloti transportome to develop FRET biosensors for sugars, dicarboxylates and cyclic polyols.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>PloS one</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e8b82ec903cff0e53858ed2e9edf7f94"><gtr:id>e8b82ec903cff0e53858ed2e9edf7f94</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bourd?s A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1932-6203</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>546b431b3b9590.68404188</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2D9B9C04-50DC-40AE-BEB3-AAB4CB1E3F4C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Characterisation of SalRAB a salicylic acid inducible positively regulated efflux system of Rhizobium leguminosarum bv viciae 3841.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>PloS one</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/3447a6989318c986c88d3f79add546de"><gtr:id>3447a6989318c986c88d3f79add546de</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Tett AJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1932-6203</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>546b14d1a3dcf8.59447620</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D8D547D5-2F43-4933-A6C3-ED0452932679</gtr:id><gtr:title>Rhizobia: from saprophytes to endosymbionts.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nature reviews.
