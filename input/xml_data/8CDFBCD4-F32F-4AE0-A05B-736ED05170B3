In particular,&amp;nbsp;it&amp;nbsp;analyses contestations of conceptions of masculinity and citizenship between objectors to military service, their supporters (primarily in the End Conscription Campaign - ECC) and the apartheid state.&lt;/p> 
&lt;p>The&amp;nbsp;research&amp;nbsp;contends that compulsory conscription and objection to it are performances in the public realm that are generative of political and personal identity. The most striking performance, of course, is military service itself (i.e. to be a soldier is supposedly to be a &lt;em>real&lt;/em> man and a patriotic citizen). Men who refused to be conscripted in apartheid South Africa were accused by the state as being cowards, traitors, enemies and homosexuals. The research analyses how men did or did not contest this. It argues that heterosexuality is used to discipline men (and women) in militarised contexts and that homophobic stigmatisation of objectors and peace activists are the means for achieving this.&lt;/p> 
&lt;p>It concludes that in South Africa, objectors did contest many aspects of militarised masculinity but found it much more difficult to tackle the links between sexuality and conscription and therefore attempted to appear ?respectable? rather than be radical.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>31591</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>This modern republic is not a 'boot camp for progressive ideals': Negative analysis of South Africa obscures the country's dynamism, says Daniel Conway</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>236FD8D6-843F-4886-A948-6781FCDA8006</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Article in response to Rory Carroll's 'How I never quite fell for South Africa' (G2, August 15, 2006)

There was accompanying media comment in leading South African newspapers. As the only substantial book (and accompanying set of articles/book chapters) on the End Conscription Campaign, my work has informed debates about white involvement in the anti-apartheid movement and the role of conscientious objectors. In 2014, a question asking secondary school students about the role and impact of the End Conscription Campaign, its strengths and weaknesses and its contribution to the anti-apartheid campaign was added to the school-leavers Matriculation examination. My work forms the key resource for school teachers and students to learn about the ECC, appraise it as a social movement and analyse it in relation to the wider liberation struggle in South Africa. The work has also been used by former ECC activists to discuss, debate and reflect on their roles in the liberation struggle and how those contributions are assessed and commemorated in contemporary South Africa.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2007</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>EAF5DD98-C368-41CE-8108-B9A0E0DA5C86</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54647926a90512.88187624</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This body of work explores the gendered dynamics of apartheid-era South Africa's militarisation, analysing the defiance of compulsory military service by individual white men and the anti-apartheid activism of the white men and women in the End Conscription Campaign (ECC). The ECC was the most significant white anti-apartheid social movement in South Africa.

In the book Masculinities, Militarisation and the End Conscription Campaign: War Resistance in Apartheid South Africa, published in 2012, I analyse the interconnections between militarisation, sexuality, race, homophobia and political authoritarianism and draw upon a range of materials and disciplines in producing this socio-political study. Sources include interviews with white men who objected to military service in the South African Defence Force (SADF), archival material including military intelligence surveillance of the ECC, ECC campaigning material, press reports and pro-state propaganda. I have published a number of peer reviewed journal articles and book chapters relating to these themes and reflecting on my research methods.

In 'Queering Apartheid: The National Party's 1987 'Gay Rights' Election Campaign in Hillbrow' (developed during my post-doctoral work and published in December 2009 in the Journal of Southern African Studies), I explore heteronormative discourses of sexuality and race drawing from archival material and developing the understanding of whiteness, citizenship and homo-nationalism in late-apartheid society.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>As a set of articles, chapters and a monograph, my work is drawn from, debated and developed by other academics, but also used by school based learners as part of their Matriculation preparations and by other South Africans interested in exploring the apartheid past and white activism against apartheid. The work is also relevant to war resistance movements in contemporary Israel and Turkey.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>AF45160E-EDF4-4EE4-A2AB-21D472C50AD7</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54647ad62a73c5.58055184</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://oro.open.ac.uk/36732/1/__hulse_dc22295_Block%205%20teaching_Conway%20somewhere%20on%20the%20border%20of%20credibility.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">PTA-026-27-1210</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F7EEE6CD-E283-4BAB-BA5E-70B4B0F1F1A6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
