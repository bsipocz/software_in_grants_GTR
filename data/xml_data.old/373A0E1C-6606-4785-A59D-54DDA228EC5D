A standard answer is that pretty much all you need to know is the meanings of the words in the sentence together with knowledge of the way they are put together (i.e. an understanding of sentence structure). However, in recent years this standard answer has come under serious pressure from those who argue that knowledge of linguistic meaning requires a wealth of knowledge about the context of utterance. For instance, imagine that Jill is a solicitor who likes to sail in her spare time. If we are having a conversation about our friends' hobbies and I utter (1) it seems that I say something true; in this context, I'm right when I say that Jill is a sailor. However, now imagine that we are having a conversation about our friends' professions. In this context if I utter (1) it seems that I say something false; in this context it is not right to say of Jill that she is a sailor. What this seems to show is that grasp of linguistic meaning requires an extremely high level of sensitivity to the way in which words are being used in context. That is to say, cases like these seem to demonstrate pervasive context-sensitivity in our language. 
However, pervasive context-sensitivity is problematic for it undermines the idea that language understanding could be underpinned by a special, encapsulated mental 'module' which deals just with language. Instead, it seems to show that understanding language requires a wealth of general and cultural knowledge, for instance about what is relevant in a context and what someone else is thinking. If it is right to think that language understanding is this very rich kind of enterprise, then this in turn has serious repercussions for such things as designing interventions for patients who have linguistic impairments (e.g. patients with aphasia, or those on the autistic spectrum) and for computer modelling of language understanding (since identification of relevant contextual features is something which is notoriously difficult within artificial intelligence circles).
The aim of this project, then, is to create an international network of researchers to investigate the evidence for pervasive context-sensitivity, and to explore the theoretical positions which have emerged in this area. For instance, the project will explore whether reactions to cases like (1) show cultural variation, and what an answer either way tells us about the debate. We will look to open up discussion in this area to the input of researchers in cognitive psychology, exploring more thoroughly the empirical predictions made by each philosophical stance in this area and how these predictions might be tested experimentally. Overall, the project will provide a synoptic overview of the problems and solutions which have emerged in the recent, lively debate about pervasive context-sensitivity and identify the best way to take the debate forward, both within the arts and humanities research community and beyond.
The proposed network will primarily involve researchers in the UK and China, making use of extant expertise in both countries but forging new collaborations which we hope will yield exciting discoveries. The network will involve two face-to-face meetings (one in China and one in the UK), together with a range of further activities (including video conferencing, remote PhD supervision, and on-line collaboration via a dedicated, open access website). The network hub will extend to include researchers from beyond the arts and humanities community, early career researchers, and non-academic stakeholders. By instigating an inclusive dialogue of this kind it is hoped that original and important results will be delivered and understanding in this key area will be significantly advanced. Finally, the connections and infrastructure developed for this project will provide a springboard for future UK/China collaboration.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research?
This research network will benefit all user-groups where an understanding of the nature of linguistic understanding is important. These include:
- Practitioners treating patients with specific language impairments, e.g. speech and language therapists, and those treating patients with more general cognitive impairments which include a component of linguistic inhibition (e.g. autism).
- Third sector bodies supporting patients in the above categories.
- Those designing the language component of the early years curriculum, both within the UK and beyond.
- Those involved with computer modelling of natural language, e.g. computer (machine) translation.
- The general public with an interest in mind and language.


How will they benefit?
By facilitating the creation of new research collaborations, across international and disciplinary divides, a more robust understanding of the problems and solutions involved in pervasive context-sensitivity will be developed. This understanding will be communicated to user-groups via new and existing PI and CI contacts and via the website. The website and blog will be designed with the end users of research in mind (for instance, the input of end users will be sought at the design stage to find out what would be most useful for them on the site and how information can best be communicated to them, e.g. blog postings, emails, summary reports, etc.). By building research capacity and international collaboration in this area we can:
- Keep a targeted audience informed of new research findings, publications, relevant events, etc.
- Promote closer integration between end users and researchers in this important area
- Promote closer integration between different user-groups (via on-line discussion forums)
- Engage the public in thinking about the issue of pervasive context-sensitivity, and the nature of language understanding and human intelligence more generally.
Finally, skills development is a key component of the role of the local co-ordinators who will develop intellectual and organisational skills giving them a competitive advantage in securing work in any sector.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-12-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>20844</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Peking University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>China, People's Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Philosophy</gtr:department><gtr:description>Institute of Foreign Philosophy, Peking University</gtr:description><gtr:id>11EDCCA8-375F-49E1-A150-D53826FBED19</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Borg and Hansen held discussions with Peter Momtchiloff OUP about producing a volume of collected papers from the two Pervasive Context conferences. This would have been a multidisciplinary volume, including contributions from philosophers, linguists and psychologists. However, despite interest from OUP, we ultimately decided not to pursue publication via an edited collection, but Borg and Hansen have published findings from the project in three full length journal articles (see publications section).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>564333cf7c5f88.85379582-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Colleagues at Peking took an active role in the virtual research meetings, making constructive and valuable contributions to these research meetings and securing a large and engaged audience for the sessions in China. At the Beijing conference, Prof. YE Chuang presented a paper. Prior to the conference, they organised, chaired and ran the masterclass sessions. Dr. LI Qilin dealt (extremely efficiently) with administrative aspects of the conference from the Chinese side (e.g. issuing invitation letters to allow participants to secure visas, arranging accommodation and transportation, providing rooms and publicising the conference within China).
Both Prof. YE and Dr. LI attended the second Pervasive Context conference at UoR and Dr. LI presented a paper. 
Finally, although funding was initially sought from the AHRC for all aspects of this network, once this funding was secured colleagues at Peking were able to apply (successfully) for institutional funds to help defray costs for the Beijing conference. Due to the financial contribution of the Chinese government, we are thus in a position to return &amp;pound;2208.72 to the AHRC as underspend on the award. 
The AHRC network has been instrumental in strengthening Reading/China links in Philosophy. For instance, it has led to a successful application for Postdoctoral funding from the Chinese Government to allow Dr. ZENG Guocai (Shanghai Jiao Tong University) to visit the University of Reading for 3 months (Jan-March 2017) to work with Prof. Emma Borg on issues at the semantics/pragmatics interface (see 'Further funding' section).</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>2014-5: The research team at University of Reading have taken the lead in organising the five virtual research meetings held by the network during 2014-15 and played a significant role in the organisation of the first 'Pervasive Context' conference, held in Beijing, 24th and 25th October 2015. In three of the virtual meetings, members of the Reading team (Borg, Hansen and Grindrod) introduced material and led discussion. At the conference, both Borg and Hansen gave talks. Before the conference, they also both gave 'masterclass' sessions to staff and students at Peking University, setting out the background topics for the conference. 
2015-6: The research team at Reading took the lead in organising three virtual seminars in Spring/Summer 2016 (following the Beijing conference in Autumn 2015). These meetings were led by members of the Reading team (Borg, Hansen, Grindrod). The Reading team also organised the second Pervasive Context conference, held at the University of Reading Saturday 25th and Sunday 26th June 2016, with a masterclass proceeding this on Friday 24th. Our local co-ordinator, Jumbly Grindrod, also presented a paper at the conference.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Virtual research meetings</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4287BDA4-E3FC-47E1-956E-89E390164335</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The group held 5 virtual meetings during the academic year 2014-15, as follows:

? Wednesday 29th October: organizational meeting.
? Wednesday 10th December: Emma Borg, 'Exploding Explicatures'. Presented by Emma Borg.
? Wednesday 18th March 2015: Peter Ludlow (2013), Living Words, Ch. 3. Presented by Emma Borg.

? Wednesday 10h June 2015: Augustin Rayo (2013) 'A Plea for Semantic Localism'. Presented by Jumbly Grindrod.
During 2016, 3 virtual meetings were held:
? Tuesday12th January 2016: Schoubye, A. &amp;amp; Stokke, A. (2015), 'What is said?'. Presented by Nat Hansen.
? Tuesday 1st March 2016: Ernie Lepore &amp;amp; Matthew Stone (2015), Ch. 13, Imagination and Convention. Presented by Emma Borg.
? Tuesday 22nd March 2016: Michael Blome-Tillmann (2009), Ch. 2, Knowledge and Presuppositions. Presented by Jumbly Grindrod.

Meetings were attended by the main network members:
? Prof. Emma Borg (PI)
? Dr. Nat Hansen (Co-I)
? Prof. Chuang Ye (Peking)
? Dr. Qilin Li (Peking)
? Dr. Mark Pinder (Analysis Post-doctoral Fellow, Reading)
? Dr. John Maier (Peking)
? Jumbly Grindrod (PhD student and local organiser, Reading).
? Guanglong Luo (PhD student and local organizer, Beijing)
Together with other staff and students from the two institutions (numbers attending ranged from around 12-25). The meetings were very enjoyable and philosophically profitable, allowing extended discussion of core issues at the semantics/pragmatics interface, and benefitting from the different perspectives on the topics which colleagues at different institutions bring. Furthermore, the technology underpinning the meetings worked extremely well, allowing discussion to proceed in a natural way. The only technological drawback occurred when we attempted to add participants from other institutions (alongside Reading and Beijing): here the instructions from Reading's Information and Technology Support for new members joining the meetings were somewhat complicated and made joining via the professional system too laborious (additional members thus simply Skyped in, but there was a concomitant loss of sound and visual quality for those members). However, the group took steps in 2015 to make it easier for new members to join (e.g. Jumbly Grindrod produced a simplified, step-by-step instruction manual) and this technological glitch was at least partially overcome for the next round of meetings in 2016.

One MA student (at Southampton University) got in contact to attend the virtual meetings and has now started a PhD at Reading (securing an internal studentship from the University of Reading), supervised by Emma Borg and Nat Hansen.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5643375c87d047.72691348</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.reading.ac.uk/pervasive-context/pc-news.aspx</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014,2015,2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>50000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>China, People's Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>CNY</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>China</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>zh_CN</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>China Postdoctoral Science Foundation Management Department of Education Ministry, China.</gtr:description><gtr:fundingOrg>National Science Foundation China</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>2016M591659</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>7F6E15EF-F7ED-44FC-827B-954695BBE43D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58aae9fd180f17.83649026</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The Pervasive Context network is still on-going, however the primary economic and societal impact it has achieved thus far is as follows:
1. Initiating and increasing contact between philosophy researchers at the University of Reading and at Peking University, leading to a much enhanced profile for the work of UK scholars within China and opening up the prospect of further collaborative work (e.g. an application for a Newton Fund Advanced Fellowship, to allow a Peking colleague, Dr. LIANG Yizhong, to come to Reading for two years research work, has just been made).
2. Initiating contact with researchers at Yale-NUS College, Singapore, opening discussions about future collaborations for teaching at Reading University's Malaysian campus and thus increasing our impact on the educational sector in this geographical area.
3. Initiating contact with researchers at the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence in Cognition and its Disorders, Macquarie University (http://www.ccd.edu.au/), where Borg is now an Associate Investigator.
4. Enhancement of career opportunities and skills acquisition for early career researchers and local coordinators (e.g. through the masterclass sessions).
In the long-term, 1-3 are directed at fostering the global economic performance, and specifically the economic competitiveness of the United Kingdom, through a greater role for UK research within China and the rest of the world.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>84E21C2A-CED0-4E4A-80FB-7B4A9A352485</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5645fdb073eb78.92590638</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Creative Economy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project thus far has yielded important insights into the nature of, and best theoretical approach to, linguistic context-sensitive. For instance, one important finding of the project thus far has involved our investigation of cross-linguistic responses to linguistic context-sensitivity: we have found preliminary evidence of divergent intuitions regarding linguistic context-sensitivity across native English and Mandarin speakers, opening up the possibility that cultural variation is a factor that must be accommodated in this area. We have also explored divergent findings amongst native Spanish speakers concerning so-called 'retraction cases' (e.g. when a speaker will withdraw an earlier claim to knowledge), which have been used to support one view on pervasive context (known as 'semantic relativism'). Finally, we have engaged in an exploration of somewhat theoretically neglected areas of linguistic practice, such as lying and misleading, with some group members using these as a way of resisting the core claim that contextual features are pervasive throughout linguistic meaning. 

The overall aim of the project is to advance understanding on the crucial issue of context-sensitivity in language by bringing together the expertise of theorists working on this topic in the UK and in China. Thus the project also has ancillary aims concerning the building of research infrastructure and the dissemination and integration of research work. In this regard, the project has also been crucial in the following developments:
? developing a new international research network, primarily involving researchers at the University of Reading and Peking University (who now interact on a regular basis to discuss research findings), but including members working in France, Germany, Spain, Australia and the US. This international network, created and supported by email contact, the project blog and webpage, virtual research meetings, and face-to-face interaction at the Peking conference in October 2015, will form one of the lasting legacies of this research award. 
? fostering other substantive UK-China connections for the Philosophy Department at University of Reading, including: joint research on cross-cultural aspects of pervasive context between Nat Hansen and Dr. Jing Zhu at Sun Yat-sen University, an invitation to Prof. John Preston to serve as the Director of the 2015 Summer Institute on Philosophy of Science, at Huaqiao University, Fujian province, China (Preston was subsequently was made a visiting Professor at Huaqiao University), Ms. Zhao Yang and Dr. Shi Yugang, from Shaanxi University of Technology, China, were visiting academics in the Reading Department during 2015-16, and Professors Preston and Max de Gaynesford were both invited speakers at a major philosophy conference in Guangzhou, China. The AHRC network award has provided a significant increase in the visibility of Reading's (and hence the UK's) research in philosophy within China and we are hopeful that these connections will continue to grow. 
? Developing interdisciplinary connections and awareness of the issues surrounding pervasive context. For instance, although network members are primarily drawn from philosophy, they also include members working in linguistics, psychology and computer science, and as a result of the network Borg was invited to be a keynote speaker at the 9th CONTEXT conference, an interdisciplinary event primarily involving computer scientists and linguistics, see http://cyprusconferences.org/context2015/, allowing her to present project findings to wide audience. The project has also led to her being invited to become an Associate Investigator at the Centre for Cognition and its Disorders, Macquarie University, Australia (an ARC Centre of Excellence).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Of the potential beneficiaries identified for this research (outlined in the Pathways to Impact Summary) two have proven most promising:
a. Practitioners treating patients with specific language impairments: the PI opened lines of communication with Speech and Language practitioners at the University of Reading at the start of the project, seeking their views on formulating key questions for the research and on the kind of information it would be helpful to have on the project website. In addition, the PI has recently been invited to write an overview article summarising project research for *The Linguist* magazine (whose readership includes applied linguists) . Finally, at the end of the award the PI will write a briefing note, summarising findings relevant to this sector, and disseminate this as widely as possible.
b. Those involved with computer modelling of natural language, e.g. machine (computer) translation. The PI and Co-I made contact at an early stage of the project with a computer scientist (Prof. Meehrnoosh Sadrzadeh at QMUL), and this led to the production of a joint document summarizing the different notions of context that philosophers and computer scientists are working with. While impact here is not immediate, all three researchers remain committed to keeping lines of communication open and considering ways to take this connection forward. In addition, Emma Borg was a keynote speaker at a significant interdisciplinary conference (9th CONTEXT conference), where she was able to disseminate project findings to a wide audience (primarily computer scientists and linguistics), many of whom are engaged in substantive relationships with large technology firms (Google, Apple, etc). There have been a number of follow up discussions from this conference, constituting impact for the project across academic disciplines and perhaps beyond.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>22EA9187-1408-46D8-922D-0D6C6E5C3FE7</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5645fd31661928.87075802</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www.reading.ac.uk/pervasive-context/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>61C28758-EBAA-4A60-9AE2-7CDC453FC363</gtr:id><gtr:title>Color adjectives, standards, and thresholds: an experimental investigation</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Linguistics and Philosophy</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/0ab5bd5e3f82b8a5040ccebdec9749d5"><gtr:id>0ab5bd5e3f82b8a5040ccebdec9749d5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hansen N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58aab6e5e85992.62207732</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>512D9F45-CCB9-48AD-9D41-E45406120503</gtr:id><gtr:title>Color Comparisons and Interpersonal Variation.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Review of philosophy and psychology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/0ab5bd5e3f82b8a5040ccebdec9749d5"><gtr:id>0ab5bd5e3f82b8a5040ccebdec9749d5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hansen N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1878-5158</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58aab63488fe36.15866789</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>FC94D42E-5DE6-469D-9857-5C0684D07D5E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Exploding Explicatures</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Mind &amp;
