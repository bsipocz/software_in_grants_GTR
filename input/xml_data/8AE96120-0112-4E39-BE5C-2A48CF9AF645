As a liquid is cooled, it often undergoes crystallization, where the molecules arrange into an ordered pattern. The most common example is water turning into ice. However, such crystallization can be avoided by cooling at a fast rate. The liquid molecules then move slower and slower upon cooling and if the cooling rate is high enough there is not enough time to rearrange into an ordered pattern before all long-range motions come to a halt; thus, the structure remains disordered and liquid-like but the material is hard - the resulting solid is called a glass. 
Glassy materials are important in a wide range of man-made materials and applications including battery electrolytes and electrodes, solar cells, pharmaceuticals and most plastics. Neither the microscopic mechanisms involved in glass-formation nor the behaviour of the glassy state are well understood; this is remarkable since humans have been producing glass for thousands of years and glasses have been naturally formed by geological processes for millions of years. Thus, reaching an understanding of glasses and their formation is a key unsolved problem in both fundamental science and technology. 
Remarkably, an analogy can be drawn between and the molecules (size: 0.1-10 nm) of molecular glass-formers and the behaviour of particles (size: 0.1-10 microns) suspended in a liquid, so called colloids. For colloids, glass-formation is controlled by the concentration of particles within a certain volume; for low particle concentrations the system is a liquid but as the concentration is increased the system gets crowded, which leads to the formation of a glass. Practical examples include paints, emulsions, lubricants and thickeners. The advantage of using colloids as a model system to study glass-formation is the large particle size, which means that the colloid motions can be studied using light as a probe, together with the great control of properties such as colloid size, elasticity and inter-particle interactions. 
In this work we will use a versatile colloidal model system consisting of gel particles swollen in a solvent, so called microgels. In addition to their role as model systems, such microgel suspensions are important in applications including biosensing and medical diagnostics, chemical separation technologies, oil recovery, pharmaceutical delivery, and switchable materials.
We will synthesize microgel particles with varying mechanical properties, by controlling the cross-linking of the particle gels. Each microgel batch will be characterized with regards to particle size, gel structure and mechanical properties. We will then study how these microgel suspensions form glasses as the particles crowd the volume upon concentration. Both the arrangement and the motions of the microgel particles will be studied as the glassy state is approached, using light scattering and rheology techniques. Light scattering studies yield information about the individual microgel structure, the microgel particle arrangements and the microgel motions over a wide range of time-scales (10 ns-1000 s). With rheology, the response of the material to a mechanical disturbance is investigated. 
Specific aims of the study are to (i) find the relationship between single microgel properties and the corresponding suspension arrangements and motions as the glassy state is approached (ii) determine which types of microgel motions are relevant to the glass formation process and how these motions are inter-related (iii) investigate how an applied shear affects and eventually 'melts' a microgel glass.
This work addresses questions that are key to an understanding of glassy materials in general. By systematic studies of an excellent model system, we aim to form a benchmark for future glass-transition work.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Disordered solids are common and important both in technological applications and in nature and include molecular glasses, colloidal suspensions, granular systems, emulsions, foams, pastes, polymer gels and biological tissues. Thus, disordered materials impact applications including drug delivery systems, amorphous pharmaceuticals, biosensors, industrial emulsions, paints, lubricants and thickeners and energy related materials such as polymer battery electrolytes, fuel and solar cells. Despite their importance, we generally neither understand their behaviour nor the microscopic mechanisms responsible for their formation. To resolve these questions would both lead to technological innovations and to improved and more environmentally friendly every-day industrial products. Moreover, the model system chosen to study dynamic arrest and non-equilibrium behaviour in disordered solids in this work, microgels, are key elements in medical, biosensing and diagnostics applications, in chemical separation technologies, oil recovery, pharmaceutical delivery systems, in switchable materials and in novel optical techniques. They are also regularly used to control the rheological properties of industrial products such as paints, motor oils, foods, cosmetics and inks. Thus, a better understanding of microgel suspensions alone would strongly benefit systems of key scientific and industrial interest within the UK.

Generally, the work outlined in this proposal will be of importance to a vast range of present and future applications and products both within industry and academia, both within the UK and globally. The research outcome could impact any area that use disordered materials and particularly microgels in materials or applications development and production and proper understanding of the materials would create new avenues for innovative materials design. We particularly stress the important role of disordered systems in the development of new materials for energy-related and medical applications, which are both key strategic areas for research and development in the UK. Moroever, the strategic importance of understanding the physics of non-equilibrium matter in general is highlighted by the EPSRC signposting on &amp;quot;Matter far from equilibrium&amp;quot;. The importance of this project for the UK in general is further strengthened by the fact that it directly impacts 3 out of 4 of the recently identified EPSRC Physics Grand Challenges: &amp;quot;Emergence and Physics Far from Equilibrium&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Nanoscale Design of Functional Materials&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Understanding the Physics of Life&amp;quot;. It is also important to point out the close relation between the physics of non-equilibrium solids and non-equilibrium behaviour in large-scale systems such as traffic systems, animal populations, human societies or financial markets, all of which are areas of direct importance to the UK society. 

The outcomes of the grant work will be directly fed into teaching in several undergraduate modules at the University of Leeds and used in University open day presentations, which will further spread the knowledge and understanding of disordered materials and their behaviour within the UK.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-05-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-11-29</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100410</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation on microgel work at the 10th Annual European Rheology Conference, Nantes, France (April 2015)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D783D68B-72A8-449D-A477-4F13C43EDEA5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Poster presentation of work that came out of the wider work on microgel initiated by the First Grant work on microgels (EP/J02113x/1).

Many formulations e.g. in foods, or in soft solids such as pastes (e.g. tooth paste) have microgel-type components and the fundamental work of this grant thus feeds well into industrially motivated studies and developments. This work led into securing one PhD student who works between Engineering and Physics in Leeds focusing on industrially relevant microgels for consumer products and who is co-funded by industry. Moreover, another PhD student is starting in April 2017 and is focusing in parts on food grade microgels of direct relevance for food related industrial applications. A new PhD student started in April 2016 who is working together with J. Mattsson in physics, D. Read and O. Harlen in Maths at Leeds to develop novel computing techniques for the packing of soft colloids. These techniques consist of a combination of Finite Element modelling of the colloids together with MD simulations where thermal fluctuations are taken into account. This work has the potential to focus on a range of industrial applications and develop computer simulation technologies to screen behaviours of relevance to industry in a cost-efficient manner and aid the design of microgel systems in applications as e.g. structural modifiers.</gtr:description><gtr:id>6F598625-823E-42A3-943A-AE14F3B687B5</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>543c2819a1e1a5.50645522</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>A series of batches of soft colloids based on so called microgels, which are spherical cross-linked polymer networks, in our case with a diameter of 100-200 nm, were synthesized. Particles with varying concentrations of cross-links were produced, which corresponds to varying swelling and single particle elastic properties. The size and polydispersity of the particles of each batch were determined as a function of temperature using light scattering. We were able to produce particles across a wide range of cross-link densities with radii of 100-200 nm. Moreover, the compressional single particle moduli were determined using light scattering on microgels suspended in calibrated aqueous dextran solutions. We found that the variation of cross-link densities corresponds to a highly systematic variation of compressional moduli. Moreover, Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) techniques were used to characterise the single particle properties for particles deposited onto silica surfaces both in terms of particle shape, adhesion and mechanical properties. We were able to both determine 2D maps of the Young's moduli for the sedimented particles as well as determine the detailed deformation behaviour under load. Moreover, we have performed detailed AFM measurements following the shape and response of the particles as a function of temperature across the deswelling transition. This transition has also been investigated using static light scattering, dynamic light scattering and Flory-Rehner theory has been applied to investigate the observed behaviour. The used techniques thus provided very detailed information about the single particle properties.
 
The volume fractions of aqueous suspensions of the different particle batches were determined using capillary viscometry. Moreover, oscillatory and steady state rheology were performed as a function of microgel particle concentration for each batch. We were able to characterise both the microgel glass properties and the dynamic arrest as a function of particle concentration using rheology and light scattering. We also investigated the difference between different routes to dynamic arrest/flow, including variation of the particle concentration, variation of the temperature and variation of the shear rate.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Several routes have been initiated :

- The detailed experimental knowledge developed in this work about single and collective particle properties is presently being compared with novel computer simulations on soft colloids. A new PhD student started in April 2016 who is working together with J. Mattsson in physics, D. Read and O. Harlen in Maths at Leeds to develop novel computing techniques for the packing of soft colloids. These techniques consist of a combination of Finite Element modelling of the colloids together with MD simulations where thermal fluctuations are taken into account. 

- To feed the fundamental knowledge into more industrially relevant microgel systems. A PG-student co-funded by industry who started 1 October 2014 is involved in this work. This work is progressing well and detailed light scattering (using the 3D-PCS system in Leeds) and rheology studies are being performed on a system which combines both fundamental as well as industrial strong interest.

- To investigate microgels with more complex or different size distributions, shape, interactions and/or elastic radial distributions. We have initiated work to produce microgels with highly controlled size and elasticity distributions. A new PhD student is starting in April 2017 who is focusing on investigating well controlled microgel suspensions using light scattering, rheology and confocal microscopy and he will investigate both model systems and food grade systems of direct relevance for industrial applications.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C79F0EC2-AD88-4317-A9E1-86A9DEC1513A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>543c2e6f1517b8.29087441</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Energy,Environment,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Course material for light scattering teaching</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>23EF1218-F93D-45D3-8655-A5DB85F2A611</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Development of teaching for light scattering, particularly on the 3D-PCS equipment at the University of Leeds</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d5c871a78c16.85108111</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>A 3D-Photon correlation spectrometer has been installed in the School of Physics &amp;amp; Astronomy in Leeds.
