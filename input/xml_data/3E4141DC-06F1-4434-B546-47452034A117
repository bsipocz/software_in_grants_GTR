Indeed, the education system potentially represents the single most effective agent of social change with the capacity to bridge ethnic division in conflict affected countries (Petroska-Beska &amp;amp; Najcevska, 2004). In Northern Ireland (NI), the education system is distinguishable by the degree of separation that exists between Catholic and Protestant faith communities. Currently, 93% of pupils attend predominately 'own' religion schools. Similarly, following the dissolution of Yugoslavia, wider ethnic divisions are now reflected in separate education systems in the Republic of Macedonia (Macedonia), Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), and Croatia. In post-conflict societies, these divisions can contribute to social fragmentation and inhibit the development of a 'shared society'.

In 2007 an innovative approach to facilitate reconciliation through schools separated on ethnic or religious lines was developed in NI. Informed by intergroup contact theory (Allport, 1954), shared education aims to break down boundaries between separate schools by providing sustained, curriculum-based engagement between pupils. A corpus of research demonstrates the effectiveness of the programme in promoting harmonious intergroup relations. Shared education has received significant political support in NI, and from 2015, is being extended across the region via a Signature Programme coordinated by the Department of Education. Outside NI, shared education is being implemented in Israel and Macedonia and the model has attracted interest from academics and policymakers in other divided contexts, including South Africa, BiH and Croatia, although to date it has not been instigated in these countries. 

In view of the increasing internationalisation of the shared education model, we propose the creation of a strategic network across four jurisdictions (NI, Macedonia, BiH, and Croatia) of academics, practitioners, NGOs, and policymakers whose work contributes to peace building through the promotion of intergroup contact and intercultural dialogue in education, with a view to facilitate, promote, and develop models of shared education for each jurisdiction. The project employs a multi-stage design, beginning with a knowledge exchange seminar in NI providing network members an opportunity to learn more about the model and to see the implementation of the programme in NI schools. Further, it will facilitate initial thinking on the implications of shared education for partner countries, particularly regarding structural changes needed to facilitate programme implementation. This will be followed by a series of in-country knowledge exchange seminars in the participant States and capacity building activities to develop and support the implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of shared education programmes; including, but not limited to, professional development for teachers and practitioners, workshops on developing and enhancing research skills key to programme evaluation, and on using research findings to advocate for policy change. 

The knowledge generated from these phases will inform the development of a research agenda to move forward shared education initiatives in each country, the establishment of a shared education advocacy group to advocate for policy change, and proposals to pursue pilot programmes in BiH and Croatia. Additionally, a comprehensive comparative research and evaluation programme will be developed to examine the impact of shared education in different educational and societal contexts, with a view to refining the model and developing best practice nationally and internationally. Ultimately, building the capacity of key stakeholders to develop and initiate shared education has the capability of fostering more harmonious intergroup relations to transmute the social landscape of participant societies.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In regions emerging from violence, systems of separate education for different ethno-religious groups are common and can have a detrimental effect on social attitudes, perpetuating division and therein threatening social cohesion. In Northern Ireland (NI), an innovative model of 'shared education' offers an effective mechanism to facilitate engagement between pupils, reducing prejudice and promoting more harmonious intergroup relations. Interest in the model has spread, with initiatives at differing stages of development in the Republic of Macedonia (Macedonia), Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), and Croatia. This project will create a strategic alliance of academics, practitioners, NGOs, and policymakers within each jurisdiction. We will:

1. Establish a network to capitalise on the expertise within and between each jurisdiction and facilitate engagement between academics and other educational stakeholders (the policy community, teachers, practitioners etc.) that can help create the environment for initiating shared education (BiH, Croatia); and where initiatives have been developed (Macedonia) consider, through the network, how they can best be supported and extended.
2. Identify areas where capacity building events will be conducted to support and develop skills needed to effectively implement, monitor, and evaluate the shared education programme. For example, we will organise training and workshops which will help researchers in the partnering countries to develop the skills needed to undertake research on educational interventions. We will also share knowledge about how Shared Education has operated and been evaluated in NI and, to a lesser extent Macedonia, and identify the challenges involved in developing and researching interventions in BiH and Croatia. This exchange of knowledge and skills will ensure that researchers in each jurisdiction are better equipped to undertake research on educational initiatives that promote peace in post conflict societies. 
3. Support the establishment of advocacy groups to promote the shared education model to policymakers and government officials. The PI was a founding member of such a group in NI which has proven effective at engaging with policymakers and government officials in a meaningful way. Sharing experiences from this context will help to support similar approaches in the other jurisdictions, with the ultimate goal of influencing policy and decision making across the Balkan region. 
4. Host a project website which will highlight how the strategic network ultimately constructs a powerful framework for delivering and researching shared education, as well as shaping education policy on the problem of separation. Links to the website will be placed on various social media platforms. The promotion of the network and its activities to a wider audience offers the possibility of forming new alliances with partners within each jurisdiction, as well as forging connections with partners in countries outside of the current network; therefore extending the use of the shared education model to other historically divided societies, across the Balkan region and beyond.
5. Publish a policy-oriented final report outlining the potential for shared education in each of the regions that will be disseminated via the website and directly sent to a wide range of stakeholders (teachers, school leaders, and policy makers) within each jurisdiction. A link will also be made to the online UNESCO Chair platform, hosted by UNESCO via Hughes.
6. Develop a research agenda to address the global challenge of education in divided societies, including pilot programmes for shared education activities in BiH and Croatia, and a programme of research to undertake a comprehensive comparative research and evaluation programme to examine the impact of shared education in different educational and societal contexts, with a view to refining the model and developing best practice nationally and international</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-07-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-01-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>150316</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/P006655/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F9D6F76D-4C6C-4E36-8E06-D471DED87098</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>56C9394E-9F52-4433-9619-6A14493473A8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>D640D1B8-B141-4DFC-BCD3-CEADD848A918</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>GCRF</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
