The Earth's climate is changing: temperatures are rising and freak weather events, such as floods, droughts and heat waves, are becoming more frequent. These changing weather patterns are influencing the spread and severity of many infectious diseases. Pests that blight human crops are spreading polewards at an average rate of two miles a year and diseases of humans are also shifting: dengue outbreaks occur in the USA, and the UK climate is predicted to be suitable for malaria by 2050. 

Many of these diseases are occur in epidemics - devastating outbreaks that eventually wane, only to occur again in the future. Epidemics are known to drive evolution in natural host populations: individuals that are susceptible to the infectious parasites are eliminated, leaving behind a more resistant population. However, evolution in the host population can drive counter-evolution in the epidemic-causing parasite population: as the susceptible individuals are eliminated, the parasites that are able to infect the more resistant individuals are favoured by natural selection. This is coevolution. Coevolution is not just driven by epidemics; epidemics are also driven by coevolution. This is because the rate and nature of coevolution determines the genetic makeup of both host and parasite populations, and diseases spread much more slowly, i.e., epidemics are smaller, when host populations are genetically diverse. 

Climate change is causing fluctuations in parasite transmission between hosts, often leading to more frequent and severe epidemics. But how do current epidemics influence those of the future? Do warmer temperatures, and the large epidemics that follow, lead to smaller or larger epidemics in the long-term? We currently do not know the answer to this; my proposal seeks to change that.

I will test how ambient temperatures and mixing of hosts and parasites (which often happens as a result of freak weather events such as flooding) influences both coevolution and epidemic severity. What is more, I will do this both in the wild - the natural arena of host-parasite interactions - and in artificial outdoor ponds where the temperature can be experimentally manipulated. In the laboratory, I will also quantify how parasite adaptation to the current host population affects its infectivity and growth on future populations (the offspring of the current hosts). I will examine how epidemics in the first year drive epidemic size and severity in subsequent years. This will allow me to generate models that can predict the severity of future disease outbreaks based on past epidemic information. Ultimately, my aim is to develop tools that better predict the likelihood and severity of disease epidemics in an increasingly variable world.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research?
Worldwide, over 50% of deaths in children under five years old are caused by infectious disease, and plant diseases cause crop losses that amount to 12% of global annual productivity. Our changing climate is also causing shifts in patterns of disease over space and time: West Nile Virus is increasingly common in the USA, and the ranges of crop diseases are moving polewards at an average rate of two miles per year. This research is therefore of wide interest to academic and non-academic sectors.
Findings from this research will be promoted to: academic biologists/agriculturists; educational charities; and to the general public.

How will they benefit from this research?

My research will be disseminated in multiple formats to ensure it is visible to the widest possible audience. It will play a role in:
(1) Driving the academic field of evo-epidemiology.
(2) Helping those in agriculture and aquaculture protect against disease.
(3) Engaging the general public in the scientific process.
(4) Educating students of varying ages in how climate factors can affect disease evolution.
(5) Equipping young scientists with the skills to do good science and to promote that science to audiences beyond academia.

My research asks cutting-edge questions regarding how ecological and evolutionary processes interact to affect disease severity over time. It will therefore fuel further productive research by the academic community. To maximise its influence, this research will be published in high-impact journal publications, which will be freely accessible to academics worldwide (either directly through Open Access journals or via the University of Stirling's online research repository, STORRE); it will also be presented at both national and international academic conferences. 
Project findings (in particular those from theme 3) will be used to help those in agriculture and aquaculture predict and manage disease epidemics in their crops/stocks from year to year, aiding in long-term disease management and improving the efficiency of food production.

My research will also be actively promoted to the general public through blog posts and short videos explaining up-to-date findings as they are published; findings will also be promoted using social media and to the conventional media via press releases (from the University of Stirling's Media Relations Office, after consultation with NERC). This will generate a public following of the project. Further, science from this project will be used to make a short film for national television (in collaboration with BAFTA award-winning cinematographer, Alan McLaughlic); it will therefore be transmitted into the homes of people throughout the UK and will have direct cultural impact.
Project findings will play a key role in teaching the principles of evolution and how climate change could affect the severity and spread of disease to students of various ages throughout the world. The National Center for Science Education (a US-based charity) has been involved with the designing of this project, and the project's findings form a key component of freely-available interactive learning resource to teach the principles of evolution and climate change. A key aim is to get students to consider how a changing climate could affect disease evolution and severity. It is therefore of considerable educational worth.

Finally, staff and bursary students will acquire important professional skills that are relevant within and outside academia. The technician will acquire new laboratory skills that should help them progress to other fulfilling employment at the end of the contract. The bursary students will be taught numerous scientific skills; they will also be trained in communicating science verbally and in written form (blogs posts journal publications) form to a wide range of audiences. These are invaluable skills.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-06-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-06-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>462976</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Voyage to Galapagos</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>33A8B136-4112-4EC2-9B67-50DDB93FD499</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The project's findings will be used as a basis for online student-led learning resources - essentially interactive games where the student (school, university or graduate level) navigates through the game to collect data, test hypothesis and understand the evolutionary and epidemiological processes that drive disease severity and spread.
