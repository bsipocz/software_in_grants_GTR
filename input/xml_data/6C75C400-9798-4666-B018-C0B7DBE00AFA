In this disease, white blood cells, which are part of the immune system and usually defend the body against infection, accumulate in the glomeruli where they &amp;quot;stick&amp;quot; to the walls of the capillaries and become inappropriately activated, releasing chemicals which cause inflammation and damage to these filtering units, causing kidney dysfunction. GN is a common cause of dialysis-dependent kidney failure, which is associated with long-term health problems and increased mortality. Crescentic GN (CrGN) is a particularly severe form of inflammation in the glomeruli which is potentially life-threatening and, untreated, leads to rapidly progressive kidney failure.

GN is currently treated using powerful drugs that suppress the entire immune system, rather than therapy targeted specifically at the disease itself, because the mechanisms by which circulating white blood cells are recruited to and retained in the glomeruli are not well understood. These drugs are not always effective and can cause severe side effects because the immune system is needed to protect the body against infection and cancer. The goal of this research is to understand the mechanisms by which circulating white blood cells are recruited to the glomerulus to cause inflammation and kidney failure so that more targeted, safer therapy can be developed.

I will study the mechanisms by which white blood cells &amp;quot;stick&amp;quot; to the glomerular capillary walls and cause inflammation and damage using a technique called intravital microscopy to directly visualise (using a high-powered microscope) their trafficking and behaviour as they travel through the glomerular capillaries in a rat model of CrGN. I will examine the hypothesis that different subpopulations of white blood cells are recruited to particular areas of the glomerulus during the disease process and that this is important in causing the glomerular damage that leads to progressive kidney failure. I will study the mechanisms that recruit these cells to the glomerulus and cause them to be retained there and, importantly, I will study their fate to determine whether they can be detected in urine, which may represent a useful clinical tool to assess disease activity in response to treatment. 

Importantly, I will use a more clinically relevant model of CrGN than has been previously described to carry out this work. The rat is biologically similar to humans, and experimental CrGN in the WKY rat strain produces changes in the kidney that look strikingly similar to those seen in human CrGN. This is an established model of CrGN which has been used successfully by our research group for decades to study the disease. I will be using the newer but increasingly popular technique of &amp;quot;intravital microscopy&amp;quot; to study the trafficking of white blood cells in &amp;quot;real time&amp;quot; as they travel through the glomeruli of rats that are alive but under general anaesthetic and therefore not in any distress. This much more closely resembles the environment of the human kidney and is therefore more translatable to human disease than other experimental techniques studying the behaviour and function of white blood cells in cell culture systems outside the body (&amp;quot;in vitro&amp;quot; studies). 

I will undertake the proposed research at Imperial College (IC) where scientists in the kidney unit have an excellent track-record conducting high quality research in the field of GN. Through collaborative work with Prof Aitman's genetics group at IC, our research group has identified a number of genes responsible for susceptibility to CrGN and have developed strains of rats which lack these responsible genes. This will provide me with the tools needed to study mechanisms of white blood cell recruitment and retention in the glomerulus in more detail than has been previously possible in rat models of CrGN.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The proposed project will use intravital microscopy in a clinically relevant rat model of crescentic glomerulonephritis (CrGN) to study the mechanisms by which leukocytes are recruited to and retained within the glomerulus, through direct visualisation of leukocyte-endothelial interactions in the intact glomerulus in vivo. I will study for the first time the role of leukocyte recruitment in crescent formation and examine the hypothesis that specific subpopulations of blood leukocytes are recruited to discrete areas within the glomeruli, contributing to disease pathogenesis. Importantly, I will investigate the fate of these leukocytes, which may identify clinically useful urinary biomarkers in CrGN.

I will use nephrotoxic nephritis (NTN) in the rat as an animal model of CrGN as this model has been extensively characterised genetically and has a histopathological phenotype that closely resembles immune-mediated CrGN in humans. I will use an established WKY rEF1alphaGFP/+ rat to create rEF1alphaGFP+/--WKY rat bone marrow chimeras (&amp;quot;leukocyte reporters&amp;quot;). This will distinguish circulating leukocytes (GFP+) from tissue resident dendritic cells and macrophages. I will use a model of unilateral hydronephrosis to superficialise the glomeruli within the kidney and permit intravital imaging using confocal microscopy. I will study leukocyte trafficking through the glomeruli in steady state and after induction of NTN. Time permitting, I will analyse the urine of rEF1alphaGFP+/--WKY leukocyte reporter rats with NTN using flow cytometry to determine whether GFP+ leukocytes recruited to the glomerulus have a urinary fate.

CrGN is an important cause of renal failure and current treatment with generalised immunosuppression is associated with significant morbidity. This work will advance our understanding of the mechanisms of leukocyte recruitment and their role in the pathogenesis of CrGN, facilitating future identification of more targeted therapy.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research will have a number of societal and economic impacts both the medium and long-term.

In the medium term, our proposed work on studying the urinary fate of circulating leukocytes recruited to the glomerulus in experimental crescentic glomerulonephritis (CrGN) may have a significant impact for clinical nephrologists, hospital diagnostic services and patients with GN. This work will determine whether analysis of urine for leukocyte cell surface markers would be a potentially useful clinical tool in assessing disease activity in experimental CrGN. This may represent a useful clinical tool in the future to predict disease relapse in GN and could be optimised for translation into clinical practice where it would represent a useful advancement in the clinical tools available to monitor relapse in patients with GN. The work has economic implications as earlier detection of relapse in GN and prompt treatment may reduce the risk of progression to irreversible end-stage renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT), which carries significant long-term costs for the NHS. GN is responsible for 19% of cases of end-stage renal failure (UK Renal Registry 2012 data), and the required RRT for these patients costs the NHS approximately &amp;pound;202 million per year.

In the long-term an improved understanding of the mechanisms of glomerular injury and dysfunction in GN with a view to identifying novel therapeutic targets that specifically target the disease process itself will be of great interest to patients with this disease and their families. GN is a major cause of end stage renal failure and current treatment strategies using generalised immunosuppression, which can result in significant morbidity and mortality, are suboptimal. Therefore a substantial proportion of the renal patient community stand to benefit from research aimed at improving the understanding of this disease in order to improve medical therapies and patient outcomes.

The proposed prject is an example of high quality basic science research that involves the use of animal models with the long-term translational goal of improving the clinical care of patients with GN. As such, our work will have a role in public engagement. For example, communicating our research findings and the rationale for the use of animal models to young scientists at schools and universities will help improve their understanding of what basic science research can achieve and how using animals in medical research can translate into improved clinical care and patient outcomes.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-04-16</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-03-09</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>278484</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6F856F21-C16D-4D8B-A876-7C2E5C08907B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Effects of dyslipidaemia on monocyte production and function in cardiovascular disease.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nature reviews.
