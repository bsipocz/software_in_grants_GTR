Symptoms include numbness, tingling, pain in the fingers, and weakness of the thumb - it can therefore be a very disabling condition for patients. It is estimated that between 5-10% of people in the UK suffer from CTS. Tens of thousands of carpal tunnel release operations are performed in the UK each year, but there are risks of complications from this operation, and many patients do not improve, or get recurrent symptoms. 

It is not known why some people develop CTS while others do not. Some people appear to be genetically predisposed to developing CTS, but there are also occupational and lifestyle factors that increase the risk of developing the condition. CTS is also more common in people who have certain diseases such as diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis. We therefore hypothesize that CTS is a so-called complex disease, where several genetic and environmental factors interact to cause the disease, rather than a single gene being responsible. 

The current best method for detecting and locating regions within the genome predisposing to a complex disease is a genome-wide association study (GWAS). In a GWAS, markers across the whole genome are typed in a large number of cases and controls in order to determine which genetic variants are statistically more likely to be associated with having the disease. This part of the study will be undertaken in Prof Dominic Furniss's lab at the Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Science at the University of Oxford. We will use genetic data from UK Biobank, which has recruited 500,000 people from across the UK. Each participant has provided a detailed medical history, provided samples of their DNA, and allowed linkage of data with their medical records. We will compare the genetic markers between a subset of patients on this database known to have CTS, and compare them with a larger group of controls without CTS in order to locate genetic variants associated with CTS.

The second part of the study will be carried out in Prof David Bennett's lab at the Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, also at the University of Oxford. Here, we will perform functional studies in order to understand how the genetic variants identified in the GWAS affect proteins and cells in CTS. This will be achieved by using DNA and tissue samples from a group of patients with CTS who have been recruited by Prof Bennett's group. By undertaking molecular genetic studies on these samples, we aim to identify genes that may contribute to patients developing CTS.

Our overall aim is to understand the genetic basis of CTS. This will help us to understand what causes CTS, and lead to the development of new treatments in the future, reducing the need for, and recurrence after surgery.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The aim of this study is to understand the molecular genetic basis of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). The specific aims of the research are divided into overlapping themes of genetic analysis and functional characterisation: 

Theme 1 - Genetics (Months 1-16)

Genotypes generated by UK Biobank will be used to compare CTS cases with controls. We estimate that there will be approximately 7500 cases following quality control, and the control group will be matched using age and gender, outnumbering the cases 10:1. Analysis will be conducted mainly using PLINK and R. Fine-mapping of the associated loci will be performed using imputed data released from UK Biobank, expected in early 2016. 

Theme 2 - Functional Characterisation (Months 17-32)

By the end of 2015, the Bennett Group will have developed a cohort of &amp;gt;150 patients with electrophysiologically and clinically diagnosed CTS, and age- and gender-matched controls, with detailed phenotypic information including electrophysiology, skin biopsies from the median nerve distribution, DNA and RNA samples. Patients recruited from late 2014 onwards will also undergo 7T MRI imaging of the carpal tunnel, and biopsies from fibrotic synovial tissue will be taken during decompression surgery.

Functional studies will be driven by the results of the genetic analysis. First, the entire CTS cohort will be genotyped using Sequenom MassArray at all associated SNPs identified in the GWAS, and genotype will be correlated with clinical phenotype. A thorough analysis of the potentially most functionally interesting variants will then be undertaken, and the location of these variants will be analysed in relation to genes of interest.

CTS-patient derived tissues will be used to determine the effects of variants on RNA and protein expression. If there is evidence for a functional effect of a variant on a particular gene in CTS-derived cells, gene knockdown or over-expression will be used to affect the function of this gene.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The most direct beneficiaries of this work will be academic researchers who are also investigating the molecular basis of compression neuropathy, neuropathic pain, peripheral neuropathy and nerve injury. There is much interest in these problems worldwide, with over 5,800 active clinical trials listed in the clinicaltrials.gov database.

Clinicians who treat carpal tunnel syndrome and related compressive neuropathies, including plastic surgeons, orthopaedic surgeons, neurosurgeons, neurologists, rheumatologists, and general practitioners will benefit from improved understanding of the process of peripheral compressive neuropathy. Patients will also benefit from a better definition of the cause of their problem, and this may have a direct benefit in terms of improved prognostication, and potentially tailored treatment in the era of personalised medicine. 

The Nation's Health will benefit from this research project, though the benefits will be over a longer time period and will be less tangible. By improving knowledge of the causes of carpal tunnel syndrome, this work will potentially lead to better molecular diagnostics, and more accurate sub-classification of the syndrome. This knowledge can be correlated with surgical outcomes, and might mandate a change in surgical or non-surgical management approach, leading to more efficient use of resources. Furthermore, it is conceivable that links between genetic predisposition and environmental exposures will be established. This might lead to effective primary prevention trials aimed at reducing the incidence of carpal tunnel syndrome.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>199709</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/N001524/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>041997EB-CFD8-493D-B0F8-DFA35451D0BE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Neurological</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
