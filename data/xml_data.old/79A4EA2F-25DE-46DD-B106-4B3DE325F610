Both visions have traction in South Africa. Urban living has offered opportunities for some to better their economic standing, strengthen capabilities and expand freedoms. However, given the pace of urbanisation and problematic urban governance, urban areas remain spaces of inequality, degradation, crisis and conflict. This is particularly true for those on the margins, whose lives are profoundly shaped by the need to negotiate security and justice. The welfare of urban Others and their long-term prospects for socioeconomic development are intimately bound up in the outcomes of these negotiations, as recent waves of xenophobic violence demonstrate. 

Positive urban transformation requires understanding how multiple marginalities interact in urban areas. At present, this intersection has been neglected. This South Africa-UK Partnership forges an international academic network to build capacities to rigorously and innovatively address this issue. Our ambitious agenda focuses primarily on (internal and external) migrants and lesbian-gay-bi-trans-queer (LGBTQ) communities. Although the freedom to embrace diversity and difference is at the heart of a democratic city, these urban Others face the stresses of everyday prejudice and spectre of severe violence, like xenophobic riots or acts of 'corrective rape'. Security threats facing migrants and LGBTQ people are comparable, but the logics animating them are distinct, making them conducive to comparison.
 
Our Partnership will strengthen capacities in South Africa to explore strategies individuals use to negotiate these varied marginalities, embedded in wider economic, social and political systems. It will also particularly build skills to explore roles that digital technologies play in this process, shaping flows of power, resources, and information in urban areas; and how policymakers and civil society groups are responding to complex challenges of urban wellbeing. 
 
The Partnership develops skills, knowledge, and networks, supporting cutting edge research that actively engages communities, civil society groups and government agencies. We will identify research synergies; provide methods training in Big Data, Social Network Analysis, Remote Event Mapping, and Visual Methods to push the boundaries of urban research; fund 'urban lab' pilot projects to encourage innovative methods and questions; organise visiting fellowships to provide time and space for meaningful collaboration; and provide impact training to ensure that our timely interdisciplinary research agenda has effective and wide-reaching influence.

ODA statement: The primary purpose of this project is to promote the welfare and development of the partner country. It will do this in three primary ways. First, the topic of the collaborative research is crucially important for South Africa, where rapid urbanisation, entrenched inequities and uneven development risk positive urban transformation, especially in relation to vulnerable groups such as migrants or LGBTQ communities. Secondly, we will address these key concerns through drawing on the comparative and complementary strengths of our two partners, Wits University's strengths in detailed local historical, ethnographic and qualitative research and generating impact in South African policy networks and Edinburgh's strength in methods, especially interdisciplinary approaches. Thirdly, the project will draw on Edinburgh's expertise in quantitative methods and data science, and the project is designed to build the research capacity of Wits University researchers in new approaches and generate future collaborative research.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We have identified several beneficiaries who will gain from this project. These are DfID, South African civil society groups, and the South African government at a local, provincial and national level.

1. Government 
The knowledge generated in this project will greatly benefit the strategic aims and missions of several national government departments. For example, the Department of Social Development's strategic aim to 'reduce deprivation and protect poor and vulnerable members of our society by expanding its social assistance and social welfare services' will be greatly aided by a more incisive analysis of everyday lives on the urban margins. Likewise the Department of Health will be better able to appreciate health risks and service uptake amongst vulnerable populations to aid in their mission to provide 'access, equity, efficiency, quality and sustainability' of healthcare, and the Department of Labour will have a clearer idea of the challenges complicating their mission to provide 'social and income protection'.
The research agenda also helps inform the creation of new Integrated Development Plans at a municipal level in 2017. Understanding the security risks and strategies of vulnerable populations in peri-urban areas is crucial if IDPs are going to help build 'sustainable human settlements and viable communities, improve all public services... and fight poverty'.
Finally, our work will benefit portfolio committees, working groups, and departments who focus directly on the marginal populations groups that we study, such as Department of Justice and Constitutional Development through their National Action Plan on Racism and Xenophobia, the Portfolio Committee on Home Affairs, the Technical Working Group on Migration, Mobility and HIV, and - at a local level - institutions like the City of Johannesburg's Migration Unit. Key stakeholders from these groups will be involved in the project's advisory panel, sharing their research needs, learning the findings of our 'urban labs' as our research agenda evolves. 

2. Civil Society 
South Africa has a rich civil society with key groups committed to providing protection and support to migrants and sexual minorities. Adopting the principles and priorities of the MoVE research approach at ACMS by blending social action and research, our research network would seek to engage civil society at all stages of our research: Placing key stakeholders on our advisory panel; collaborating with organisations and individuals in the shaping of our research questions; providing training so that affected populations can act as research assistants or engage in auto-ethnography, and sharing the findings of our 'urban labs' projects with them.
In doing so we would help to empower, capacitate, and inform both individuals from the affected populations and groups working with the LGBTQ community - Lesbian and Gay Equality Project, Out, Gender Dynamix, The Triangle Project - and groups working with the migrant community - Consortium for Refugees and Migrants in South Africa (CoRMSA), the Johannesburg Migrant Health Forum, SANGOCO, SA Red Cross, Gift of the Givers, Abahlali baseMjondolo, South African Council of Churches. Groups working specifically with migrant sex workers - the Sex Worker Education and Advocacy Taskforce (SWEAT) and Sisonke, the national sex movement - will also be included.

3. Department of International Development 
Understanding insecurities faced by urban Others and the spaces and strategies they utilise to negotiate their security, is central to our understanding of vulnerability and resilience. DfID's increasing attention to 'resilience' stems from their realisation that by cultivating resilience they can move towards their vision of 'a world that is healthier, more stable and increasingly prosperous'. New research methods and evidence will help DfID to engage with lives on the margins, strengthening initiatives to improve wellbeing.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-11-12</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-11-13</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>113515</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Going Global Conference</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>47908DE6-6552-4536-BD03-75FDBE4D898D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In May 2016, Jo Vearey and Barbara Bompani represented the SeaM project at the Going Global conference.

On 10-11 November 2016, SeaM members explored emerging audio-visual methods at the #artsmethods 3 symposium at the Workers' Museum in Johannesburg. On 30th November 2016, a workshop on small-scale and artisanal mining at the Workers' Museum also help to showcase and develop the insights developing from the SeaM project - Work and Well-being on the Urban Periphery.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>707FE841-FC39-4E17-8CD0-621E19B0B0F4</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d340564847f0.09792703</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Security and Diplomacy,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1. Development One: Research Methods Workshop

Our welcoming reception featured 'Queer Crossings' - a visual arts and narrative writing project engaging with LGBTIQ asylum seekers and migrants in Johannesburg - will be on display throughout the reception. This launch attracted a great deal of attention from across the university and helped to publicise the work of the SeaM collaboration.During the workshop, sessions were hosted by Graham Crow and Fiona Philippi on interdisciplinary collaboration; Jo Vearey and Elsa Olivera on the ethics and possibilities of audio-visual methods; Mark Wong on twitter stream analysis; Sam Spiegel on counter-mapping; Gil Viry on social network analysis; Alison Koslowski and Jan Eichhorn on surveys; Angus Bancroft on digital sociology. These sessions were interspersed with poster sessions that allowed for 'research speed dating' so that team members could identify potential synergies and collaborations for the pilot project funding. The workshop finished with a hot-housing session, aimed at allowing potential collaborators to develop project ideas and map out when in the scheme's timeline they would like to apply for funding. The innovative and original projects that emerged from this hot-housing session are testament to the success of the workshop and the depth of the synergies between the Wits and Edinburgh team. 

Discoveries: We have discovered research synergies at the workshop that we held in Edinburgh between the 17th and 19th of February 2016. These potentially provide new insights into Security at the Margins in peri-urban South Africa, which will be extended through upcoming pilot projects. The workshop was attended by 13 South African academics and 15 Edinburgh academics. 

2. Development Two: Pilot Project on Work and Well-being on the Urban Periphery: Artisanal Mining in Johannesburg

Start Date: March 2016 - End Date: March 2017 - Funding Awarded: &amp;pound;9,500

This project analyses the living and working conditions of peripheral informal and peri-urban mining communities, which contain substantial numbers of migrant workers. It seeks to understand how innovative participatory visual methods can be used alongside traditional empirical approaches to health and social science to better understand the negotiation of economic and physical security. 

The project brings together: Dr. Zaheera Jinnah, Assoc.Prof. Jo Vearey, Thea de Gruchy and Goitse Manthata, doctoral candidate from Wits. Dr. Samuel Spiegel and Jessica Yu, doctoral candidate from Edinburgh. Project partners include: Statistics South Africa (STATS SA) Consortium for Refugees and Migrants in South Africa (CoRMSA) Sonke Gender Justice South African Cities Network Centre for Applied Legal Studies (CALS) at Wits University Global Health Research Program at University of British Columbia Partnership Africa, Ottawa Department of Health, SA

Discoveries: An Ethnography Of Informal Artisanal Gold Mining in Johannesburg. Our researchers reported three key findings: first that ASM is an important- but highly risky- livelihood strategy of the urban poor, especially cross-border migrants, and is wrought with legal and social restrictions that further compound the dangers that miners face in their work. Second that there are significant health, safety and well being related outcomes and conditions associated with ASM that are poorly understood. In particular the rise of informal settlements in mining communities, the lack of adequate protection to workers in the sector, the criminalisation of ASM and the disregard of environmental rehabilitation of mines collude to create a risky and dangerous environment for those living and working in and around the sector. Third, ASM is rooted in long held beliefs and rituals that bring into question the ownership of natural resources, the structure of work teams and the organisation of labour. This anthropological aspect of ASM is poorly understood in the popular and academic discourse.

2. Development Three: Pilot Project on constructing difference in and on the margins of apartheid cities 

Start Date: July 2016 - Proposed End Date: May 2017 - Funding Awarded: &amp;pound;4,568

Studies of 'xenophobia and xenophobic violence' have focused largely on dichotomous relations between migrants and citizens, with a large emphasis on how migrants are victimised at the hands of host &amp;quot;communities&amp;quot;. The immigration discourse in South Africa, like in many parts of the world, tends to treat immigrants as objects of inquiry with very little done to explore how the difference within and between migrants and citizens is constructed and negotiated in everyday life. It is against this backdrop that this research project seeks to look at the ways in which difference is constructed, deconstructed and negotiated more broadly in everyday life amongst South Africa's urban citadins. The aim of the project is to understand how difference, in particular, is constructed along multiple lines of class, race and gender, and how these intersect, within the context of what has been termed 'xenophobic violence'. The study will highlight the significance of multiple positionalities in the construction of difference and how this can help in understanding the dynamics of xenophobia and xenophobic violence in the country. The project seeks to answer the following core questions: What and how is difference constructed? Who sets the terms of difference? What is the role of boundaries in the construction of difference? What is the role of space in the construction of difference?</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We will be building on these synergistic insights over the course of the next two years through our pilot projects schemes. The findings will also be relayed to our advisory panel, allowing the findings to be built on by both an academic and a practice-based community.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>78E69595-FE35-4F5B-A4CB-9E99B53C4092</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d340384745b3.17253732</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Security and Diplomacy,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://theseamproject.wordpress.com/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N009940/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DB058E35-DBAD-4B21-B030-5C3C78825B11</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Area Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>69128365-74B2-4A08-8067-57863ECCB013</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>African Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3367A4B0-EBD4-4FD9-8351-3A2F206BD2AF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Anthropology and Development</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>78369800-A95E-49BC-94E7-8659E5C2EFEF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Geography and Development</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5BAFFA07-4055-4FE0-BE2D-FF47ECC4B6BF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Politics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>C11BDEA9-7D9D-4728-B6A9-31032921B328</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Newton</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
