&lt;p>The research will investigate these issues from a variety of angles, incorporating relevant International Business (IB) and International Political Economy (IPE) theories and frameworks, and will be conducted as a three-stage process, with each step building on the previous one. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>The first stage will examine the nature of declining East Asian investment in the ASEAN and the investment decisions of foreign firms in the region by leveraging the concepts used in IPE and the insights from the field of IB, through desk-based research. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>The second stage will be based on quantitative methods and will draw on an extended IB theoretical framework in order to more comprehensively capture the explanatory factors that drive and/or inhibit FDI in countries within the ASEAN. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>Finally, the third stage will involve a firm-level study across different types of MNCs in selected ASEAN countries into the perception and effects of the relevant IB and IPE factors on the growth and activities of these firms in the region&amp;nbsp;- particularly with regard to the increasing importance of extremism and terrorism on the international business environments.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>50941</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The structure of trade, R&amp;D and innovation in east/southeast Asia</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5B2DDCE9-CF9D-45E2-B29B-B1DF0F3A18F9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This lecture was presented as a guest lecture to the second year undergraduate students enrolled in the Fundamentals in International Business module, at the Manchester Metropolitan University Business School. The lecture drew on my research on international business practices in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations region, as part of my fellowship. The lecture stimulated questions afterwards.

One student was very motivated by the lecture and requested that I supervise her undergraduate dissertation. The lecture also inspired her to pursue further study (at the Masters and PhD levels) in international politics.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-8064141644.2246562b114520</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Accenture and international business</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C659475F-4057-40D6-802F-F8C8F0FCE8BD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This lecture was presented as a guest lecture for the International Business and Management module, to MSc in International Business Management students. The lecture leveraged my experience working for Accenture as a manager and set their activities in mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;amp;A) in the context of the main theoretical frameworks of the field of international business, which I have been engaging with through the research for my fellowship. The lecture stimulated discussion on the cost and benefits of M&amp;amp;A activities and further questions about my experiences working for Accenture.

Student feedback on the lecture was very positive, particularly as it provided a personal, 'real world' example which they could learn from.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-6507808404.516252b114818</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The findings of the published paper were cited in Heron, T.

On a broader level, the research conducted during the Fellowship also contributed to a policy briefing for the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, in order to inform policy on FDI in a sub-Saharan African regional context: T&amp;uuml;selmann, H. and Buzdugan, S.R.

This research introduced the concept of 'regionalism from without' to the literature in order to explain the emergence of regional integration amongst 'developing' countries, in the context of their postcolonial relations with Europe. The research showed that under conditions of postcolonial asymmetries of power, integration may be initiated by states external to the region, which challenges established models that conceptualise integration as emerging from within the region. The research focused on the case of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) but showed that this concept of 'regionalism from without' explains the process of integration in a number of other regions in sub-Saharan Africa.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Relations between sub-Saharan African regions and donors, particularly the European Union (EU), have been problematic. The Economic Partnership Agreement negotiations between the EU and regions in sub-Saharan Africa have been especially fraught with difficulty. The analysis in the research may help policymakers from sub-Saharan African regions and donor countries promote a more autonomous form of regional integration in sub-Saharan Africa, from the 'ground up', in order to address more local issues of development.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>9118C702-774B-4523-A512-B8C681754E63</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54622a3b6a34f7.29153619</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Citation in Atlantic Future ( 3-year collaborative research project funded by the European Commission) working paper</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D4DD05A6-34A3-4BA4-AC14-7B6340638A41</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58b8041dad2f05.93277685</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.iai.it/sites/default/files/af_wp_26.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0A8F6A8F-8208-41EA-A5C8-4DCA761CBD6A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Regionalism from without: External involvement of the EU in regionalism in southern Africa</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Review of International Political Economy</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/eda1b19bf84735a77608ecbf22d01923"><gtr:id>eda1b19bf84735a77608ecbf22d01923</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Buzdugan S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cfb5fb5eef3b33</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9C26A9C6-1B41-417F-B707-90D9778B4BDD</gtr:id><gtr:title>The effects of government intervention on 'ownership' advantages and intra-regional FDI in the ASEAN</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d61760fad92dcd3e5426e885a4ab5d5b"><gtr:id>d61760fad92dcd3e5426e885a4ab5d5b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Stephen Buzdugan (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>m_989510204313c99d44</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">RES-073-27-0034</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-073-27-0034</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
