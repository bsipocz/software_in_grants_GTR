This
can be used to prevent data breaches such as ATM 'Skimming' attacks. Our project seeks to develop practical application
of QKD in securing short-range wireless communication between a terminal such as an ATM and a handheld device (e.g.
mobile phone). Our consortium, Nokia R&amp;amp;D UK Ltd., Alpha Contract Engineering (ACE) and University of Oxford have
identified the 3 main barriers to commercialisation, namely, the lack of low-cost optical wireless steering techniques, high
cost barrier to complex optical assembly for quantum receivers and the lack of mass-manufacturable single photon detector
(SPD) arrays on CMOS platform. A fast and precise optical steering device (University of Oxford) that directs single
photons from a handheld device to a quantum receiver will be developed. Testing of individual system components will be
carried out. In particular, miniaturised and simplified optical assemblies using existing UK manufacturing capability will be
researched, built and tested for QKD use (ACE). Critical parameters of SPD arrays on scalable CMOS platform will be
measured (University of Oxford) and used in detailed simulation and modelling to select the best suited steering method.
Finally, a prototype wireless quantum link will be built (Nokia &amp;amp; University of Oxford) with simplified optics (ACE) to
demonstrate the feasibility of secure quantum wireless transactions.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This feasibility study of optical steering techniques and miniaturised optics assembly for quantum technology will generate
numerous beneficiaries:
1. Ultra-high speed wireless research: use of beamsteering to direct light in free space is an attractive alternative to line-ofsight
RF wireless communication
2. Development of highly efficient, simple and low cost beamsteerers also has potential applications in photonic displays. as
well as imaging techniques used by security and defence. (e.g. directing light to switch between several low-light detection units)
3. Academic and industrial research: current wireless quantum communication systems have no tolerance in users' position.
The addition of a beamsteering system will significantly enhance their practicality and speed up commercial deployment.
4. Academic and industrial R&amp;amp;D labs in emerging quantum optics area: Miniaturised optics assemblies reduce system
footprint while maintaining low cost.
5. The general public: As a deliverable, a prototype will be built for demonstration. This will raise the awareness of quantum
technology to potential users.
6. Standardisation institutes: Our work will offer examples for practical case studies, as they are actively developing
standards for quantum encryption systems.
Scientific and economic competitiveness: Our project will increase the competitiveness of the UK in the quantum research
area. We will file UK-based IPs for the innovative ideas that are generated in this project. The future licensing fees
generated by this technology will benefit the UK economy. In addition, our project deliverable, the wireless quantum secure
system prototype, will be the first handheld quantum system with beamsteering capability. This invention will put UK in
media spot-light and recognition within the scientific field.
Quality of Life: Our project concerns data security. Wireless quantum security can be applied to day-to-day use such as (i)
To prevent ATM 'Skimming' attacks. Our project seeks to develop practical application of QKD in securing short-range
wireless communication between a terminal such as an ATM and a handheld device (e.g. mobile phone). (ii) Securing
sensitive financial data transmitted in mobile phone payments. In the futuristic case, it can even be used for (iii) Mobile
secure key storage. A mobile device capable of QKD can be used to exchange and store secret keys. Keys that are
exchanged by QKD is has future proof security. It can be used to secure any type of communication through classical
channels such as Wi-Fi. This would protect private information such as health data transmitted by mobile and wearable
devices (e.g. health fitness watches) that are bound to revolutionize healthcare in the near future with the rise of the
'Internet of Things'.
Timescales: Since the 1st commercial QKD system sold in 2001, the number of quantum technology companies has been
growing. As the technology is gaining wider acceptance (companies have planned to extend their commercial QKD network
to exceed 400 miles by 2015), our consortium expect handheld QKD devices to follow similar trend. We expect to have
some acceptance in 5-10 years' time, while aiming to have a much larger acceptance in 10-15 years' time. This time frame
will shorten as more wireless devices are developed to send sensitive financial and health data. This will drive the demand
of handheld quantum devices that are capable of unconditional data security.
Skills and Employment: This project will train highly skilled scientists and engineers with universal skills such as
programming, problem solving understanding in basic electronics, physics and importance of team work. In particular, the
project will give them specific skills in the area of photonics, quantum information and detection technologies. These skills
are in high demand across the employment sectors of software development, engineering and scientific publishing.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>123967</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>110000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>European Union (EU)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>LEIT space</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-05-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>European Commission</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>0146D7BD-A172-4B54-B336-2CCEB167B3DC</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d438b12ad425.91610615</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-06-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>We have demonstrated the beamsteering system at the national quantum showcase, and gained further funding to develop the system in collaboration with the York Led Quantum Hub.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>DC540E6A-D54F-46B6-BECC-3BA5A236497A</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d439453113e4.80732256</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software)</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have demonstrated a short-range optical link between two hand held devices.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Further development of the technology to make it smaller</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>7C343657-D6B5-4A86-8525-D2127EA46512</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d43b6300db28.94847401</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software)</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>DE3BEFBD-F212-4064-AEC0-B67359FB300A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Handheld free space quantum key distribution with dynamic motion compensation.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Optics express</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b4ac4f33d09104463e3c2efa0737f01d"><gtr:id>b4ac4f33d09104463e3c2efa0737f01d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Chun H</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1094-4087</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a7b05aae486c0.08515245</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/M508366/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
