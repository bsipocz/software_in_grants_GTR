In tandem, new machine learning techniques are being developed that harness this wealth of data to extract knowledge, make predictions, and generalize to unseen data; many of these with artificial neural networks at their core. This combination has led to impressive new solutions to numerous real world problems, including image classification and speech processing. 

Despite this progress, computers still lag behind human performance on more general-purpose tasks. In particular, current methods are not well suited to learning in non-stationary settings (where the data is changing over time): a desirable system would learn new things quickly, without forgetting what it knew before. To clarify these ideas, consider an artificial neural network trained to classify clothes from images. This is a non-stationary task, because fashions change and innovate, so the network must continually learn from new examples. However, it must do so without forgetting previous examples (e.g. summer clothes, not seen for all of winter), otherwise it would have to relearn about summer clothes from scratch each spring. In practice, to handle new examples, the network needs to learn at a high rate, but this high learning rate has the side-effect of overwriting old memories; that is, the system is forgetting quickly. Conversely, if the learning rate is low, the network remembers for much longer, but then learning is impractically slow, and no longer agile enough to deal with changing environments.

This research challenge of fast learning on non-stationary tasks without forgetting is therefore a fundamental one, and is recognized as a stumbling block in current approaches to transfer learning, continual learning or life-long learning. But of course, there exists one system that has solved the apparent dilemma: the human brain. We humans live our life in a non-stationary world, and we can both learn quickly and remember for a long time. A classical example from experimental psychology shows that the rate at which a person forgets a series of previously memorised random letters follows a power-law, i.e., the decay is equally large between 1h and 2h as it is between 2h and 4h, or between 1 week and 2 weeks. In contrast, forgetting in artificial systems happens exponentially, i.e., the decay is the same between 1h and 2h as it is between 100h and 101h, and therefore much faster than observed in humans.

In the brain, learning is based on the modification of the connection strength between neurons when a new pattern enters, a process called synaptic plasticity. This change can last for different amounts of time, giving rise to the three timescales: short-term plasticity, long-term plasticity and synaptic consolidation.

The research hypothesis of this proposal is that we can reach human-level performance by building a learning system that takes inspiration from these learning mechanisms of the brain, in particular the different time scales of synaptic plasticity and their interplay. The intuition is the following: an incoming memory is learnt quickly using the fastest learning rate, then this memory is slowly transferred to another component that operates at a slower learning rate, so that it is not overwritten by new incoming memories. 

This proposal therefore addresses two research challenges. I intend to build a unifying learning rule across all three learning timescales, just like I unified long-term and very long-term in past work. I will then investigate the learning and forgetting speed in plastic networks with the unifying learning rule. The network will learn to categorise on non-stationary data, but be tested on all the seen data, currently a very difficult task in machine learning.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>***Technological impact: This work will benefit current and future developers of smart technologies, since the learning rule developed for this project is likely to inspire new machine learning algorithms (see letter of support from the company Cortexica), new implementations in neuromorphic engineering, and new learning rules for intelligent robotics. In particular, I will use my industry collaboration with Tom Schaul at Google Deepmind, London, to ensure that my learning rule can refine their state-of-the-art deep learning networks, and be another stepping stone toward general-purpose artificial intelligence (see letter of support from Google Deepmind), as well as my industrial contact at Qualcomm - USA, Eugene Izhikevich, to ensure that my work flows into marketable neuromorphic chip design technology. 

***Health impact: On a longer timescale, this work will benefit people with diseases related to learning and memory such as Alzheimer's disease. It will also benefit people with diseases related to connectivity disorders such as autism and schizophrenia. Finally, it will benefit the growing ageing population in the UK and around the world, since this work will set a reference point for the amount of plasticity seen in the adults with natural or biased input statics. It has been shown that the synaptic turnover is increased in the aged brain, therefore my work can be a starting point for studying the behaviour and the impact of synaptic plasticity in an aged brain.

*** Providing tools for the experimental neuroscience community. My computational model will benefit the experimental neuroscience scientific community by providing models that can be used to test scientific hypotheses before performing any experiments; this will therefore reduce animal usage and provide novel tools to speed up science by increasing the number of possibilities that can be tested. To this end, I will publish my code on a standard database in the field (ModelDB) along with an easy-to-use graphical interface.

***Educational impact: I will train a new generation of scientists by training the staff in my laboratory and by teaching at summer schools. But more importantly, I will train a new generation of non-academic workers in the UK by through my computational neuroscience course in the Bioengineering Department at Imperial College London, teaching a solid skillset for working in pharmaceutical, biotechnological, or engineering companies such as high-tech companies using machine learning or robotics, but also in banks and insurances that use artificial neural network techniques.

***Public engagement: I aim to sensibilise the broader public to the discoveries of neuroscience and communicate the great scientific challenges of the future. To this end, I propose to work with the outreach manager of my Department to set up a number of activities, such as press releases after publication, maintenance of a webpage with breaking news, stands at two different outreach activities of Imperial College London (Imperial Festival and Imperial Fringe) as well as giving talks to prospective students during the open days of Imperial.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>98480</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>- The findings about the multiple time scales of plasticity have been used to influence machine learning rules at Google Research.
