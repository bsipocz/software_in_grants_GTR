Conventionally, multiple laser beams are required to laser cool and trap atoms and, with this, comes a corresponding overhead of optical components within a mechanical framework. An outcome is an increased risk of misalignment in the system due to environmental effects, such as vibrations. 

Laser cooling is not sufficient for the creation of a Bose-Einstein condensate, as it cannot reach temperatures below the microKelvin scale. Therefore, additional mechanisms, such as evaporative cooling are required. This necessitates the use of additional trapping potentials, which are formed through magnetic traps or far-off-resonant optical-dipole traps. 

Here, we propose an innovative approach of using only a single laser for both laser cooling and subsequent optical dipole trapping of atoms. We will initially use the Strathclyde-developed and previously qualified approach of a grating-MOT for creation of ultracold atoms, in which all the beams required for cooling and trapping are generated by a single beam reflected from a grating chip. A short (~1s) pre-cooling phase in a magnetic trap will be followed by a hybrid magnetic-optical trapping system, from which point there is a well-documented path for evaporative cooling. The rapid tuning of the MSquared Lasers-developed titanium-sapphire laser will enable the system to rapidly adapt to the needs of an dipole trap, with high power (&amp;gt;1W) and large detuning (~100nm) from atomic resonance. This approach will simplify the laser systems required for creation of a Bose-Einstein condensate, at the same time adding increased robustness and eliminating user input. In the project the partners will develop the required systems to rapidly re-lock the laser to the laser cooling transition after scanning the wavelength for the next cycle.
 
The techniques have wide relevance to quantum technologies as the form a core stage for atomic sensing devices including gravimeters, and inertial sensors. The project brings the academic excellence of the University of Strathclyde together with the industrial know-how of M Squared Lasers to exploit this world-leading innovation from the UK's research base. We will take it closer to commercialisation by commissioning a chip trap within an industrial environment, enhancing the technique and demonstrating measurement capability.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The potential disruptive nature of Quantum Technology has been recognised by the UK Government through its investment in the area announced in 2013. Through the ongoing translational work in e.g. atomic sensors and metrology it is becoming increasingly clear, that potential commercial devices will share a range of common components or build on shared platforms in areas such as laser sources, optical systems, vacuum technology and control electronics. 
Close integration of component development between highly specialised technology providers and academia provide the foundation for the translation of some of the research-based outcomes (e.g. from the Quantum Technology Hubs) to the industrial environment and early adopters. This is also a key component in the strategic development of the UK supply chain, that will ultimately form the basis for a new Quantum Technology industry. 
With the present proposal we seek to build on links with an industrial collaborator with unique expertise in laser technology and a history of developing products to market. While the technology will be developed specifically for laser cooling of Rb, and hence aimed at a substantial fraction of both the research market and the expected early commercial applications, it is a generic technology, that readily can be adapted to e.g. other alkali metal or alkaline earth systems. It is therefore anticipated that the impact of the work will extend beyond the immediate applications with significant potential for commercial exploitation to areas such as the basic research environment and space applications.
