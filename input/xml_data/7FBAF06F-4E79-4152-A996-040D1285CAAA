But what if the idea of learning about science hasn't crossed your radar? What if you've not had the opportunity/funds/time/inclination to go to your local university open lab event, or the latest science event at your local museum? This project targets the every-man/woman. It aims to bring local STFC-funded and STFC-related research to the local people on the streets of the UK, direct from the scientists. In doing so, it will achieve wider participation for public engagement of science. It will also promote the visibility and communication skills of female scientists who are active in UK-based STFC related research, helping boost their profiles and careers. Finally, it aims to make a real difference to the perception and role of women in science, by the public and government.

Soapbox Science is a fresh, no-frills grass-roots approach to bringing science to all people on the streets, especially those who wouldn't otherwise have come across science in their daily lives. Our Soapbox Scientists are real-life scientists, who are at the cutting-edge of scientific research in the UK. They stand on soapboxes on busy urban streets and talk to the passers by about their science. They transfer knowledge, answer the public's questions, and above all they share their thirst for science and their passion for being a scientist. Soapbox Science has no stuffy power-point presentations, no wordy exhibits, expensive constructs, or props. Moreover, there is no 'media-middleman' re-packaging the science to make it sensational and headline worthy. Soapbox Science is just good old-fashioned first-hand dialogue between the scientists and the public. Soapbox is not a new idea - in fact it's at least 200 years old. Its' format is inspired by 'Speaker's Corner' in London's Hyde Park, an historical arena for free speech and political reform for the people. Speaker's Corner revolutionised democracy and freedom of speech in oppressive Victorian Britain, and helped create the open democracy that our country enjoys today. As publicly funded scientists, we believe that the public has the right to hear about the exciting work they help fund through their taxes, and engage firsthand with the scientists who do it.

In the true spirit of London's Speakers' Corner, our motive behind Soapbox Science is not entirely apolitical, and our aims are not limited to engaging the public with science. It is difficult not to notice the paucity of women in science, especially at the top of the career ladder, and the lack of recognition for the work that women scientists do. You'd think in the 21st century - the age of equality - things would be improving. Soapbox Science aims to make a real difference to the visibility and perception of women in science. Since 2011, it has been used as a platform to showcase female scientists at the height of discovery and innovation, helping boost their public profile while widening their career opportunities. Soapbox Science is already nationally cited alongside the Athena SWAN program as an effective approach for addressing gender gap in science careers: with this project, we aspire to build on this reputation and become a leading international platform for actively promoting women in science, especially those conducting STFC-related research in which women are the worst represented across the scientific community.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-10-09</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>89240</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Widely in the media. e.g. The Guardian, February 2016: Where to get your science fix
