These small molecules oxidize and disable other larger biological molecules, much in the way that household bleach is able to attack ?germs?. As a response to this defence mechanism various enzymes have evolved in the microbes that provide a secondary pathogenic defence mechanism against these hydrogen peroxide-like molecules. This project will look at the three-dimensional atomic structure of three novel enzymes (AhpD, GPXI and APX) that are components of the defence mechanisms of the two pathogens, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (a slow growing bacterium that give rises to tuberculosis) and Trypanosoma cruzi (a parasitic flagellate bacterium). Knowing the structures of these enzymes will enable us to better understand the way in which they operate and carry out their function. This knowledge will be an important milestone for the future development of small molecule specific inhibitors with potential for development as therapeutic agents (drugs). About 8-10 million people a year become newly infected with tuberculosis and an increasing percentage of patients display resistance to the main drugs used for treatment. World-wide around 2-3 million people per year fatally succumb to the disease, with disportionate consequence for less highly developed countries. Trypanosoma cruzi is the causative agent of Chagas? disease that, in Latin America, kills 50,000 people a year. Currently there is no effective treatment for Chagas?. This programme of research is focused upon rationally selected enzyme targets in these pathogenic organisms, giving the prospect that new approaches can be found to combat these debilitating and economically disastrous diseases.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Pathogens rely on efficient and specific oxidative stress defence mechanisms for their survival. Components of the enzymatic pathways involved in clearance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) provide potential therapeutic targets. However, the enzymes involved in the reduction of hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides, peroxidases and peroxiredoxins, are ubiquitous proteins found in all organisms. Furthermore, in eukaryotic cells, the peroxiredoxins are also involved in regulating H2O2-mediated signalling. Deciphering the intricate substrate specificities and evolutionary relationships of these enzymes that otherwise show a significant level of sequence and/or functional homologies depends on determining their three-dimensional structures. Within this research proposal we wish to capitalize on our experience from working on X-ray structures of Mycobacterium tuberculosis alkylhydroperoxidase AhpD, and to complete the work on AhpD by solving the structures of the inhibitor-bound complexes. Further, we will carry out structural studies of two of peroxidase enzymes from another pathogen -- T. cruzi -- for which we have significant body of preliminary data. In addition, we will generate suitable expression constructs for other members of this family of enzymes that will enable us to continue with their structural characterisation. We will implement X-ray crystallography, NMR and bioinformatics techniques to generate a comprehensive and integrated data framework that will allow us to predict reaction mechanisms and interpret the substrate specificities of these enzymes. In the long term, this work will provide the basis for the development of peroxidase specific and pathogen selective inhibitors.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-09-18</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2005-09-19</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>218849</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>School Visits</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8B5B3EDC-D0B0-40D9-B7D0-DE4F1297AA14</gtr:id><gtr:impact>My presentation of drug discovery process from the point of target identification to obtaining funding and clinical trials have received lots of interest. students asked probing scientific and ethical questions.
