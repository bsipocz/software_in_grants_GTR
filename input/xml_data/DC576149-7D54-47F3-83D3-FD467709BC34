pacman</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>BB/I021345/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Development of an organism from egg to adult requires sets of genes to be switched on and off at particular times and in the correct order. If genes are not switched off when necessary, cells can continue to multiply in an uncontrolled way leading to cancer. As well as being important in cancer, gene regulation is crucial in controlling the balance between stem cell self-renewal and pathways to cell specialisation which are required to form the particular cells and tissues in the body. Since stem cells have a vast potential in regenerative medicine for the replacement of defective tissue, the understanding of gene control is crucial for harnessing the potential of these cells. Therefore studying the mechanisms whereby genes are switched off (as well as on) is vitally important for providing basic knowledge that has potential to lead to novel therapeutics. Using the fruit fly Drosophila as a model organism, we have recently discovered that an enzyme named Pacman is involved in the growth and differentiation of imaginal discs, which form adult structures such as wings and legs. Imaginal discs are similar to stem cells in that they carry the information to build the adult tissue. We have shown that Pacman normally affects the production of a protein called Simjang (Korean for 'strong heart') which in turn controls a gene silencing complex (the NuRD complex) which shuts down parts of the chromosome, preventing genes from being turned on. This gene silencing complex is important because it is known to be involved in many critical cellular events including tissue regeneration, formation of blood cells, ageing and spread of cancer cells. This is the first time that an enzyme involved in degradation of messenger RNA has been shown to be directly affecting a gene silencing complex. The aim of this project is to understand how the Pacman uses Simjang to control particular sets of genes involved in growth and differentiation. Our hypothesis is that, in normal cells, simjang messenger RNA is somehow 'tagged' for destruction so that not much of Simjang protein is made. This means that there is not enough Simjang to turn on the gene silencing complexes. These gene silencing complexes, when activated, normally act as 'brakes' to prevent growth and differentiation of the wing disc. Therefore when the brake is not pressed by Simjang, these genes are not turned on, allowing normal growth and development of the tissue. When the pacman gene is mutated, there is no (or little) degradation of simjang RNA, resulting in more Simjang protein, which turns on the gene silencing complexes (i.e. presses the brake) therefore switching on genes that prevent tissue growth and development. In this project we aim to test this hypothesis, find out the details of this gene control pathway and identify the genes which act as brakes to prevent growth and development. The mechanism of gene regulation which forms the basis of this proposal is entirely novel; as yet no research group has found this link between RNA degradation and gene silencing. Since all the proteins involved are similar in Drosophila and humans the new 'control module' we have discovered is likely to be relevant to gene regulation in humans. Since Pacman is known to be important in other important cellular events such as wound healing, migration of cell sheets, and male fertility, this work may also shed light on the molecular mechanisms of these processes in other tissues. Therefore the insights we gain during this project may help us to improve treatment for cancer and other diseases and also help us to understand the ways that tissues grow and develop. This project will therefore provide valuable insights into a new method of gene regulation which can be used in the development of new therapeutics.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Pacman/Xrn1 is a highly conserved cytoplasmic exoribonuclease which is known to play a crucial role in gene regulatory events such as control of mRNA stability, RNA interference and regulation via microRNAs. Using Drosophila as a model system, we have shown that mutations in pacman result in larvae with small imaginal wing discs and complete lethality at the early pupal stage. These results demonstrate that pacman is involved in regulation of growth and differentiation of wing discs. Furthermore, our data suggest that pacman targets a particular set of transcripts in this tissue and that the effect is tissue specific. To determine the particular set of transcripts targeted by Pacman, we carried out microarray analysis, supported by quantitative RT-PCR, on mRNA extracted from 3rd instar imaginal wing discs. We have shown that rather few mRNAs are expressed at substantially higher levels in the mutant discs compared to wild-type. Comparison of pre-mRNA and mRNA levels of these top-ranked transcripts identified one transcript, simjang/p66, which is post-transcriptionally regulated by Pacman. Simjang is highly conserved, and is known to be a component of the NuRD histone deacetylation complex which is involved in epigenetic gene silencing. This is the first time that a direct link has been shown between RNA stability and chromatin modification. The overall aim of the project is to understand how Pacman acts via Simjang to control growth and differentiation in the imaginal disc. Our hypothesis is that Pacman normally degrades simjang RNA resulting low levels of Simjang and lack of activation of the NuRD complex at a number of critical sites in the Drosophila genome. The resulting relief of silencing of particular sets of genes allows activation of other genes controlling growth and differentiation of the wing disc. The complementary techniques to be used to test this hypothesis will make use of the range of tools and reagents available in the Drosophila model system.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research? This project is primarily 'basic, blue-sky research' which nevertheless is likely to lead to new insights important for new therapeutics in the future. Beneficiaries in the public sector already include clinicians, who are benefiting from the knowledge and techniques developed from our current BBSRC-funded research. Since the focus of the proposed project is gene regulation, it is relevant for many fields of clinical research. Other potential beneficiaries include Industrial collaborators and the general public, particularly school children. How will they benefit from this research? Clinicians will benefit from the proposed research because the project addresses the regulation of gene expression during growth and development. Since control of epigenetic gene silencing is important in many new therapeutics and in cancer, this project will provide fundamental insights which will be relevant to their research. A greater understanding of the role of Pacman/Xrn1 in controlling gene silencing is likely to benefit clinicians who are seeking new cancer therapies. There is already significant interest in epigenetic transcriptional regulation by chromatin remodelling complexes since HDAC chemical inhibitors have shown potential as anti-cancer agents. Since we have previously shown that pacman/xrn-1 is involved in RNA interference, these studies are also of strategic relevance since they may lead to new technologies for post-genomic research and gene therapy. The skills and expertise gained by the post-doc during the project will also benefit clinicians. The cross-fertilization between the BBSRC-funded research of my group and local clinicians/scientists has already resulted in collaborative projects. For example, local clinicians have already benefited from our expertise in microarray analysis in a joint project on the use of microRNAs as biomarkers in certain leukaemias. This research, which is funded by a small grant, has already shown excellent promise and we hope to develop a suitable biomarker within the next two years. In addition, in an existing collaboration with Dr. Liz James, from the University of Brighton, we are using our research skills to help her and her industrial partners to develop new therapeutics for wound healing, which involve seeding of cells on novel biomaterials. Therefore, the continuation of these collaborations, aided by the proposed BBSRC grant, is likely to enhance the quality of life in the UK. The research skills gained by both the post-doc and the research technician will be valuable to their future careers and applicable to Biomedical Industries. In addition, the post-doc will be in a position to teach high-level techniques to PhD students including clinical PhD and MD students. The proposed project will therefore benefit the biomedical knowledge of future NHS clinicians. Summary of Planned Impact activities 1. We will continue to give seminars/presentations on our work to general audiences, where applicable. This will include, for example, the annual South Coast RNA network meeting in November of each year and which is attended by potential Industrial sponsors. 2. We will present our work to clinical colleagues at Networking events organised by the University of Sussex Business and Enterprize office. This includes the local Sussex Cancer Network. 3. We will continue to talk about our research to schoolchildren during Open Days and by appointment. 4. We will seek Industrial sponsorship of our work through the London Technology Network. 5. We plan to build on our existing collaborative work with colleagues at the Universities of Sussex and Brighton, and also with clinical colleagues at local hospitals. 6. We aim to use our existing Industrial Enterprize funding from the University of Sussex to develop our novel ideas on cancer biomarkers with a view to licencing our product to a Pharmaceutical company.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>447194</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Royal Veterinary College (RVC)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Royal Veterinary College, London</gtr:description><gtr:id>AD480268-6650-4DF6-926C-94DA07D36273</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Five conference presentations.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54648e8a87e655.48943644-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>They have already provided us with primary canine osteoblasts.

The first meeting, in November 2009, was organised by myself, Professor Simon Morley and the University of Sussex Business and Enterprize Office. The half-day meeting, which was free to Academic delegates, was extremely successful and has been followed up by a second meeting in November 2010 at the University of Surrey, a 3rd meeting in November 2011 at the University of Portsmouth and a subsequent meetings at the University of Kent and the University of Sussex. The co-organisers for these meetings are post-docs and PhD students, which gave them an opportunity to learn the skills of meeting organisation. Another meeting is planned in November, hosted by the University of Portsmouth.



This series of meetings has give rise to a number of research collaborations and successful grant applications.

A parent emailed me this morning to express her thanks to you all for coming in, I've copied and pasted her email at the end of this email.
Another parent approached me this morning to tell me her son didn't stop talking about you all when he home. Our students after meeting you
were both inspired and enthused&amp;quot;.

&amp;quot;Dear Mrs Chisholm,
I am just writing to say thank you to you and the industries who took part yesterday evening. Jessica was very enthusiastic about the event
and was not only interested in the industries themselves but said how approachable and pleasant the representatives were.
Thank you for organising the event.

Application and Exploitation
Our current and previous BBSRC-funded research has resulted in significant Impact regarding commercialising outputs of our research. To date, this is mainly in the form of commercialisation of microRNA biomarkers for use in prognosis/diagnosis of human disease. The research of my group has caught the interest of many clinicians in BSMS resulting in a number of ongoing collaborations (listed below). In particular, my collaborator Tim Chevassut and I have obtained funding from the University of Sussex Enterprise Fund to develop microRNA biomarkers from the blood cancer myeloma. This has resulted in the application for a world-wide patent of 3 microRNA biomarkers. IP issues are being managed through the University of Sussex offices and the Sussex Innovation Centre are dealing with the marketing. A number of Industrial partners are interested in our research and, together with colleagues in the Sussex Innovation centre, I have liased with them with a view to a licencing the product. Therefore, my group is familiar with the process of commercialisation and is regarded as something of a success story! (see http://www.sinc.co.uk/business-directory/89/index.html).

2. Collaboration and Co-production
As the project is being carried out in a Medical School, there is ample opportunity for interaction with Medical Colleagues in collaborative research. This has already resulted in the following established and ongoing collaborations:
1. Dr Tim Chevassut (BSMS): microRNAs as biomarkers in myeloma. The Sussex Innovation Centre are at present helping us to find an Industrial partner.
2. Dr Martin Llewelyn and Dr Stefano Caserta (BSMS): microRNAs as biomarkers in sepsis and toxic shock. My BBSRC-funded postdocs taught Dr Llewelyn's postdocs the methods required for miRNA analysis. Dr Caserta is at present narrowing down the useful miRNA biomarkers for diagnostic use.
3. Prof. Tony Metcalfe (Blond McIndoe Research Foundation, East Grinstead): microRNAs as biomarkers in melanoma. I have been awarded a BBSRC Sparking Impact award for this work to fund patent searches, marketing, a workshop and for a postdoc (Dr Sarah Smalley) to liase with Industry. We have a formal collaboration agreement and an MTA agreement to support this work. Dr Smalley worked worked part-time in my lab and is benefited from the expertise of my postdocs.

5. Dr Matthew Pead (Royal Vet College), Dr Imelda McGonnell (Royal Vet College) and Dr Kenneth Rankin (University of Newcastle): Role of XRN1 in osteosarcoma in humans and domestic dogs. This is a new collaboration where we at present are setting up the collaboration agreements and MTAs. Pacman/XRN1 are potentially novel drug targets for this childhood and canine cancer.

3. Communications and engagement
(a) Communication with Stakehoders.
A workshop on biomarkers funded by the BBSRC Sparking Impact Award, is to take place. This is primarily aimed at Clinicians and Industrialists. 
(e) Schools and public engagement
I have regularly hosted a school student in my lab to introduce them to RNA Research and will continue to do so. We will also organise a School visit to talk to the children about Genetics. In addition, groups of parents are invited for lab tours during the open days for Medical Students which take place each year. 
(d) Websites and interactive media.
The work of my group is often chosen by the BSMS public engagement offices to be published in a way that is accessible to the general audience. Research news, together with brief explanations of research in layman's language, is regularly published on the BSMS Website.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>355A4022-1E16-4EED-8F61-EE0F7E642E20</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5463b0aa58c524.50222255</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput><gtr:description>The invention relates to novel biological markers for plasma cell disorders, such as multiple myeloma, and in particular to the use of microRNAs as diagnostic and prognostic markers in assays for detecting such disorders.

If genes are not switched off when necessary, cells can continue to multiply in an uncontrolled way leading to cancer. As well as being important in cancer, gene regulation is crucial in controlling the balance between stem cell self-renewal and pathways to cell specialisation which are required to form the particular cells and tissues in the body. Since stem cells have a vast potential in regenerative medicine for the replacement of defective tissue, the understanding of gene controls is crucial for harnessing the potential of these cells. Therefore studying the mechanisms whereby genes are switched off (as well as on) is vitally important for providing basic knowledge that has potential to lead to novel therapeutics.

Using the fruit fly Drosophila as a model organism, we have recently discovered that an enzyme named Pacman is involved in the growth and differentiation of imaginal discs, which form adult structures such as wings and legs. Imaginal discs are similar to stem cells in that they carry the information to build the adult tissue. The aim of this project is to understand how the Pacman targets particular sets of genes involved in growth and differentiation.

The key findings, to date, are as follows:

1. Whole-genome transcriptomic analyses have shown that a rather small number of mRNAs and miRNAs are substantially increased or decreased in levels in pcm5 mutant discs. Of these misexpressed mRNAs, we have identified four that are upregulated at the post-transcriptional level in pcm5 mutants, suggesting that they could be directly affected by the Pacman exoribonuclease. These transcripts include one that encodes the heat-shock protein Hsp67Bc, which is upregulated 11.9-fold at the post-transcriptional level and 2.3-fold at the protein level. One miRNA, miR-277-3p, was post-transcriptionally downregulated, which is consistent with Pacman being specifically involved in the biogenesis of this miRNA. Since Hsp67Bc is known to regulate autophagy/apoptosis and protein synthesis, it is possible that Pacman may control the growth of wing imaginal discs by regulating these processes.

2. Using Drosophila wing imaginal discs as a model system, we have demonstrated that a null mutation in pacman results in small imaginal discs as well as lethality during pupation. Mutant wing discs show an increase in the number of cells undergoing apoptosis (programmed cell death), especially in the wing pouch area. Compensatory proliferation also occurs in these mutant discs, but this is insufficient to compensate for the concurrent increase in apoptosis. The phenotypic effects of the pacman null mutation are rescued by a mutation that removes one copy of each of the pro-apoptotic genes reaper, hid and grim, demonstrating that pacman acts through this pathway. The null pacman mutation also results in a significant increase in the expression of the pro-apoptotic hid and reaper mRNAs, with this increase mostly occurring at the post-transcriptional level, suggesting that Pacman normally targets these mRNAs. Our results uncover a novel function for the conserved exoribonuclease Pacman and suggest that this exoribonuclease is important in the regulation of apoptosis in other organisms.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>An unforeseen consequence of the research carried out in the project is the relevance of the above research to the bone cancer osteosarcoma. The homologue of the Pacman gene in humans, XRN1, is downregulated in this cancer. We have obtained pump-priming funding as well as a PhD studentship to carry out initial work to understand how Pacman/XRN1, may contribute to osteosarcoma progression. 

Another unexpected consequence relates to our expertise in identifying microRNAs in the circulating blood for use as biomarkers for disease. This arose from the lab-based and bioinformatic expertise built up during the project. This expertise has led to a number of new projects focused on identifying miRNAs as prognostic biomarkers in myeloma, sepsis and melanoma together with current work on motor neurone disease.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>25BCE644-3DD8-4E65-8DE8-74887B127696</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-280840005.9871748777060cc</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Participated at the Sarcoma Research Symposium (Basic Science) &amp;quot;What causes sarcoma?&amp;quot;</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F9275A3C-E59E-496D-A03E-112AE90D5323</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c68ac859b2c2.77141402</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs><gtr:productOutput><gtr:description>We have identified 3 miRNA biomarkers for use in predicting the recurrence on melanoma.</gtr:description><gtr:id>07584553-DB3D-4262-B244-7A44B2FF36A4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None as yet</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6a7d31229a0.57535892</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:stage>Initial development</gtr:stage><gtr:status>Actively seeking support</gtr:status><gtr:title>miRNA biomarkers for melanoma from circulating blood</gtr:title><gtr:type>Diagnostic Tool - Non-Imaging</gtr:type><gtr:yearDevCompleted>2017</gtr:yearDevCompleted></gtr:productOutput><gtr:productOutput><gtr:description>We have found a microRNA signature in serum derived from the circulating blood of patients which is likely to be useful in the diagnosis/prognosis of myeloma.</gtr:description><gtr:id>16226079-1F2C-4CA6-AAF9-AE41B0B059A5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Similar techniques can be used to identify biomarkers for other diseases.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>546342c3bb5a05.22028367</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:stage>Initial development</gtr:stage><gtr:status>Actively seeking support</gtr:status><gtr:title>microRNA biomarker for diagnosis/prognosis of myeloma</gtr:title><gtr:type>Diagnostic Tool - Non-Imaging</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.google.com/patents/US20140194467</gtr:url><gtr:yearDevCompleted>2014</gtr:yearDevCompleted></gtr:productOutput><gtr:productOutput><gtr:description>We have identified a set of microRNAs from circulating blood that can distinguish sepsis from severe inflammation.</gtr:description><gtr:id>69E51839-FFFC-4CCE-934D-DFA72A1369BD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None as yet</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d853bda3ae24.68100102</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:stage>Initial development</gtr:stage><gtr:status>Under active development/distribution</gtr:status><gtr:title>Biomarker for Sepsis and SIRS</gtr:title><gtr:type>Diagnostic Tool - Non-Imaging</gtr:type><gtr:yearDevCompleted>2016</gtr:yearDevCompleted></gtr:productOutput></gtr:productOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Drosophila stocks expressing mutant versions of pacman.
