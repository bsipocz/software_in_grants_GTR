In an emergency medical situation, ambulances must get to those in need as quickly as possible in order to provide care and, ultimately, to save lives. Decisions about which ambulance should respond to each incident need to be made rapidly. However, making such decisions is complicated: incidents can occur simultaneously or in short succession over a wide area; the locations of ambulances are constantly changing; and there are many environmental factors that can affect response times, such as traffic and weather conditions. In such a complex and dynamic environment, a form of automated decision support, known as computer assisted dispatch (CAD), is often installed to help staff make these decisions.

In recent years, there has been a sharp expansion in the volume and types of data sources that might potentially be linked to CAD, presenting new possibilities for improving current decision-support systems. Doing so could enable ambulances to respond faster as emergency situations develop, improving emergency care, lowering costs, increasing efficiency and improving health outcomes for patients. Potentially useful data might come from any of the following sources: the general population (via social media and other mobile Apps); specific user segments (via in-home/wearable sensors, particularly for high-risk patient groups); urban infrastructure (via public transport monitors, embedded road sensors or weather stations); and other public sector actors (such as collaborating emergency response agencies or healthcare providers).

This proposed Policy Demonstrator Project, entitled &amp;quot;Data Awareness for Sending Help&amp;quot; (DASH), aims to explore the potential of these &amp;quot;new data&amp;quot; sources for improving ambulance response times. The project builds on a new research collaboration between King's College London (KCL) and the London Ambulance Service (LAS), which is evaluating novel methods for ambulance dispatch by simulating ambulance call-outs based on historical LAS system logs. DASH will lay the groundwork for extending this preliminary study in important new directions, by predicting changes in response times due to integration of additional data sources.

There are a number of challenges that DASH aims to address, both technical, in terms of how feasible it is to access and use new data sources reliably, and social or ethical, in terms of how acceptable and appropriate it is to use data in this way, particularly data about individuals. DASH asks three specific research questions:

(1) What are the benefits and risks for emergency service agencies, healthcare providers and the public related to linking new and emerging data sources to emergency response? A comprehensive literature review and targeted focus groups will highlight which new data sources could be tapped and will weigh benefits, costs and risks associated with data-enhanced emergency response, across various sectors.

(2) What are the technical challenges involved in linking new and emerging data sources to CAD technologies to provide the most important benefits? A technical investigation will consider practical aspects of linking new data sources to CAD and will explore innovative modelling methods that could be applied in a low-cost but high-impact and secure manner.

(3) How can practitioners and policymakers learn from our study of linking new and emerging data sources to the London Ambulance Service? DASH will produce a set of outputs designed to inform practitioners and policymakers, including: a Policy Brief outlining our findings; a Case Study that assesses linking new data and associated methodologies to LAS's CAD system; a Software Prototype, built on previous work, that demonstrates how a data-enhanced CAD system might work; and a report on the broader applicability of the findings to other emergency response agencies in the UK.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Timely and efficient ambulance response is a major challenge for the UK. The BBC News recently reported that only 1 in 13 ambulance services are meeting their targets for response times (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-38077409). One of the reasons for slowdowns occurs in A&amp;amp;Es, where ambulance crews have to wait before handing over patients to under-staffed hospital personnel. Wales is the only region not lagging behind, and that is because they changed how incident calls are classified so that fewer are required to be completed in the shortest response time of 8 minutes. With an ageing population nationwide and over-stressed National Health Service (NHS), the demands on ambulances and crews will only increase.

This proposed &amp;quot;Data Awareness for Sending Help&amp;quot; (DASH) project investigates how new and emerging forms of data could help improve efficiency of emergency response services. The interdisciplinary nature of the project means that it has the potential to benefit a wide-ranging set of stakeholders:

* the general public, who are the ultimate beneficiaries of the research proposed here, the people who will experience first-hand more efficient operational models of emergency response services;

* the providers of emergency services and health care, and partner organisations such as Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs), as well as government officials and general policy makers; and

* researchers who study policy, healthcare and technology, from emergency response and medical specialists to general policy researchers, to computer science, artificial intelligence and operational research experts.

DASH will produce a Case Study around the London Ambulance Service (LAS), which will not only benefit LAS directly, but also its working partners and peers: other emergency services agencies and healthcare providers. DASH will make a valuable contribution to future strategic and operational development of LAS by identifying and assessing specific benefits and risks of linking new and emerging sources of data to LAS computer assisted dispatch (CAD), quantified through operational efficiency indicators. Findings will be extrapolated to other emergency services agencies nationwide. The impact of producing the Case Study will be measured in terms of stakeholder feedback in the short term and changes in practice in the long term.

DASH will build a Software Prototype, extending prior work of project investigators, to simulate dispatch conditions and allow researchers to visualise historical scenarios and ask &amp;quot;what if&amp;quot; questions about future scenarios. Researchers from operational research, computer science and artificial intelligence, as well as applied researchers in policy and public health, will benefit from the opportunity to consider the effects of linking new and emerging data and modelling methodologies to CAD, within a specific real-world context (LAS), as well as more broadly across the UK. The impact of producing the Software Prototype will be measured directly in terms of usage statistics, and indirectly in terms of citations.

DASH will publish a Policy Brief describing the potential for new and emerging forms of data to have a transformative effect on the effectiveness and efficiency of emergency services delivery. Thus, specialist practitioners, general policymakers and the general public will benefit from insights into the policy potential of new and emerging forms of data. The impact of the Policy Brief will be measured through direct feedback from those who read the brief, as well as other, indirect measures such as social media and press monitoring.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>195311</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/P011160/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
