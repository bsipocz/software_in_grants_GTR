Biotic factors include pathogens that disclose their presence to plants by Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs), such as bacterial flagellin, lipopolysaccharide, peptidoglycon and fungal chitin. On the other hand, plants have cell surface receptors that scan the environment for incoming would be pathogens. There are three types of cell surface receptors in plants; a) completely outside the cell such as polygalacturanase inhibitor (PGIP), b) majority of the protein is outside the cell but a short tail within the cytoplasm, known as receptor-like proteins (RLP) and c) receptor part is outside but also has a large part in the cytoplasm that acts as a catalytic domain such as receptor-like kinase (RLK). These receptor proteins may function to recognize microbial PAMPs, may confer resistance to specific pathogens, and could interact with each other to activate downstream signaling.

T-DNA insertion lines of 55 RLP- and 90 RLK-encoding genes have been screened with various isolates of H. parastica and P. infestans. A couple of RLP mutants showed enhanced susceptibility to H. parasitica during adult stage indicating that these genes might play a role in age related resistance. Similarly, several RLP and RLK mutants showed enhanced susceptibility to a few different isolates of H. parasitica at the seedling stage. The most striking finding was the growth of P. infestans on some of these RLK mutants. The accepted dogma suggests that Arabidopsis-P. infestans interaction is incompatible, the plant is non-host and the pathogen is non-adapted or inappropriate. We approached with the view that a) non-host resistance is part of the innate immunity and b) cell surface receptors may recognize any incoming pathogens and the information may be processed very quickly leading to restriction of pathogen growth. We screened the RLP mutants with a P. infestans isolate and mainly HR response was observed. No mutant showing any disease development was identified. However, when the RLK mutants were screened with the same isolate of P. infestans, a variation in symptom development was observed. We adopted a scoring system from 0 to 5 where 0 is no symptom or HR, 1 is local chlorosis, 2 is extended chlorosis, 3 necrosis, 4 extended necrosis and hyphal growth and 5 is total collapse of tissues. We have identified 3 different RLK genes showing disease development indicating that they may play a role in conferring resistance to this pathogen. The third oomycete pathogen, Albugo candida, has not been explored in the screening of these mutants. Our aim in this project is 1) to investigate the identified putative mutants further by a) identifying additional T-D</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>280780</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Th PI was involved in outreach activity, especially towards grammar schools (e.g. Alcestor Grammar) and gave talks to AS/A level biology students about scientific research-how it is conducted, where it takes you and importance of the research-led education.

The main aim of this proposal is to understand the role of cell surface receptors in activating the immune system of plants.
Mutants will be used to investigate the role of these immune receptors in recognition of oomycete pathogens including
downy mildew and white rusts of brasssicas and late blight pathogen of potato and tomato. We have initial data
suggesting that mutation in some of these genes result in enhanced pathogen growth and disease development. For
example, mutation in 3 different RLK-encoding genes allows the growth of late blight pathogen of tomato, P. infestans.
Detailed studies of these genes would help us to construct a strategy to control this disease in tomato and potato.
 We have identified at least 12 different RLKs showing enhanced susceptibility to downy mildew, one of which has been investigated further. We also discovered that BKK1 is negatively regulated by ERECTA, another receptor, and we shared this data with Antonio Molino, who works on this gene and is also in our ERA-PG network. Most importantly, we discovered that PEPR1 and PEPR2 are involved in the recognition of downy mildew and our further investigation into PROPEP (precursor protein), AtPep1 (ligand)-PEPR1&amp;amp; PEPR2 (receptors) showed that this system is also involved in the osmotic stress, forming a bridge between immune activation and osmotic regulation. This needed a bit further investigation and the we are now in a position to publish this data.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Since our work was on the plant receptors, the finding could be used to;
a) identify pathogen ligands- This has been successfully applied by colleagues in different universities and research stations.

b) deploy to crop plants for controlling diseases

c) can be used for further investigations to reveal the nature of plant-microbe interactions-A PhD student in my group recently used these materials in her study to identify interactors, results of which will be published later.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>758C8E79-2203-4960-87B1-C558229A03A6</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-2719834188.669766774ae626</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.plantcell.org/content/23/6/2440.full</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5B086D77-8A96-4D27-8C42-86A075145430</gtr:id><gtr:title>Pattern-recognition receptors [PRR] in plants</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/64bd5b423f03216fed9877d166a7a279"><gtr:id>64bd5b423f03216fed9877d166a7a279</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mahmut Tor (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2008-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>m_7418431415140db326</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>267DF58A-0CD6-4907-A189-A5041713FED4</gtr:id><gtr:title>Receptor-mediated signalling in plants: molecular patterns and programmes.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of experimental botany</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/893d2fc5f50935a6717d876f27238139"><gtr:id>893d2fc5f50935a6717d876f27238139</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>T?r M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0022-0957</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>pm_53cbfa5bfa509fa24</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AC07E734-4962-4B68-BF11-3E445F5C1386</gtr:id><gtr:title>Tapping into molecular conversation between oomycete plant pathogens and their hosts</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>European Journal of Plant Pathology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/893d2fc5f50935a6717d876f27238139"><gtr:id>893d2fc5f50935a6717d876f27238139</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>T?r M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2008-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cfdafdae112ca2</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>807DD068-C673-482F-B13F-DF0903A734B3</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Arabidopsis leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases BAK1/SERK3 and BKK1/SERK4 are required for innate immunity to hemibiotrophic and biotrophic pathogens.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Plant cell</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/e2cb9b6dec6a10fd766624a644014f1c"><gtr:id>e2cb9b6dec6a10fd766624a644014f1c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Roux M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1040-4651</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>pm_5435ac65ac6086ee6</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>DE21A729-8DAB-417F-A338-C6D2ADD3657C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Arabidopsis Damage Associated Molecular Pattern Peptide1 (AtPep1) and its Receptors PEPR1 and PEPR2 are Involved in Osmotic Stress Response</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9d9e04e905bfe2ddc4770a817f3d5f23"><gtr:id>9d9e04e905bfe2ddc4770a817f3d5f23</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mahmut Tor (Co-author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>m_2253305412140db3ee</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/E02484X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
