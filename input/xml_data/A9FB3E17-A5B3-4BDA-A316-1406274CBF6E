While ageing is associated with a plethora of complications, which increasingly burdens health systems worldwide, a major cause of morbidity and mortality amongst the elderly is the decreased functionality of the immune system, which manifests as increased susceptibility of the elderly to infection. While 20th century medicine developed an excellent intervention that limits debilitating infection, i.e. vaccination, older individuals do not generate good protective immunity after vaccination. The factors that cause this age-dependent decreased functionality of the immune system are not well understood, and this project aims to understand the mechanisms that underlie poor immunity in older individuals.

Vaccination generates protective immunity through production of secreted molecules called antibodies, which are exquisitely specific for a given pathogen and shut down an infection before it takes hold. These antibodies are produced from a long-lived cell, called a plasma cell, and these cells are generated from B cells in the lymph node during a reaction called the germinal centre (GC). In order to generate protective immunity, one needs a good GC reaction that produces lots of plasma cells that make high amounts of good quality antibody. This requires the intricate interaction of several different cell types, including immune cells such as B and T cells, as well as the stromal cells of the lymph node.

Stromal cells are structural support cells present in all organs; in lymph nodes they both recruit and maintain immune cell types, and tell them where and how to interact. To date, very little research has addressed how ageing affects lymph node stromal cells; the few studies that are available suggest that there is a functional defect in aged lymph node stromal cells, but the extent of this defect is not known. Indeed, the stromal cells are so important in coordinating the immune cells that a defect in these cells could have profound effects on the generation of good immunity. I will investigate how the stromal cells are altered in aged individuals, by using cutting edge analysis of gene expression in young and aged lymph node stromal cells. I will then use this analysis to determine how the aged stromal cells influence the ability of immune cells to enter the lymph node. I will then extend this study to understanding how the lymph node stromal cells respond to a vaccination, and how this impacts on the development of the GC. All of this research will be complemented by research on human samples to ensure its translational relevance.

This research will be undertaken at the Babraham Institute, a world-leader in scientific research, with a particularly strong immunology department. The project will be undertaken in the lab of Dr. Michelle Linterman, an expert in the GC response. Dr. Linterman's lab is currently investigating the effect of ageing on the immune cells in the GC reaction, and thus this project directly complements that of the host laboratory. Moreover, the Babraham Institute is very well resourced, with access to numerous excellent facilities that are required for the successful completion of this project. This project will also involve interaction with experts in stromal immunology, namely Dr. Anne Fletcher, who is based at the University of Birmingham.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The germinal centre (GC) response, which occurs in secondary lymphoid organs, is key to the generation of protective immunity in response to immunisation. The GC response requires the coordinated interaction of immune cells such as T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, and B cells, as well as stromal cells such as follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) and fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs). Much research has focused on the mechanisms of B and T cell ageing, but little is known of the effects of ageing on FRCs/FDCs. Considering that FRCs and FDCs are critical regulators of lymph node architecture and immune cell trafficking and interaction, defects in FRC/FDC function could have profound effects on the generation of protective immunity. This project hypothesises that ageing results in significant functional defects in FRCs/FDCs, which have direct effects on the generation of immune responses. 

I will test this hypothesis by assessing the phenotype and functionality of lymph node stromal cells in young and aged lymph nodes, including RNA-seq and live cell imaging. I will then assess the stromal cell response to immunisation in aged mice, alongside the development of immune responses, and determine how the age-dependent changes in FRCs and FDCs affects the GC response. I will also assess the quality of protective immunity generated in these different mouse models by immunisation and lethal virus infection. The project will also involve translational research, investigating the phenotypic and functional defects in human FRCs/FDCs from young and aged individuals. This work will identify how FRCs/FDCs become dysfunctional with age, and how this impacts on the generation of immune responses. Thus, this work will not acknowledge stromal cells as a viable target for therapeutic modulation of the immune response, but will also give insight into the biology of stromal cells, and their important roles in modulating protective and detrimental immune responses.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research contained in this project is likely to have impact on several areas. 

Academics:
The main beneficiaries are likely to be scientists working in my own field and closely related fields, namely stromal immunologists and immunologists working on the germinal centre response. I anticipate that the work will result in advancement of our knowledge of lymph node structure and function in ageing and how this impacts on the generation of immune responses. As such, the outcomes of this research are likely to be wide reaching, including those who work on protective immunity, autoimmunity, cancer, wound healing and fibrosis. The work may also benefit researchers outside these fields, for example those who work in stromal cell biology in other tissues and those that work on age-associated morbidities such as sarcopaenia; the potential role of stromal cells in such diseases is unknown, but could be of great importance. In the long term I anticipate that the work contained in this fellowship will have important clinical impacts, both in the design of novel vaccine strategies that will improve vaccination in older people, but also in other immune-related therapies. This includes areas such as autoimmune therapy and cancer immunotherapy, where the potential to manipulate stromal cells is only just now being fully appreciated. All of these impacts have the potential to significantly improve the health and quality of life of patients across a spectrum of ages and disease types.

Commercial sector:
The commercial sector is likely to benefit from this research through improved knowledge of stromal cell function in normal biology and ageing. This will feed into, for example, novel vaccination strategies that could target stromal cells to promote their function in generating protective immunity; using stromal cells as a therapeutic agent to treat disease such as wound healing and sepsis; or even therapies that target stromal cells in situ to alter the course of disease, for example in fibrosis.

General public:
The long-term benefits of this research, that is the improved quality of life will have significant impacts for the general public, through improving their own health in age and promoting a healthy old age. Moreover, the improvement of health in the elderly will benefit younger relatives, for example relieving caring responsibilities. In addition, the work is likely to have impact on a number of other diseases, such as autoimmune disease, cancer and fibrosis. 

Economic impact:
The long-term impacts of this research, in promoting healthy ageing, will have economic impacts. This includes the improved capabilities of older people to contribute to society as well as diminishing a significant burden for health systems worldwide.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-02-29</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>304482</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>I have demonstrated defective expansion and differentiation of stromal cells in response to immunisation in multiple mouse strains.
