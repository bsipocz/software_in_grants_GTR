Health and Well-Being</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/K003364/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This highly collaborative study aims to examine how creative practice in the arts and humanities can promote the kinds of connectedness and reciprocity that support 'mutual recovery' in terms of mental health and well-being. The idea of 'mutual recovery' extends more inclusively out of the increasingly influential notion of 'recovery' in mental health care which refers to the possibility of achieving a meaningful, more resilient and self-reliant life irrespective of mental health 'symptoms' or disabilities. Typically, however, recovery-based initiatives tend to focus exclusively on people identified as having mental health needs (service users) and overlook how hard-pressed informal carers and health, social care and adult education personnel working in this field may also need to 'recover' or be 'recovered' in terms of their own mental health and well-being. Our central hypothesis is that creative practice could be a powerful tool for bringing together this diverse range of social actors and communities of practice, to establish and connect them in a mutual or reciprocal fashion to enhance mental health and well-being. Such an approach is congruent with 'the new wave of mutuality' identified by Murray (2012), marked by 'renewed interest in co-operation' (p.1), enhancing connections and sharing between distinct or separate groups of people or institutions and 'different ways of involving users, communities and workers' (p.7).

Arts and expressive therapies are well-established in mental health services and creative practice (e.g. in visual arts, music, drama, storytelling and so on) has demonstrable potential for a role in advancing mutual recovery in this context. Research has already demonstrated the importance of the arts for 'recovery orientated mental health services', how they provide ways of breaking down social barriers, of expressing and understanding experiences and emotions, and of helping to rebuild identities and communities. 

With a growing burden of mental ill-health combined with rising costs for the delivery of services, it is timely to investigate how people with mental health needs, informal carers and health, social care and adult education personnel can take new opportunities to build mutually appreciative and substantively connected communities - resilient communities of mutual hope, trust, compassion, equality and solidarity. 

This five-year study will add a new dimension to existing AHRC-funded health humanities projects. Its substantive arts and humanities led programme of work packages incorporate a social sciences evaluative layer that seeks to advance transformative impacts in policy, provision and practice. Acting as a 'beacon', it will link researchers in the arts and humanities, social and health sciences and third and statutory sector organisations supporting people with mental health needs, in order to generate new forms of social and cultural connectedness that can facilitate mental health recovery. Consistent with the Connected Communities ethos, central themes in this research are the contribution of shared community values and participation to this mutual recovery agenda and the ways in which self-reliance and resilience can be 'co-produced' to support mental health and well-being in community settings. Hence, this ambitious, multidisciplinary research programme will address the AHRC Connected Communities vision through establishing new connections between academic and partner communities in order to enhance research participation, prosperity, sustainability, and health &amp;amp; well-being.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project has a potentially wide impact on public engagement and academic research. The principal beneficiaries of these impacts may be divided into three key groups:

1. Policy-makers: The project is designed to bring together diverse communities of arts and humanities and social and health sciences scholars, service user and carer representatives, and health, social care and education personnel, to respond to contemporary anxieties about mental health in the UK. As such, it is anticipated that research findings generated by the project will stimulate and inform mental health and social care debate, particularly as it relates to the development of policies that advance: a. less-centralised resources for responding to the mental health and well-being agenda; b. more co-operative, open and permeable interfaces between diverse social actors and communities of practice in the field of mental health. Linked to this it will contribute to debate and provide important evidence regarding the heightened priority put upon public mental health promotion and addressing the social causes of mental health problems in England (i.e. concerns with mental health inequalities) and the fact that currently this remains inadequately reflected in statutory approaches to mental health service provision.

2. Health, social care and education providers: The project will also be of interest to health, social care, education, and community arts organizations involved in mental health work and the promotion of more connected and self-caring communities. The interdisciplinary approach and methodology of the project aligns it with the emerging field of health humanities, in this case through a combination of visual arts, performing arts, literature/narrative, philosophy, history, sociology, anthropology, linguistics, psychology, psychiatry, social care, nursing, and public health. In particular, it will afford knowledge dissemination benefits with regard to the ways in which these fields animate one another. It is hoped that the research findings may ultimately inform organisational culture and practices within both NHS and private health, social care, education and community-based initiatives and, potentially, suggest increased effectiveness of public health services and/or reduced costs of NHS patient care.

3. Members of the public: We envisage potential social benefits for people with mental health difficulties, informal carers and the general public more broadly, these emanating primarily from the impact of the research on public awareness and understanding of issues pertaining to mutuality and creativity in mental health recovery. The research will produce outputs which will be public resources and the project will provide opportunities for public engagement about this important issue, educating individuals (who may also be potential users of mental health provisioning) about the investment taking place to support work in this area. It is envisaged that the project will generate public contribution to debate about ways to tackle societal challenges in the area of mental health and wellbeing, and ways of achieving more egalitarian and inclusive connections between and within communities in the field of mental health. We aim to inform attitudes to and/or beliefs about the feasibility of creative practice as mutual recovery being a possible solution to the failure of biomedical and psychiatric approaches to date to improve the mental health of the nation and to empower communities and individuals to deploy greater agency in their own mental health and well-being. 

In addition, it is hoped that the project will produce important social benefits in enhancing public, policy and practitioner understandings of new approaches to connecting communities for mental health and well-being and in effecting positive changes in mental health policy and in organisational, practitioner and public attitudes and behaviour.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1203198</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Based on the Making Music for Mental Health project, there is currently a group drumming programme offered in Kyoto, Japan.</gtr:description><gtr:id>22965329-F3A4-4510-95A6-52316EAAC76E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Members of the community, including older adults, have the opportunity to participate in a group drumming programme.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56c34cc69d8cf7.09974087</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Making Music for Mental Health: Kyoto Japan Community Drumming Group</gtr:title><gtr:type>Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Broadcast Quality Film: Mothers Make Art. 2015.

Melvyn began his education studying A 'level Art and Design with Art History and Media Studies at Clarendon College (Nottingham), from 1983 to 1985. From there he enrolled upon a one year Foundation Course at Trent Polytechnic from to of 1986 and went on to gain a place ar St. Martin's School of Art in London that same year.
Unfortunately, due to illness, Melvyn had to quit his studies. In May, 1987 he was put on a six month section order under the Mental Health Act. There began a series of admissions into hospital and he was diagnosed with Schizo-affective
disorder.
Melvyn has stayed out of hospital for the past 20 years, and gained much insight into the ways of the mind; in illness and in health. For the past 15 years he has created artwork from his studio space on Carrington St in Nottingham and
continues to be influenced by the affairs of Mankind - his folly and his wisdom, the World at war and the World at peace.
About the artwork
&amp;quot;As an artist, I'm particularly interested in the affairs of Mankind; its religion, its politics, its World -as it is and, maybe, as it should be. I believe in one God, but many cultures, creeds, races and religions.

Staring at the Sea by Mark Taylor
The work for this exhibition reflects my interest in the transcendental nature of the sea. Human culture and society are inexorably connected to the sea as the sea offers sustenance, hope and renewal. However, it also offers fear, uncertainty and incredible destructive power. Like many others I find myself drawn to the sea through what seems like a primal urge coupled with a fascination at the spectacle. The work I present here focuses on the calming influence of the sea and my personal connection with it. 

From a young age I have had to learn to cope with high levels of anxiety and bouts of clinical depression. This has to a large extent shaped my approach to personal work which often manifests itself as a form of therapy. In this instance, staring at the sea is something that becomes a meditative and contemplative experience. I enjoy the open space and the minimal aspect. The subtle interplay of light and colour between the Sea, sky and horizon offers an ever-changing aesthetic. The photographs in this exhibition are an attempt to reflect this. 
I take photographs here and there and then I spend hours patiently sieving through and find commonalities and connections, then classify them into to subject areas. This series is a combination of past work with additional new work made particularly for this show. There is a paradox of permanency and the ephemeral in windows/reflections . Eyes may be 'the window of the soul' but to me photographing windows/reflections is 'soothing of the soul' and more effective than medication for depression. 

Through a Glass Darkly by Tony Fisher
The work I am showing is concerning windows: reflections/mirroring what they physically look like, what can be seen through them or what we can be seen from them and how the elements interact with them. Some of the photographs show decay and deprivation, some express hope and a new beginning and others just show absurdity and a sense of fun.</gtr:description><gtr:id>ECAE7D3D-54FA-4C07-A8F8-BC83720BD182</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The launch of the exhibition is attended by mental health service users, art students and mental health professionals and researchers creating a space to promote social inclusion and reduce social isolation among service users.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56b32cb842a8d0.02743892</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Dissimilar Reflections</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.institutemh.org.uk/x-about-us-x/art-at-the-institute</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Based on the Making Music for Mental Health project, there is currently a group drumming programme offered in Lugano, Switzerland.</gtr:description><gtr:id>666772CB-7442-4E34-9E36-A8970977070C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Members of the community, including older adults, have the opportunity to participate in a group drumming programme.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56c34ce7c64701.34357000</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Making Music for Mental Health: Lugano, Switzerland Nursing Home Drumming Group</gtr:title><gtr:type>Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Broadcast Quality Film: Creative Practice as Mutual Recovery.

Howard Croft, Projects Development Manager for the organisation in West Midlands Region stated in an email to Dr Lydia Lewis on 25th September 2015:
&amp;quot;The Workers' Educational Association (WEA), West Midlands is very grateful for the support of the Connected Communities project in funding the production of still images and film montage to raise the profile and outcomes of our creative arts adult education provision within the region.We have a bank of around 80 high resolution images capturing students' work relating to Scrapbooking, Painting and Drawing, Sewing and Textiles and Jewellery making. These images have already been used in a variety of contexts. For example, inclusion in WEA West Midlands learner case studies, projects newsletter, regional website and will be used within the forthcoming Annual Review Report 2014/15. The film capturing students in their community setting, and the articles created as a result of their learning experience, has also been used on the regional website as a 'good news' story.
We have contracted Sheffield Vision (who produced the photos and film) again recently for some work on our 'Exploring the Impact of WW1 in Herefordshire' project funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund. In addition, the Connected Communities project - along with provision in other WEA regions - has inspired a follow on project application by the WEA to the Paul Hamlyn Foundation's 'More and Better Fund'. &amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>55ad2c81cccf87.51027998</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Library of photographic images of WEA's creative provision</gtr:title><gtr:type>Image</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.publicengagement.ac.uk/case-studies/mutual-recovery-through-creative-connection</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Flamenco Dance</gtr:description><gtr:id>B3156AD7-6502-488A-BB0B-44A4DF72205B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dance performed at MAD15, a carnival organised at the Institute of Mental Health by Making Waves,</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56b333e0b45270.97928460</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>Rumba</gtr:title><gtr:type>Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.makingwaves.org/news/carnival-mad15/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This a mental health arts competition organised at the Institute of Mental Health, The University of Nottingham and City Arts.

- Professional development opportunities for WEA staff members; training for WEA members and Dr Lydia Lewis in Mental Wellbeing Impact Assessment (MWIA).
- Impact on practice and provision: 
MWIA conducted on a WEA women's health course informed its development; 
Wider project provided the WEA with the opportunity to reflect on practice and to evaluate and evidence the impact of the charity's educational provision. This is described in the case study about the project referenced above, which was based on a joint interview with Clare White, WEA Project Manager and Lydia Lewis. The following extracts are drawn from this: 

For the WEA, the main motivation to collaborate with Lydia in the study was the opportunity to take a step back and reflect on everyday practice, as well as the prospect of having evidence of the impact of the training the organisation delivers in communities. Lydia's approach of spending time with the students through an entire course inspired Clare White's (WEA) confidence that the research would be in-depth enough to generate some valuable insights. The research has also tried to find mechanisms to add value to what people are doing on the courses. For example, instead of providing honoraria to individuals for participating in the research, some money was put into a pot to buy arts and crafts materials for the groups.

For WEA, being part of the project has meant that it has been properly funded to bring learners together to reflect. Although funders sometimes allocate small amounts for evaluation, this is usually too small to do anything meaningful. At the same time, the cost usually does not cover the administrative cost of pulling workshops together. The research funding of the partnership, on the other hand, is fully costed. It is also a long-term project, something else that is a rare luxury in the voluntary sector.

From: Martikke, Susanne (2014), Mutual Recovery through Creative Connection: National Co-ordinating Centre for Public Engagement Public Engagement Case Study. 

The WEA also gained valuable insights from participants' feedback about taking part in the research. This is discussed in the report of the study into community-university partnerships referenced above:

The questions service users asked the community partner organisation about the research project and its usefulness also shed light on service users' motivations for using the service the organisation provides. This, in turn benefited the organisation:
()

Community partner: Yeah, we've had a little bit of feedback which we wouldn't necessarily get through the paperwork, around people wondering why we're asking them about health and wellbeing questions, or it's got nothing to do with my mental health, you know. Actually, having the space to have those discussions is quite useful in terms of development and thinking about the motivation of why people come and what they want from the courses, it's quite useful. 

From: Martikke, S., Church, A. and Hart, A. (2015), Greater than the sum of its parts: What works in sustaining community-university partnerships, GMCVO, pp. 106-7.

The film and image library have also been used by the WEA for a variety of purposes (see feedback relating to these items under 'Creative and artistic products' from Howard Croft, WEA Projects Development manager). 

Valuing and supporting WEA adult learners
In the case study referred to above, Clare White discusses the apparent benefits for participants of taking part in group discussions or focus groups for the study: 

Last but not least, the study aims to make communities that are currently invisible and unrecognised for their contribution visible, as well as reflecting on their own experience. Feedback suggested that in some cases focus groups proved to be more beneficial for adult learners than one-on-one interviews, because they helped people realise that they are not alone with their problems.

From: Martikke, Susanne (2014), Mutual Recovery through Creative Connection: National Co-ordinating Centre for Public Engagement Public Engagement Case Study. Available:
https://www.publicengagement.ac.uk/case-studies/mutual-recovery-through-creative-connection

This point is also evidenced in the report from the study into community-university partnerships referred to above which featured the research. The extract below indicates as well how taking part in focus groups could sometimes supportive to the development of participants' creative identities:

A conversation during a joint interview with CUP partners who are collaborating on a research project about adult education suggests that co-production has wider benefits including for service users, partner organisations, as well as helping partners to come up with a more valid approach to research. The quote below illustrates that service users benefited from co-production by realizing that they as a group have shared concerns and experiences. () 

&amp;quot;Community partner: Yeah, and the peer model, the focus group sessions we did, I'm sure they sort of come to this conclusion anyway, but I think what they find helpful is realising that other people are in a similar situation, so a focus group rather than a kind of individual interview which they might, you know, obviously you have a dialogue with the interviewer which makes you think, but I think a lot of them sort of expressed the views that probably make them realise they're not alone, saying like they didn't feel like coming and it's been helpful and actually acknowledging each other's work and the talent they feel each other have got is a good extra, rather than simply being the tutor sitting in front of everyone, people supporting each other. So that's something that wouldn't necessarily come out [otherwise], because again they're only tiny courses, they're only an hour and a half and if you want to get your head down and do art , that can be the only thing that you don't necessarily think about.
Academic partner: That's right, yeah, and realising you're not alone and also that your experiences are part of a kind of wider socio political sort of issue as well.
()

Coming up with a more valid research approach, as in the example above, is one benefit of co-production but co-production can also help with the practical side of actually carrying out research in a practice context.

Outcomes:
Feedback from the CEO of CoolTan Arts, Michelle Baharier described the value of having researchers external to the organisation undertake a piece of in-depth evaluative research on their provision. Commenting on the interim report provided to the organisation (which reported solely on findings from the CoolTan provision studied) she stated that she would be keeping it on file for future use and, &amp;quot;Hope we do some of this in the future&amp;quot; (e-mail to Lydia Lewis, 14th April 2015). 
In addition, comments from participants on the interim research reports which detailed findings from each organisation separately not only validated findings but also indicated how the research had been helpful in providing group members with a feedback channel to their respective organisations as well as feelings of affirmation:

I had a coffee to wake me up and I read through your paper. I found it amazing how our sometimes casual conversation could actually be attributed to findings of various academics, and to make these connections can only come from lots of study and knowledge. 

I particularly agreed with your conclusions, that organisations such as Cooltan Arts are much needed, but are underfunded. Also that Cooltan Arts is only 'one part' of a larger jigsaw of services that are all very important, and much needed for people suffering some kind of mental distress. But that 'one part' of services that Cooltan Arts provide is an important factor in my life that helps to keep me well. I know from the many conversations that I have had with other participants that attend Cooltan Arts, that many of them feel the same way, and that Cooltan Arts helps to keep them well. 

I hope that ultimately that your paper will encourage people to help keep organisations such as Cooltan Arts open.

Comments were also received about the experience of having researchers taking part in the creative arts groups. One participant reflected:
It was nice having Jan in our poetry group and she learned that she is a good poet herself. I do hope we have inspired her to carry on writing poetry.

Comments from participants on the interim research reports which detailed findings from each organisation separately not only validated findings but also indicated how the research had been helpful in providing group members with a feedback channel to their respective organisations as well as feelings of affirmation:
Hope you are well. Just briefly read your Interim Report - all 32 pages of it - and am pleased that you managed to include everything. Well done. You must have put a lot of work into it and time. Anyway, thank you for representing the members' views really well.

The interim report for Studio Upstairs was well received by other members of the organisation too with feedback indicating it was found supportive to its work: 

I have read the report and have sent it to the trustees and to the Bristol studio team as it is an excellent piece of work!

To date, the blog has attracted more than 5,000 views and over 400 subscribers. During the last year, the CaSMa blog has posted more than 70 blogs, received many comments from followers (n&amp;gt;39) and several requests for guest posts (e.g. World Wide Web Foundation (webfoundation.org).
The blog is a valuable tool to publicize events, showcase current research projects and inform the public about current topics on social media research as well as provide a platform for the public to engage and communicate with the CaSMa team. For example, after the last public engagement event organised at Nottingham Contemporary, one of the attendees posted:

'Hello, I attended the most recent event. The event was organised masterfully and conducted with the utmost dignity and professionalism yet remained safe, supportive, engaging and thought provoking, it was &amp;quot;real&amp;quot;.

At the end of the debate I posed the question, &amp;quot;is the emerging phenomenon of digital interaction a window into Jung's collective unconscious.&amp;quot; This could be refined into a debate/exploration of virtual social groups and crowd consensus or dissension on the internet and perhaps their effects on the physical world.

please email me if you for further thoughts.'

Evidence that the CaSMa blog is reaching policy makers is evident from two occasions:
On December 7th 2015, following a blog post regarding the House of Lords inquiry into online platforms we were contacted:
Dear Dr Koene,
 I just noticed your short blog on the Lords inquiry into online platforms, particularly commenting on the question relating to algorithms.
Would you care to respond to our inquiry, on that one question? You clearly have a lot of expertise in this area. A page or two would be sufficient and would certainly enrich the debate.
The only issue is that we will stop accepting submissions on the 10th of this month.
Nevertheless, given that you have already more or less written it
Best,

On January 5th 2016, following blog posts on the draft Investigative Powers Bill we were contacted:
Dear Ansgar,
I work with the team leading on the Investigatory Powers Bill in the Home Office.
I hope you don't mind my approach, but we saw that you'd produced an analysis of the IP Bill on the CaSMa project blog site, and wondered if you might be interested in an informal discussion with officials working on the Bill. This could either be in London, or via phone if that were more convenient.
If you are interested in setting something up please do get in touch.
Best regards

This talk resulted in two of the leading figures in Open Dialogue in Nottingham for advancing the rights of people with mental health problems joining Professor Crawford's Centre for Social Futures at the Institute of Mental Health and subsequently creating a new Integrated Research Group in the centre called Open Futures. Open Futures has gone on to lead numerous public awareness raising events, not least MAD16 to launch Mental Health Awareness Week at the Institute of Mental Health which brought practitioners, researchers and service users together in a carnival celebration of mental health.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>545266008b8093.44852780</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>May 16	The Creative Researcher.

Recent developments in the health humanities in the UK

Brian Brown

&amp;quot;Medicine has advanced more in the last century than in all of previous history&amp;quot; (Altman, 2012) 

It isn't too difficult to think of examples of medical advance that support Altman's statement. Laboratory and clinical techniques have allowed health professionals to operate on parts of the body that would have seemed impossible to their forbears. Medicine has pushed back against infectious diseases, infant and maternal mortality and systemic ill health so we can look forward to longer lives with more quality adjusted life years than at any previous time in history. As a counterpoint to technological advance, in the last 40 or so years the medical humanities movement has been remarkably successful. Many universities throughout the world, especially where medicine is taught, have medical humanities departments and offer courses, conduct research and host conferences. However, it is timely and appropriate to address the increasing and broadening demand from other professions to become involved, and to accommodate new sectors of the healthcare workforce and the public. There are important cohorts of personnel in health care, as well as many ancillary workers, informal carers and patients themselves who have been largely left out of the medical humanities so far. There are many nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, practitioners of creative therapies, health care assistants, social workers and many others who have at one time or another drawn upon the creative disciplines, the humanities and the arts. In this speech I shall examine some of the activities which colleagues and I have undertaken in the UK as part of our Creative Practice as Mutual Recovery project, to illustrate these trends. I shall also explore some of the emerging evidence, from our projects and several others to show how the body - for example the immune system and patterns of brain activation - can be seen to respond to creative, artistic or humanities-focussed interventions. The humanities and arts are therefore enabling us to rethink age-old questions about the relationship between the mind and the body.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b16f7872a313.11724552</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Making Music for Mental Health, at the International Association for Music and Medicine Conference (Toronto, Canada)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D4868E28-4E55-4005-84CC-DEF5EAFE3D7F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The presentation showcased the work in progress on Making Music for Mental Health, and sparked questions and discussion afterwards.

The research also provided examples that were used in a subsequent lecture to the groups on 'The politics, ethics and uses of social research'. This stimulated questions about the ethical approaches the students were taking in their own research projects and about the ethics of social research in general, including in relation to matters of epistemic responsibility.

The following extract is drawn from a National Co-ordinating Centre for Public Engagement case study based on the project:

The research is carried out by Lydia, together with a trained researcher who identifies as a survivor of a mental health issues and services. Clare's main role is as an intermediator between the learners, the tutors and the researchers, ensuring that everyone has the information they need. Clare also co-facilitated and observed focus groups to assist learners with these, at the same time learning about research techniques. Participating in the steering group meetings has enabled Clare to reconnect to the theory behind much of what the WEA does and how it links to debates in feminism, sociology and politics.

The WEA's feedback from the exercise demonstrates how it also informed the development of the organisation's health education provision: 

&amp;quot;The Mental Wellbeing Impact Assessment was a useful process for us in assessing the impact an additional course had for our students. It gave us a structure to collect evidence about aspects like how involved students felt and what impact course activities had on their lives. We found that increasing the number of sessions to two a week made it a bigger part of learners' lives and we have found an improvement in attendance and retention. It also gave us feedback to act upon in terms of course timings which we addressed the following term.

We enjoyed working as part of a team and particularly appreciated the time that was spent drawing together the findings from this focus group and our wider data with local public health data from a number of sources. This kind of wider review is something that we rarely have the opportunity to do mid-project and helps us to put the work and learning on the ground into a wider context.&amp;quot;

Re: MWIA report
&amp;quot;Many thanks for sending me a copy of this. It is really interesting reading and relevant to me as I have responsibility for developing community learning provision in Stoke-on-Trent. I had hoped that there would be more 'cross-pollination' from the CHEST project into the community provision and your report highlights the need to establish more opportunities for progression as a means of further benefiting these learning groups. 
I am pleased that you will continue your links with the WEA through the Rugeley Study Centre.&amp;quot;

Lydia Lewis instigated training in Mental Wellbeing Impact Assessment (MWIA) in liaison with the WEA, who had expressed an interest in this, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust and the Public Health Observatory in Birmingham. Five WEA staff members took part, with additional participants being drawn from other third and public sector organisations. The training involved conducting an assessment of a women's health course in Stoke-on-Trent which formed part of a programme called CHEST - Community Education in Stoke-on-Trent. A half day workshop was conducted with course participants and this gave experience to WEA staff members in co-facilitating such an event.
