For many, this stage in their lives corresponds with a transition into illegality as they become no longer eligible for support services dedicated to 'children', and reach the end of their legal right to remain in the UK. Many disengage from institutions in order to decrease the risk of being forcibly removed to their countries of origin. Some may migrate on to other parts of Europe or, if returned to a country of origin, may subsequently come back to Europe. Even if they stay in the UK, being labelled an 'adult' usually means a drop in entitlements with respect to access to education, housing and other welfare services. 
 Innovative and participatory in nature, this research addresses a significant gap in our understanding of what happens to young people subject to immigration control once they 'become adult'. It explores young people's own conceptions of their futures, how these are formed and the factors which affect their ability to realise these future plans over time. This is the first ever attempt to systematically investigate the longer term wellbeing outcomes for young people subject to immigration control in the UK once they turn 18. The research prioritises the intersection between wellbeing and futures and addresses the following questions: 
1. How do young people 'becoming adult' while subject to immigration control in the UK conceptualise and seek to realise their future plans over time? 
2. In what ways are young people subject to immigration control influenced in how they conceptualise and seek to realise their future plans by the cultural norms and social networks with which they interact over time and place? 
3. Given the pre-established association between a well defined future and a sense of wellbeing, how do processes of immigration control impact on young people's wellbeing outcomes over time? 
4. What policy implications emerge from an analysis of the synergy/ dissonance between policies governing the outcomes for young people subject to immigration control and their lived experiences of 'becoming adult'? 
 Bringing together sociological, anthropological and social policy modes of inquiry, the study combines: in-depth longitudinal research with young people subject to immigration control from four countries (Afghanistan, Eritrea, Vietnam and Albania); a critical analysis of culturally embedded understandings of futures and wellbeing (and their associations with migration and 'adulthood') in four country contexts; an analysis of relevant immigration and asylum policies and their applications; a measure of wellbeing (using objective and subjective indicators) over time; and the building of a national profile of outcomes for young people subject to immigration control as they make the transition to adulthood. A key methodological innovation is the involvement of young people subject to immigration control as central members of the research team throughout the course of the project. 
 By critically juxtaposing young people's lived experiences of migration and their associated cultural attachments with immigration control policies, this work examins the relevance of such policies, their likely efficacy and their impact on young people's wellbeing. A range of academic outputs will be supplemented by additional policy outputs including: a set of policy and practice guidelines for supporting young adults subject to immigration control of international relevance; an accredited training programme in research methods completed by 10 young adults who are/ have been subject to immigration control; an international Europe-wide policy conference; a set of educational materials for schools and colleges; and a participatory art project as a medium for disseminating key research findings.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research promises economic and societal impact at local, national and international levels. It will benefit policy makers, practitioners, the general public; and, through their direct participation, the main beneficiaries: young people who are or have been subject to immigration control. 
 Firstly, the project will build the capacity of young people subject to immigration control by: a) developing the research, analysis and communication skills of a group of research apprentices; b) engaging an additional group of young people as members of a project advisory group; and c) directly involving young people in the dissemination of research findings to help inform policy and practice. This will include the creation of a set of internationally relevant policy and practice guidelines for supporting young adults subject to immigration control. 
 Secondly, the work will benefit policy makers and practitioners by generating: a) the first national quantitative database on the outcomes of unaccompanied minors leaving care; and b) an authoritative evidence base on the lived experiences of young people becoming adult while subject to immigration control. There is an established yet poorly understood disconnect between the ways in which future options for these young people are institutionalised in policy terms and the aspirations and strategies which they pursue themselves. Our findings will inform policies which can better safeguard young people's wellbeing as they make the transition to 'adulthood' and have greater relevance to the realities of young peoples' experiences of 'becoming adult' within immigration controls. Through the coordinating role of a Young People Subject to Immigration Control In Transition working group, the research will influence the work of several UK government departments, leading ultimately to the proposition of more evidence-based, reflective policy which is economically and politically viable. The high financial and emotional costs of forced removals, rather than voluntary returns, are illustrative of how policies might be better informed through this work. 
 The work also has relevance for stakeholders internationally, specifically in Europe, where policies affecting young migrants in transition to 'adulthood' are much criticised (Hammerberg 2010) and where thousands of young people await the outcomes of legal processes, unable or unwilling to return home and forced to plan for multiple possible futures. In particular the research will inform efforts to protect the human rights of migrants, including by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Given young migrants' right to a 'durable solution' with respect to the outcome of their migration (UN Committee on the Rights of the Child 2005), findings from this work will shed further light on possible alternative futures outcomes for young people which may not yet previously have been considered in policy terms. 
 On-going collaboration with our European partners as part of a planned comparative research programme will ensure the work's wider resonance. Its replicable methodology will shift political debate across Europe beyond the 'child/'adult' migrant binary towards closer attention to the transition between these two phases in life, a debate likely to benefit young people subject to immigration control the world over. 
 Thirdly, recognising how public opinion influences policy debates, the research will produce two educational outreach programmes and make extensive use of public and social media channels to engage the public in measured debate about youth migration. This will benefit society as a whole, helping to promote social cohesion through increased societal understanding of the circumstances of young people subject to immigration control; and facilitating the inclusion of an important number of young people at risk of social and political marginalisation.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>656923</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Booklet and art exhibition at New Walk museum</gtr:description><gtr:id>5F906307-142A-45F6-81BF-A9488A2CE73D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Encouraged participation in the research project, helped to give skills and achievements to research participants and raised awareness among the general public about the experiences of young refugees</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6d1df674687.50445211</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>'Together: A Retrospective of Art by Young Refugees'</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://refugeeweek.org.uk/events/together-a-retrospective-of-art-by-young-refugees/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>'Nightlife' is a theatre for Social Justice production by the Oxford-based Mandala Theatre Company .

A series of 8 artistic workshops were run by Jennifer Allsopp with 6 unaccompanied minors in Rome, Italy hosted by Centro Astalli's Aver Drom reception centre on the theme of transformation. The theme drew on the Transformers art exhibition curated by Hou Haru and Anne Palopoli and in particular the artwork 'Disarm' by the Mexican artist Pedro Reyes which sees weapons transformed into musical instruments. The workshops included visits to the MAXXI modern art museum and Pigorini Ethnographic museum, in particular the exhibition of African weapons. The project culminated in a performance of narrations themed around the topic of personal and political transformations which were developed by the young people around some of their artistic creations and their responses to the museums. Their artistic outputs included 2D and 3D media such as painting, drawing, origami and sculpture. The final narrations took place at the MAXXI on Education Day in front of the Transformers exhibit with an audience of approximately 75 people including representatives from the Italian Ministry for Culture and the Italian Ministry for Integration. 
The project took place in collaboration with SWICH Sharing a World of Inclusion, Creativity and Heritage which is supported by Creative Europe 2014-2018 of the European Union. The idea of the project is to involve museums in creating reflections on the themes of citizenship and belonging in contemporary Europe.</gtr:description><gtr:id>896D04DF-2FF1-4246-83AD-46D11DA04037</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Confidence building for the young people, a site of exchange and understanding between unaccompanied minors and general public during the final narrations and through the production of a book bringing together the narrations with the young people's artwork.
