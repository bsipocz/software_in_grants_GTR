These groups often struggle to establish collaborative partnerships with other groups in the same region, particularly across religious differences. Launched with AHRC/ESRC funding in 2013, the Ancestral Time (AT) project is the most sustained empirical study of religious environmentalism to date. It was precisely with these barriers in mind that we sought to develop a more nuanced account of how and why religious groups mobilise around environmental issues in Scotland. Over the course of conversations with third sector practitioners we became aware that a lack of understanding around possible &amp;quot;common ground&amp;quot; served as a barrier to collaboration between secular and religious community groups on areas of common concern. These groups often have overlapping purposes and stakeholders, but can struggle to bridge differences in language and narrative concerning environmental care. We have also found that there is a significant desire to collaborate with community-level environmental practitioners by major British environmental charities (especially WWF and RSPB), Scottish government agencies and businesses targeting sustainability.

This follow-on project seeks to mobilise the new knowledge generated in the AT project among new audiences. In collaboration with representatives from our project partner Eco-Congregation Scotland, we will seek to address the existing gap in understanding through a series of 7 separate regionally-hosted participatory workshops. Each workshop will draw together representatives in a different region from a range of local community groups for a participatory discussion in the form of &amp;quot;open space&amp;quot; (Owen, 2008; Chambers, 2011). At each workshop representatives from each practitioner group, including Eco-Congregation Scotland will be invited to share the story behind their work. Aspects of group dynamics will be illuminated through brief presentations by project researchers. The overarching goal will be to find common ground, bridging apparent differences and finding common language and strategic goals around which secular and religious groups can cooperate on environmental care. Participants will be invited to work together to identify resources, barriers, and 'shared ground'. The project researcher will keep a record of these discussions in order to generate a series of case studies which can provide the basis for a collaboratively authored summary of best-practices for community-level collaborations on environmental issues in Scotland, highlighting possible ways for secular and religious groups to find 'shared ground'.

The final symposium, to be hosted at the University of Edinburgh, will draw on participants from the seven workshops and the research team to present case studies and best practices to an audience including scholarly researchers, civil servants, local authorities, leaders of environmental charities and representatives from the business sector who provide technology and finance to communities involved in sustainable initiatives. The symposium will emphasize participation and collaboration through select plenary addresses, &amp;quot;open space,&amp;quot; short oral presentations, and world caf&amp;eacute; style discussion. Not only will this project generate new partnerships to address climate change mitigation efforts in Scotitsh communities, but it will also help third sector groups to generate new understanding of roadblocks to collaboration and modes of environmental action which our team will feed back to the research community. By drawing academic practitioners into engagement with well-informed practitioner group representatives we expect to generate a new research nexus between the fields of religious studies, human geography, social anthropology, and sociology around grounded research of grassroots environmental activism in a religious context.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will promote new collaborations among third sector environmental practitioner groups, illuminate new areas for research in environmental mobilisation studies and generate models for creative academic / third sector partnerships in sustainability studies. Pathways through which we will realize project impact include the following:

Religious communities and third sector environmental groups: there is a wide range of opinion in religious communities towards the environment, and a lack of clarity regarding the possible benefits which these communities might bring to environmental problems. This project will highlight the possible positive impacts that can be contributed by religious communities in facing environmental change and crisis and in so doing create the possibility of increased investment on the part of these groups. We will also help religious communities recognise possible areas of collaboration with other local secular environmental groups. Other third sector environmental groups in turn have expressed increasing interest in engagement with religious groups on matters of climate change advocacy and conservation work particularly after the strong input from faith communities in the COP21 summit in Paris and the general public reaction to the recent encyclical on the environment by Pope Francis. By highlighting the range of work underway in religious environmental groups and highlighting areas both of unique contribution and common concern we expect that third other third sector environmental groups will be emboldened to pursue collaborations with the large number of religious groups already involved in environmental care in Scotland.

Business and finance: Scottish finance and business is uniquely strong in sustainability and towards this end, but resources and collaborations can tend to be strongest on a National level. Through this project we will highlight the range of resources and initiatives underway in community groups and draw new levels of attention to the local level as a possible area for collaborative partnership towards sustainable investment and development.

Policy-makers: there are a number of government initiatives which fund in whole or part religious environmental groups as part of a broader behavior change agenda. By clarifying the role and agency of these groups in responding to environmental change, we will provide new contexts for engagement by policymakers with this part of the public.

Media and public awareness: coverage of religious groups on environmental issues has been either minimal or largely negative. By publicizing the workshops, symposium, and disseminating our findings in the form of best-practices we will provide a new perspective to media sources regarding the possibility of partnerships across secular and religious groups. Throughout the project we will seek to extend the reach of our findings to interested members of the public by engaging local and national broadcast and print media related to the events and activities.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>79127</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Researcher led workshop for Scottish Government civil servants and policy makers, Victoria Quay, Leith</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6EC9165F-8CEC-4CBB-A737-3B2FC2DEFE68</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Northcott and Kidwell led a one hour presentation and discussion with civil servants responsible for climate change and communities and energy policy in Victoria Quay, Scottish government civil service site. The presentation shared the conclusions outlined under narrative elsewhere in research fish,and additional conclusions. The main findings as shared were as follows:

We report on a UK government funded research project of Scotland's largest network of communities engaged in environmental education and behavioural change, Ecocongregations Scotland. We conducted research in 20% of network churches, including sixty in depth interviews, and achieved a good geographical spread from Orkney and North Uist to the lowland cities and the Borders. Our principal findings:

Almost all churches in the network had an 'eco' pioneer who formed a 'green group' which encouraged church members and the kirk session to engage in environmental behaviours and educational activities to raise awareness.

Environmental behaviours stimulated by 'green groups' included installation of low energy church lighting; church collections of batteries, printer cartridges and other post-consumer waste not well managed by local government; turning down church heating; draft proofing / insulating church buildings; changing church and household energy accounts to renewable energy providers; providing annual audits for church building and members of their carbon footprints; encouraging car sharing for church meetings; holding public-facing environmental educational events on climate change etc; engaging church members in community gardening, beach or river bed clean-ups; visiting primary schools to give talks about caring for the environment; investigating and installing renewable energy for church heating and electricity such as biomass boilers and rooftop solar and small wind turbines.
Church of Scotland churches more inclined to join the Ecocongregations network than others; Ecocongregations offices located in CofS HQ in 121 George street; CofS is more lay led than other churches so a lay green champion is able to form a green group, present reports and proposals to the kirk session without formal appointment by a salaried clergy person. 
Location of church in local communities provides a public space for environmental engagement and for community mobilisation around projects such as environmental clean-ups, community gardening, car sharing. 

Some used environmental engagement as a way of extending the appeal of the church in a social context of declining interest in religion, including engagement of younger families. 
Potential of churches as community eco-pioneers is under-realised. Very few had PV installations or visible exterior markers of pro-environmental values or behaviours. But we obtained limited evidence that where the church had led on e.g. PV installation, its visibility prompted householder installations.
Environmental values in the network included: 
intention to preserve a stable climate and rich biodiversity for future generations;
intention to mitigate suffering from climate change already being experienced by poor farmers in developing world countries with strong church links such as Malawi;
desire for churches to lead broader political and economic environmental behaviours - for example by divesting pension funds from fossil fuel companies;
individual empowerment towards pro-environmental behaviours through community engagement evidenced in belief that small actions by individuals when copied by others in the same residential community have greater collective impacts than when individuals act alone.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c01ebbbda126.72791979</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/P005063/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FE33AE51-7085-4BCA-8B2F-66C86B855F25</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Theology, divinity &amp; religion</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>35CC531E-67B1-44F7-83DF-824B0C49CF9E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Contemporary Religion</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F6DEB3C9-18A0-4A06-87C5-8C347DF98C60</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environmental Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1AB3F721-B2D1-4875-A568-E7F49B4465E9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B429D0DD-8AFA-4BA0-86CB-0857E81FC4B6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology of Religion</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
