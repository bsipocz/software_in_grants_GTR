The patterns approach was picked up by the software engineering community who also had the problem of capturing and passing on the skills that made the difference between a raw Computer Science graduate and an experienced programmer.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The great thing about patterns is that they bridge the gap between theoretical, general, academic models of systems and behaviour, and the individual cases or war stories. They help to draw out the lessons learned through experience, with a richer description and understanding of the context within which problems have occurred and how they might be solved or avoided in the future. The goal of this project is to develop a collection of patterns that can be used to capture the lived experience of project and programme managers (PPM). These can then be shared, developed and discussed within the PPM community, leading to a better understanding of the pitfalls and problems, together with the ways to avoid or recover, and their consequences.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We will conduct six workshops to find the most effective ways to elicit patterns from practitioners, and create a professional website to enable them to be shared by the community.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Improvements in the national infrastructure, whether roads, national IT networks, railways, are vital to the success and growth of a nation's economy. Successful major sporting events have benefited the UK's perceived success around the world, as well as creating a sense of national pride and achievement. All these rely for their successful outcomes on programme managers. By improving the skills of programme managers in the UK, this project will benefit the UK taxpayer. By improving the training, skills and insight of the managers of major programmes, this project will benefit taxpayers, by leading to more efficient use of public money in major government-funded projects. Furthermore, for private sector major projects, this project will help programme managers make better decisions, which should help companies and businesses to avoid losses.

Project and Programme managers will benefit from this project since they will increase their skills and insight by having a new structure that will bring together their own experiences, supported by a framework that links process and outcome. They will be encouraged to think about project successes and disasters in a structured way, to publish their insights, and to share and discuss them with colleagues. The workshop events will encourage a collegiate atmosphere, based on mutual trust, and enable participants to network and extend their links within their professional community. The Patterns website will initially be accessible to workshop and invited participants only, so that the ideas can be tested and developed safely, but if the project is successful, we will open the website to other project and programme managers, and make the findings available to them through a book of patterns and a course. Articles in professional magazines, talks a local events and conference presentations will alert project managers to this project, so that they may contribute to the development of the PPM pattern language. 

Academics will also benefit from this project, since they will possibly have another approach to gathering data from professional communities and other communities of expertise. These should be useful for theory-building and as a means of rapid dissemination of research findings to practitioners. The outcomes of this project will be disseminated to academics through conference and journal articles. Interested academics will be invited to the end-of-project event, so that they may observe the pattern generation process in practice, and feed back their comments through a questionnaire and short interviews. This benefit will not be limited to academics working in project and programme management, since it is likely that this approach would be of use to social scientists working in many management fields who study practice on site. This could include those working on change management, operations management, governance, and organisational behaviour, for example. At the end of the project, the website will seek follow-on funding, and will be accessible to interested academics. A book and course materials will be proposed at the end of this short project, and these resources will ultimately be available to colleagues too.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>14038</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>My findings have been included in the MSc in Major Programme Management, where they may have been taken up by course participatns.
