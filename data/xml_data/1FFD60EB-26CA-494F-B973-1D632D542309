The project aims to establish the impact of romanticism and picturesque theory across the built environment, the spectrum of English (excluding Scotland, Ireland, Wales) domestic architecture including the anonymous and everyday. The project will tease out the theoretical, formal and cultural threads that precipitated the invention of the traditional 'English' house and will seek to assess its impact upon the English built environment. Prior to nineteenth century pan-European national historicism, the Arts and Crafts Movement and twentieth-century inter-war Mock-Tudor, traditionalism in British housing design first emerged out of the architectural theory and design practice of national romanticism and the rural picturesque: 'a manifestation of the nation's coming to being as a system of cultural significance within modernity' (Bhabha, 1990). These intellectual movements responded to the Enlightenment's universalist progressive rationalism and the social and environmental changes of the agricultural and industrial revolutions, rural flight and urban growth, through a new cultural reverence for a notional rural past as a place of national identity. In architectural design, this romantic conception of nationhood was (is) represented through the reproduction of the forms, materials and construction details of traditional rural buildings. The picturesque celebrated the irregularity and variety of vernacular buildings and took an amoral aesthetic pleasure in scenes of rural poverty and material decay (Macarthur, 1997). Proto-romantic English theories of the picturesque such as Udevale Price's Essay on the Picturesque sought to emphasise the specific aesthetics of place, including local building traditions, over universal, European, standards of taste. British National Romanticism further emphasised the significance of place in the formation of cultural identity and looked to rural folk traditions, including cottages, mills and farmhouses, as a source of inspiration and place of salvation (Curran, 2007; Porter and Teich, 1988). Modernity and tradition were fused in a set of complex interrelationships characterized by ambiguity and fluidity and tradition has subsequently maintained a presence within post-romantic modernity; what Ananda Roy has described as the 'corrupting impact of history upon modernity' (Roy, 2000). Tradition can be better understood not in terms of opposition but as a creative, adaptive and reflective process within modernity (Asquith and Vellinga, 2006; Bronner, 2006). Tradition in Early Modernity is an original interdisciplinary research project that will draw upon literary studies, cultural theory, vernacular (folk) studies, and architectural and design history; cross-referencing contemporary critical writings on tradition, identity and place with eighteenth/nineteenth century primary sources within a fieldwork-based historical study. Research will be divided between the archival study of treatises and pattern books at the British Library and field studies of extant houses (with particular reference to the South West which saw extensive estate and early suburban villa building activity in this period; to be compared with suburban villas of early industrial northern cities). While including the works of relevant architects it is a study of the invention of an 'English' domestic architecture not a conventional canonical study. The project will link current research on the eighteenth (Design History, 2009) and twentieth centuries (TDSR and JAE, 2009) and bring to fruition the wider project: Tradition in Modernity, 1700 - 2000.\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Through collaboration with heritage sector practitioners and government agencies throughout the development and implementation of the research, the range of outputs (reports, journal papers, conference) will be specifically tailored to reach beyond academia and benefit professionals within the heritage sector and the historic built environment, and will inform and contribute to regional and national heritage management practice and policy (conservation architects, planners, policy development, building developers, museum curators, historic building inspectorate): \n\nArchitectural heritage industry audience through publication of 8000 word-length article in leading research journal in the field: Design History and/or Architecture History: 2011/12.\n\nNational impact on government heritage bodies (English Heritage) through production and dissemination of 'advice notes' (2000-words) on the identification and interpretation of romantic-picturesque architecture (to be developed in collaboration with English Heritage (West of England): 2011 onwards.\n\nRegional impact through dissemination of research to National Trust South West using close links with the National Trust South West through the MA Eighteenth Century programme (scholarship scheme for NT curatorial staff, dissertations supervised by curators at NT properties).

The typical English sururban house is designed to convey the idea of the cottage: a simple, traditional rural retreat.



The idea of the cottage has had a profound influence on English culture and lies at the heart of our attitudes and expectations of home and the house as well as our relationship with the countryside.



The project focussed not on traditional or vernacular cottage - 'real' cottages - but on buildings designed by architects to look like cottages, objects that communicate an idea of an idealic cottage-life. 



Extensive research was conducted at the British Library examining architectural writings on cottage architecture from the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. This was combined with fieldwork across England.



The project findings were that the idea of the cottage, the origins of the English house are located much earlier than previously thought in the romantic period of the early nineteenth century but in the eighteenth century, tracing back to Dryden's translation of Virgil in the late seventeenth century and the transposing of Virgil's georgic rural ideal to cottage design in the mid to late eighteenth century.



The second finding, is that this design discourse began specifically in relation to the small social group of so-called 'gentlemen of taste and fortune' a cogniscenti of art lovers, landscape designers, architects and large estate owners. 



It was this small, elitist group that the idea of the cottage escaped into the mainstream of English domestic architecture in the later nineteenth century, finally emerging as the standard suburban housing type in the twentieth century.



A second strand of research emerged through the project concerning the incompleteness of vernacular architecture and its implications in terms of architectural theories of use and occupation. This resulted in the conference Fixed? in 2011 and is soon to be published in the edited collected Consuming Architecture (Routledge, 2013)</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>BooK; The Idea of the Cottage in English Architecture to be published in 2015. This is expected to find a wide, interested readership outside of academic.



Specific site investigations produced research that is valuable to the understanding and presentation of those specific sites by local agencies, authorities. Simple Advice Notes have been prepared for relevant authorities on the presentation/understanding of buildings/sites in their care. eg. Sidmouth (Devon County Council), Mount Edgcumbe (Plymouth City Council).
