He is distinguished by the range of projects he has worked on, the directors he has collaborated with, and his development of novel approaches to the creation of film music. His output includes scores for the groundbreaking animatronic films of Jim Henson ('The Dark Crystal', 1982; 'Labyrinth', 1986), films with significant cultural impact such as 'Brassed Off!' (1996) and 'Notting Hill' (1999), and those dealing with political issues both in the UK and abroad. The latter include 'In the Name of the Father' (1993) which investigates the wrongful arrest and treatment of the Guildford Four, and 'Mississippi Burning' (1988), which deals with the struggles of black civil-rights activists and the Ku Klux Klan in the southern US in the 1960s. Many of the films he has scored retain currency and continue to appear regularly on British television schedules many years after their theatrical releases.

Jones has been active in an industry that has experienced a prolonged period of major technological change, including the switchover from analogue to digital production and post-production techniques, and developments in computer software for score production and sound recording/editing. In the audio sphere, this period saw the development of the digital audio workstation, the digital synthesizer and other electronic instruments that significantly impacted on the collaborative process of film-score production. Jones has been in the vanguard in his use of such technology and continues to operate at the forefront of the profession.

In 2005 Jones donated a very large collection of materials relating to his film scores to the University of Leeds, which already had an established reputation for film-music study, with an agreement that they may be used exclusively for research and teaching. The donation consisted of more than 400 multi-track analogue tapes, including session recordings and demonstration mock-ups of cues, as well as an array of paperwork such as spotting notes, mixer settings and other records of communication between members of the music and production teams, and Jones has continued to add to the holdings through the provision of digital files for recent film projects, and notated scores (which often include drafts and sketches). In 2010 he made a second donation of archival materials, around 300 items, including rough and fine cuts for several pictures (on video), additional multi-track and demo recordings, and some final mixes.

The approach to scholarly investigation of film music and its composers has developed over time as researchers have gained access to resources that permit more detailed study, progressing from the aural analysis of the music as heard in the theatrical release of a film to the use of additional materials to supplement the soundtrack, notably the composers' manuscript scores. Continuing this development, the value of archival resources relating to the film-score production process has recently begun to be recognised by researchers, since these materials can often establish the context of the notated score, enabling scholars to evaluate previous incarnations of musical ideas and structures, and to chart the ways in which musical and filmic decisions have impacted on the composer's music. The proposed project will utilise the Jones Archive to create public events, educational materials, a monograph on Jones (the first significant publication devoted to the composer) that investigates and evaluates key phases in his career within the context of developments in both the British and global film-music industries, conference papers and proceedings, a PhD dissertation, and a digital archive of materials relating to Jones's film work for use in research and teaching (as per the University's agreement with Jones).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>COMMERCIAL SECTOR: Likely commercial-sector beneficiaries include film composers, orchestrators and others in the film-music business. Additionally, those in the film industry, both in the UK and internationally, may be interested in the research since it will enable them to reflect on the development of their own practises and procedures in a rapidly changing industry. Music is perhaps the part of film production least well understood by directors and production companies, and the findings of this project will shed new light on the changing processes, procedures and requirements of the business of film-scoring in the UK. Accordingly, the research will strengthen the position and competitiveness of UK film and those working within the industry (directors, production companies, composers, orchestrators, etc.) within the global marketplace, by helping to develop new insights, ways of working and understanding of what happens during this phase of film production. Musicians employed in other collaborative professional contexts such as musical theatre (in its various guises) or ensemble performance (be it classical or otherwise) are also likely to be interested in, and benefit from this research. The project's repository framework may also be of value to professionals in the arts for the secure storage and use of their own materials.

PUBLIC SECTOR: The project will capitalise on impact opportunities provided by neighbouring Bradford's status as UNESCO's first City of Film, and the CI has met with David Wilson, Director of City of Film (CoF), and Michael Terwey, the Deputy Director and Head of Public Programmes at Bradford's National Media Museum (NMM) in this regard. CoF (http://bradford-city-of-film.co.uk/) is keen to integrate some of the research findings into its education work with high school children through its 'Learn' agenda, and also to assist with communicating the importance of the findings to film-makers (as outlined above) via its 'Make' strategy. The NMM is a large regional public-sector organisation, and discussions have centred around large-scale, high-profile events to be held as part of the 2015 Bradford International Film Festival (BIFF). These events, which will link into the Museum's existing cultural and educational programme, will bring the research findings to widespread public attention, and will also help the NMM achieve its stated aim of being the best museum in world for inspiring people to learn about, engage with and create media (see http://www.nationalmediamuseum.org.uk/AboutUs.aspx). Initial discussions have also taken place between the CI and both the Leeds International Film Festival (LIFF) and the British Film Institute (BFI), the latter of which is the lead body for film in the UK, regarding exhibitions and events held as part of their respective film festivals based on the project materials, research and findings. Additionally, the materials created in conjunction with CoF may be of interest to the BFI, which runs a series of educational programmes and schemes and also provides resources for primary and secondary teaching.

WIDER PUBLIC: Film is a global enterprise, and the consumption of film is a part of British culture; similarly, the British film industry has been in existence for over 100 years in various forms, and has become a part of our cultural heritage. The wider public will benefit directly from this project through the events run in conjunction with the LIFF, the NMM as part of BIFF2015, and at the BFI, as outlined above. These public events will bring cultural and social benefits to attendees and develop awareness of the way in which the film industry operates within the UK, as well as increasing public knowledge and quality of life. The events will offer a new dimension to the Film Festivals, which normally focus primarily on the visual aspects of film, helping to increase visitor numbers to Leeds, Bradford and London and boosting the economy.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>466855</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Pre-screening Presentation to Screening of 'Labyrinth' at the National Media Museum</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>49662795-1C3E-40F8-99C3-3454B2EB8A8B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Pre-screening presentation, 'Exploring the Labyrinth' delivered before a film screening at the National Media Museum.

Members of the project team co-delivered an introduction to film music techniques and processes, the compositional style of Trevor Jones, and the functions of music in two 1990s British film comedies, 'Brassed Off' and 'Notting Hill'. This choice of these films supported the class's curriculum, examining film comedy and developed their interest in film music composition. 

Students reported positive feedback from the class, particularly highlighting how the explanation of the archive and research methods for film would be useful in their own case studies, 'it has provided me with skills to analyse how sound in British films can enhance &amp;quot;Britishness&amp;quot;'. Other comments included, the session 'has broadened my impression of what research should be', 'helps me talk more about the style of music used in film'; '[in future] I will be listening for how music changes throughout a film'; and 'now I will think about and look at films more critically'.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b3fe3d440414.83980201</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation by members of the project team at Bradford College, 'Trevor Jones's Compositional Approaches: An Overview'</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>28F98644-0925-46E6-A386-A74C10F20A7E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>12 pupils at Bradford College attended a three-hour presentation entitled 'Trevor Jones's Compositional Approaches: An Overview'. Drawing on digitised archival materials, the presentation introduced the film score production process, the Trevor Jones Archive at the University of Leeds, and some of Jones's compositional approaches, notably his 'toolkit method' of layering sounds to create atmospheric scores, his use of pre-existing music in film composition, and differences between his approach to film and television. 

The session sparked questions and debate among the students, most of whom are studying composition themselves. All students reported positive feedback on the session with several composition students noting that they would employ the 'toolkit method' in their own work. One student reported that this will help 'the music to sound very professional, something I've been struggling with'. Another said that the 'toolkit method's cherry-picking of textures is something I would like to try out'.

Other comments included: '[the session] opened my mind to how films are scored' and 'I'll focus more closely on the use of existing music and how the composer uses that within a score'.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b3fa344e5272.56701384</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Undergraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Curious Encounters: The Audio-Visual Archive</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9CC4BE07-8C9C-47F4-87A3-714499745D6D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Pop up exhibit at the Stanley and Audrey Burton art gallery offered researchers from the university the opportunity to showcase their research projects and to engage with the public on a one to one basis.

Engagement with the project research has enhanced the educational experience of school and college students, whose knowledge of film, music, and the cultural relevance and significance of each has been deepened through the experience. The resulting effect of this is greater critical understanding of this aspect of the British creative and cultural industries, as well as the development of the skill-set of these students, potentially improving their future career and employment prospects.

Private and public events relating to project research on specific films have enabled attendees (including amateur film-makers as well as film and film-music enthusiasts) to gain a more detailed understanding of the industrial and artistic practices that underpin the creation of music for professional film and television productions, championing the role of this part of the creative industries within British culture.

The project has also resulted in some modest inter-cultural knowledge exchange through small-scale activity with Japanese students. 

It is still too early to assess the overall impact of the project website and the digital materials that it enables access to.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>EB332AA2-FAD2-4A12-BB28-7717FD47CA1A</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54523e0ff06ed3.06331919</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The research funded on this grant has generated significant new knowledge of film and television composer Trevor Jones and his working methods. Jones is seen as a distinguished figure within the film-music industry, but until this project was largely overlooked within scholarly considerations of film music, despite him scoring a large number of pictures over a thirty-plus-year career. This project was the first detailed exploration of his career and output, and the research has not only brought Jones and his work to greater light in the eyes of both scholars and the public, but has also influenced other scholarship and research into film scoring and film-score production since the late 1970s.

The research has also resulted in significant development in scholarly understanding of production processes and technologies in music for film and television. Through digitisation of the audio, video, textual and musical (notation) materials in the Trevor Jones Archive, the research team (and other scholars) have been able to interrogate aspects of the film-score-production process from novel perspectives that have generated significant new knowledge in the field of film musicology. The research has also provided possibly the first opportunity to consider in detail the ways in which compositional practices and the use of technology have developed and also relate to each other across the last thirty to forty years, a period which has seen significant changes in film-making, the sound of film scores, and the technologies and technical processes that underpin both of these areas.

New skills in audio-visual archival work have been developed by the project team that have wider application beyond the project materials and can have significant impact across the scholarly community. Notably, the metadata schema created and developed through the project is the first of its kind. The schema consists of around ninety fields designed to capture in detail a very wide range of information relating to an individual item in the audio-visual archive, whether it be an audio, video, textual or musical (notation) resource. Furthermore, the schema has been created in such a way as to facilitate the connecting of resources through metadata being shared across items (such as an audio recording and a corresponding item of paperwork, for example).

The project's bespoke front-end website, www.screenmusic.leeds.ac.uk, utilises the detailed metadata relating to the archival materials to enable them to be searched and used effectively. The website is a ground-breaking new resource, giving scholars and the public scholars hitherto unprecedented access to information on materials relating to the film- and television-score production process, and opening up a wealth of information with significant value for research and teaching, as well as potentially being of general interest to fans of film and film music.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>As described in the original proposal, the archive methodology (in particular the metadata schema) and its content are likely to be of interest to those working in the creative industries and heritage sectors, and particularly to professionals in the film and film-music industries.
