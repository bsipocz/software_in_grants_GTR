&lt;p>This projects aims to bridge the gap between abstract macroeconomic models and actual macroeconomic policymaking. To achieve this, the project will develop a simple and realistic theory of macroeconomic fluctuations. There are three features of modern economies that policymakers must contend with but that are not at the core of most modern models: unemployment, widespread inequality in wealth and income, and the influence of consumption behavior and aggregate demand on the economy. To remedy these absences, the proposed theory will account for unemployment arising both from matching frictions and from a lack of jobs in the economy. The theory will also embed consumption functions and aggregate demand, in the spirit of Keynes. Finally, the theory will incorporate inequality in wealth, income, and firm ownership by introducing heterogeneous social classes.&amp;nbsp; Using the theory, the project will derive a set of recommendations for conducting fiscal, monetary, and social insurance policy in the face of business cycle fluctuations and social inequalities.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We expect the proposed research to have a broad impact, both in academia and among policymakers. The Academic Beneficiaries section of the grant proposal focuses on the impact of the proposed research in academia. It explains that by developing a simple and realistic model of macroeconomic fluctuations that accounts for unemployment and other sources of inequality, the research will benefit economists in various fields. 

This document focuses on the impact of the proposed research outside academia. Outside academia, three types of policymakers will directly benefit from the research: policymakers in international institutions such as the International Monetary Fund, who implement broad sets of policies to tackle recessions; policymakers in governments, who implement fiscal policy and social insurance programs; and policymakers in central banks, who conduct monetary policy. 

These policymakers will benefit from three outputs of the project: theoretical policy arguments, developed in research papers; the toolbox of computer programs usable to simulate the effects of various policies; and policy recommendations, summarized in a book.

We expect the theoretical arguments and results in the papers to influence policymakers. Indeed, policymakers use relevant academic research to substantiate arguments they have in favour and against different policy options. For instance, our paper on optimal unemployment insurance was cited to support the case for extending unemployment benefits in a hearing of the US Senate Budget Committee in 2011 (see attached congressional testimony). 

We also expect that policymakers worldwide will use and benefit from the toolbox of computer programs that we will develop and make available online. Using the toolbox, they will be able to benchmark their policy options and assess the quantitative effect of proposed policies in our calibrated macroeconomic model. They will be able to answer practical questions such as: 

- What is the effect on unemployment of an increase in the replacement rate of unemployment insurance by 10%?

- What is the effect on hiring and profits of a cut in the employer payroll tax rate by 3%?

As explained in Pathways to Impact, I will solicit the views of policymakers to ensure that the toolbox is useful to them.

We expect policymakers to benefit from our book. The book will summarize the findings from the research and benchmark policy options with case studies. It will also offer a set of actionable policy prescriptions to fight unemployment and recessions in presence of inequality. With the book, these audiences will learn about new policy options to fight recessions. In practice, the book will address a broad range of policy questions. By answering these questions, the research will provide direct guidance for many practical policy decisions faced by policymakers in times of recessions. Such questions include:

- Should unemployment insurance be more generous in recessions to stimulate aggregate demand? Or should it be less generous to incentivise unemployed workers to search harder for jobs?

- Should payroll tax shift from employees to employers in recessions to stimulate aggregate demand by transferring income from firm owners to workers? Or should it shift from employers to employees to reduce labour costs and stimulate hiring?

- Should income tax be more progressive in recessions to stimulate aggregate demand by transferring income from the rich to the poor? Or should it be more regressive to encourage work and entrepreneurship?

- Should the government hire workers in the public sector in recessions to reduce unemployment? Or should it fire public workers to reduce public debt and stimulate private enterprise? 

Finally, if the project were successful and improved the practice of macroeconomic policy, society at large would benefit. By reducing unemployment and inequality, the policies would promote a fair society with many opportunities</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>237136</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of California, Berkeley</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with Emmanuel Saez - UC Berkeley</gtr:description><gtr:id>D6485F5A-CA2D-4BE9-8EE0-85BD7C292C82</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Collaboration led to publishing of research papers, discussion papers, development of model</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>544a2cebb0e237.44078498-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Collaboration led to publishing of research papers, discussion papers, development of model</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Collaboration led to publishing of research papers, discussion papers, development of model</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of California, Berkeley</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:department>Centre For Equitable Growth</gtr:department><gtr:description>Collaboration with Emmanuel Saez</gtr:description><gtr:id>E00495B7-D10F-40AE-A5D1-0EA438880C47</gtr:id><gtr:impact>CFM Discussion paper; publication in The Quarterly Journal of Economics</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cf0d4398cdb0.52862723-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Same as above</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>This collaboration resulted in a research project which provides guidance to policymakers for designing policies that are able to bring economies out of recessions by identifying the best policies to fight unemployment and stabilize the business cycle while alleviating inequality.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The Optimal Use of Government Purchases for Stabilization</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FA38DD28-93F6-4913-81A3-39EE00065AA5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Academic seminar at the University of California--Davis, CA, USA.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cf9f82df79b5.12621666</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The curse of inflation</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C7ADF7C7-6CBA-4A94-84CA-FCB730754288</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentations given at University of Rochester, New York University, Johns Hopkins University, Toulouse School of Economics, Zurich University, Goethe University in Frankfurt am Main and University of Texas, Austin to a collective audience of over 500 people, this sparked questions and discussion afterwards, there is also the possibility of future collaborations</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cf0ec509a1c1.14657764</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The Optimal Use of Government Purchases for Stabilization</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5AA0333F-8803-4A31-8393-DB2CBF1F2A1A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Academic seminar at Harvard University, MA, USA.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cf9c12370ba6.81175138</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Aggregate demand, idle time, and unemployment - UCLA</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>882EBC4D-1763-48D1-B624-1DF0222250CA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation sparked questions and discussion

The first and second projects were revisions of work I had produced before the grant started. The third and fourth projects are new workings paper produced after the grant started.

The first project is described in two companion papers and is entitled &amp;quot;A Macroeconomic Approach to Optimal Unemployment Insurance.&amp;quot; The first of the two papers, &amp;quot;A Macroeconomic Approach to Optimal Unemployment Insurance: Theory&amp;quot;, is forthcoming in the American Economic Journal: Economic Policy. The second of the two papers, &amp;quot;A Macroeconomic Approach to Optimal Unemployment Insurance: Applications&amp;quot;, has received a Revise and Resubmit from the American Economic Journal: Economic Policy. This project is joint work with Emmanuel Saez and Camille Landais. This project makes two contributions. First, it develops a theory that relates the generosity of the unemployment insurance (UI) system to the unemployment rate. Combined with empirical evidence, this theory suggests that the government should provide more generous UI when the unemployment rate is high in slumps and less generous UI when the unemployment rate is low in booms. Second, this project develops an empirical methodology to determine at any point in time, using available statistics, whether the current level of UI is optimal, too high, or too low.

The second project, which is described in an article published in the Quarterly Journal of Economics, is entitled &amp;quot;A Model of Aggregate Demand, Idle Time, and Unemployment.&amp;quot; It is joint work with Emmanuel Saez. This project also makes two contributions. First, it develops a new model of unemployment. The model incorporates three determinants of the unemployment rate: the frictions that make it costly for firms to find a suitable employee, the wages of workers, and the idleness of workers on the job---which is itself determined by the number of customers of the firm and the number of workers available to serve them. Second, it combines the theoretical predictions of the model with empirical evidence for the US to identify the sources of labor-market fluctuations. Through the lens of our simple model, the empirical evidence suggests that unemployment fluctuations are mainly driven by aggregate demand shocks that affect the idleness of workers on the job and thus the number of workers that firms desire to hire.

The third project, which is described in a working paper, is entitled &amp;quot;An Economical Business-Cycle Model.&amp;quot; It is joint work with Emmanuel Saez. This project also makes two contributions. First, it constructs an alternative model of business cycles capturing two features of advanced economies in recent decades (Japan, US, and European Union): low and stable inflation and long periods of liquidity trap. Second, this project uses the model to study the effects of a broad range of conventional and unconventional monetary and debt policies. The policies analyzed include issuance of money through open-market operations, helicopter drop of money, tax on wealth, and deficit spending.

The fourth project, which is described in a working paper, is entitled &amp;quot;The Optimal Use of Government Purchases for Stabilization&amp;quot;. It is joint work with Emmanuel Saez. This project makes two main contributions. First, it develops a formula that determines the optimal level of government purchases over the business cycle, taking into account how people value the public services provided by the government and how government purchases contribute to stabilizing the unemployment rate. In particular, the formula implies that the optimal government purchases depends on the government-purchases multiplier and the deviation of the unemployment rate from its efficient level. With a positive multiplier, optimal government purchases are higher when unemployment is inefficiently high and lower when unemployment is inefficiently low. Second, the project calibrates the formula to US data. A first implication is that US government purchases are optimal with a small multiplier of 0.04; if the multiplier is larger, US government purchases are not countercyclical enough. Another implication is that optimal government purchases should increase during recessions. With a multiplier of 0.5 the government purchases should increases from 16.6% of GDP to 20.0% of GDP when the unemployment rate rises from the US average of 5.9% to 9%. With multipliers higher than 0.5 the optimal ratio increases less because fewer government purchases are required to fill the unemployment gap: with a multiplier of 2 government purchases should only increase from 16.6% of GDP to 17.6% of GDP; this is the same increase as with a tiny multiplier of 0.07.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings of the project on unemployment insurance can be taken forward by economists working in the fields of labor economics. Labor economists can use our theory to guide their empirical measurement of the effect of unemployment insurance on the labor market. Indeed, our theory clearly defines the statistics that must be measured in the data to design the optimal unemployment insurance system. A number of research teams have been working on these questions using our model in the past few years (see for instance http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjt001 and http://dx.doi.org/10.1257/aer.20131273 and http://dx.doi.org/10.3386/w22447). The empirical methodology developed in the project could also be used by policy makers to monitor in real time whether the unemployment rate is efficient, inefficiently high, or inefficiently low. When the unemployment rate is inefficient, policy makers should adjust their monetary and fiscal policies to bring the unemployment rate closer to its efficient level.

The model developed in the project on unemployment fluctuations can be used by macroeconomists to determine the origins of business-cycle fluctuations. In the project we use our model to separate between four types of macroeconomic shocks in US data: (1) high mismatch caused by major shocks to the financial and housing sectors, (2) low search effort from unemployed workers triggered by extensions of unemployment insurance benefits, (3) low productivity, and (4) low aggregate demand caused by a sudden need to repay debts or pessimism. This analysis could be replicated in many other countries, and it could be extended to many other shocks. 

The findings of project on monetary policy can be taken forward by macroeconomists working in monetary economics. First, there are a number of macroeconomic policies that can be examined using the model that we developed. Second, the model could be simulated and compared to the data in order to validate the theory and study quantitative questions. Third, the formulas for optimal monetary policy developed in the project could be used by central bankers to adjust the nominal interest rate as macroeconomic shocks occur and the unemployment rate fluctuates. These formulas are particularly user-friendly because they are expressed with statistics that can be measured in the data in real time.

The findings of the project on government purchases can be taken forward by macroeconomists working in fiscal policy. Indeed, our formula defines the statistics that must be measured in the data to determine the optimal amount of government purchases over the business cycle. Empirical macroeconomists could work to provide better measures of these statistics using new methods and new data. The statistics that should be estimated are the government-purchases multiplier, the elasticity of substitution between private and public goods, and the unemployment gap. The formula developed in the project could be used by policy makers around the world to adjust the amount of goods and services that the government purchases over the business cycle as the unemployment rate fluctuates.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>ADA657C8-496D-494D-B07C-832D33D556D2</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545b03c920b0a5.84299348</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.voxeu.org/article/unemployment-and-product-and-labour-market-tightness</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>09F6E033-C912-44A4-836B-B9FEAAC05416</gtr:id><gtr:title>Aggregate Demand, Idle Time, and Unemployment *</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Quarterly Journal of Economics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ca606d039a79f8257cd8b95e326220e7"><gtr:id>ca606d039a79f8257cd8b95e326220e7</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Michaillat P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56ceda87dd1a40.77293547</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>88582CB3-9635-42F4-93DF-F14BE07852C1</gtr:id><gtr:title>An Economical Business-Cycle Model</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ca606d039a79f8257cd8b95e326220e7"><gtr:id>ca606d039a79f8257cd8b95e326220e7</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Michaillat P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>543bd7ad087547.79734504</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>77C99011-FA88-4146-B0C7-44570C32338F</gtr:id><gtr:title>A Theory of Countercyclical Government Multiplier</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ca606d039a79f8257cd8b95e326220e7"><gtr:id>ca606d039a79f8257cd8b95e326220e7</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Michaillat P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>543bd7678a8f70.35668921</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1B27CF97-059F-4BCA-9914-61877918C78B</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Optimal Use of Government Purchases for Macroeconomic Stabilization</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ca606d039a79f8257cd8b95e326220e7"><gtr:id>ca606d039a79f8257cd8b95e326220e7</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Michaillat P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56cf08e60aa484.70792821</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0E0D5F99-90F3-4256-83F8-6EE2DE98866F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Aggregate Demand, Idle Time, and Unemployment</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>CFM Discussion Paper Series</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5191216b72bc681799fe3a168ce3b04e"><gtr:id>5191216b72bc681799fe3a168ce3b04e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pascal Michaillat and Emmanuel Saez</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>5444ff43330cf0.16319631</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1C9656FD-9310-4E8E-B2E2-B9F856BE6160</gtr:id><gtr:title>An Economical Business-Cycle Model</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>CFM Discussion Paper Series</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5191216b72bc681799fe3a168ce3b04e"><gtr:id>5191216b72bc681799fe3a168ce3b04e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pascal Michaillat and Emmanuel Saez</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>5445041c6cfed5.62108692</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>39916AE6-E6E9-406C-A958-A99D0F2F9938</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Curse of Inflation</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ca606d039a79f8257cd8b95e326220e7"><gtr:id>ca606d039a79f8257cd8b95e326220e7</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Michaillat P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56cf0ac4116e25.87107584</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/K008641/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>249FA81B-498A-424B-9C57-C9BC20E4F688</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Macroeconomics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
