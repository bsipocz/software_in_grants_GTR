In the post 9/11 context the use of extradition, citizenship deprivation and charter flight deportations have been promoted, assisted in part by changes to the law, yet little is known about the extent of these forms of removal; who it is that is being extradited, having their citizenship deprived and being deported en masse; what the conditions are in which these removals occur; and what the justifications are for their use. This research will attempt to address these issues.

Race, immigration and citizenship have always been deeply connected to each other but there have been stark changes in the context of the War on Terror which have intensified processes of removal in different ways. They have impacted disproportionately on Muslim and black and minority ethnic communities and have made it more difficult to access and make claims to rights of citizenship. Under the counter-terrorism agenda, revisions to law in 2003 have meant it has become easier to extradite individuals and initial analysis suggests the number of requests for extradition to the US have increased significantly since 2003. In this context, there have been a number of high profile cases whereby the protections of British citizenship, such as the possibility to respond to accusations in a UK court of law prior to removal, have been suspended. Political debates have ensued concerning who should have protections of British citizenship and who should not. Further amendments to nationality law mean it is also possible to deprive dual-nationals of their British citizenship if the Home Secretary makes a decision that their presence is 'not conducive to the public good'. More than 23 individuals have been stripped of their citizenship since 2003 and over 18 of these have been since 2010. These more severe measures of removal have also impacted on longstanding processes of deportation. In 2001 the Government began to use charter flights in order to ease and speed up the process of enforced removals. There have been charter flights to Afghanistan, Nigeria, Sri Lanka, Ghana, Pakistan and Iraq, and between December 2012 and April 2013 972 individuals were removed in this way. 

Against this background, the proposed research will conduct an investigation into the policies and processes of extradition, citizenship deprivation and mass deportation since 2001 examining the extent to which these processes are occurring, who they are happening to, what the racial dimensions of these processes are and what the narratives are which justify or contest these processes of removal. The findings will be brought together to assess what the implications are for the relationship between race and citizenship.

The research will include documentary analysis of policy literature and legal decisions; interviews with lawyers; analysis of statistical data obtained through freedom of information requests; case studies of individuals subject to extradition and citizenship deprivation which will include interviews with family members, and third sector organisations; and discourse analysis of parliamentary debates and media representations.

An advisory group made up of users will be consulted throughout the research project and subsequent dissemination activities. This is to ensure that the data collected is of use beyond the academy, and to ensure that the research has impact. Research outputs will include dissemination to practitioners (through a one-day workshop, and a 15-page research report), dissemination to the general public (through newspaper coverage, commentary pieces in popular press, a report, a project website and blog), and academic dissemination (through conference presentations, journal articles, and a research monograph in hard copy and digital format).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research project will draw on the expertise of an advisory group throughout the process from research design to dissemination. Representatives will include Paul Wiles (visiting Professor of Criminology at the University of Oxford and former scientific advisor to the Home Office), Ian Macdonald QC (leading barrister in immigration, race relations law), a senior representative from Leigh Day law firm, Asim Qureshi (Research Director at Cage Prisoners), a representative from the Home Office, and a representative from Liberty, who will assist with access to key interviewees and help promote the dissemination and impact. This will ensure a commitment to research that is of interest and use to non-academics. Overall the findings of this research will be of significant interest to all interested in equality, human rights and the state of citizenship in Britain. Interested parties will include, but will not be limited to: 

(1) Human Rights and Immigration Lawyers 
(2) Third Sector organisations such as Liberty, Cage Prisoners, Migrant Rights Network, Runnymede Trust, Institute for Race Relations
(3) The Home Office
(4) The Equality and Human Rights Commission and the Government Equalities Office
(5) Thinktanks working on immigration and citizenship 
(6) Families and communities who have had direct involvement with citizenship deprivation, extradition and mass deportation
(7) The national media including the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, The Guardian, The Independent
(8) General Public

The research has clear relevance for these parties because of their investments in issues concerning citizenship, equality and human rights. In the case of lawyers and third-sector organisations, their interest is in ascertaining the extent to which these processes of removal are occurring in order to gain an overview of the situation beyond the cases in which they are directly involved. In respect to the Home Office and the equality bodies, the research will be of direct interest to their respective policy agendas concerning citizenship, equality and human rights. Thinktanks working on immigration and citizenship will be interested in learning more about the details of particular forms of removal and how they inform and impact upon processes of immigration as a whole; families and individuals affected will have an interest in raising awareness of these issues; and the national media and general public will respond to the high public interest in the research.

As detailed in the Pathway to Impact attachment, findings will be disseminated to these non-academic respondents through various channels including a one-day workshop, and 15-page research report. It is anticipated that the workshop will promote important discussion between lawyers, third sector organisations, Home Office and government officials and representatives from equality bodies, and will lead to a series of agreed 'next steps' which all participants will commit to act upon. The findings report will also inform future campaigns by organisations such as Liberty, Cage Prisoners and Migrants' Rights Network. In this respect, it is anticipated that the results of this research will have an impact beyond the academy. 

The research findings will be further disseminated to the general public and participants through a project website and blog, press releases to the national media, commentary articles on the issues of citizenship and removal published in a range of outlets, and an overview report accessible for non-specialists. In this manner, the research findings will be used to promote awareness concerning the extent of citizenship removal and exclusion and prompt debate with regards to the implications of these changes to policy for citizenship as a whole. Academic dissemination will also be communicated to the general public through a separate portal on the project website which will link to publications associated with the project.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-01-18</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-19</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>245043</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>White Rose University Consortium</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Europe, Migration and the Politics of (In)security</gtr:description><gtr:id>4287E651-1B1A-4CCF-B37D-FADE10CEA28E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>First Workshop: 'Experiencing Insecurities', University of Leeds, 3rd March 2017.

The event allowed for some of the key research themes to be expressed in an accessible format reaching a wider non-academic audience (approximately 30 people attended in person). The event also included a live Twitter stream and was videoed and subsequently uploaded onto Youtube (the video has had 158 views thus far).
