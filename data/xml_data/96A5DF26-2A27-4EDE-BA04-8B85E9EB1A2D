Why would a community adopt Jewish identity as a social liberation strategy? The proposed project will address these questions by focusing on the Bene-Ephraim of Andhra Pradesh (India), whose unique circumstances provide an interesting new perspective on theoretical discussion about legitimization of identities. \n\nThe community of Bene-Ephraim (or 'Telugu Jews') was established in the late 1980s in the Guntur District of Andhra Pradesh by a group of Christianised Madiga untouchables who declared that they belonged to one of the Lost Tribes of Israel. In 1992 the community established a synagogue and introduced a number of Jewish rites into their practice. Shortly afterwards they started seeking recognition by the State of Israel and among the Jewish communities in the West. Though they have not been 'recognised' by any of Israeli officials the community have established contacts with Amishav and Kulanu organizations in Israel and the USA respectively, which unite those interested in finding and assisting communities that are 'rediscovering' their Jewish origin. Through this connection Bene-Ephraim have had several visits from rabbis and other interested individuals who have been helping them to establish practices of more mainstream Judaism. \n\nThe objectives of the project are to explore the emergence and development of the Bene-Ephraim movement in the local context, to contribute to an improved understanding of the implications of Judaising movements for discussions of Jewish identity in the wider Jewish community and the State of Israel, and to examine to what extent the movement of Bene Ephraim reflects processes of group identification and social categorization and also of the production of individually unique and/or collective social identities. More specifically, the project will explore the question of community membership, their relationship with and historical connection to other Madiga, their understandings of Judaism and Jewish culture, practices and narratives of origin, and the way Bene-Ephraim are viewed by their neighbours, Indian and Israeli authorities and different diaspora Jewish communities. \n\nThe Bene-Ephraim movement appears to be an excellent site for the development of new understandings of the critical identity theory. The project will explore what identity markers the community considered to be useful to employ in their attempt to escape discrimination and why they considered these markers available for them to choose. Our analysis will also contribute to theoretical discussions about the interface between external social categorization and internal group identification. The proposed study will explore the extent to which Bene-Ephraim identities have been and are being shaped by the responses of others, both on the macro level of national and international politics and on the micro level of everyday interactions between individual Bene-Ephraim and their neighbours and local authorities. The study will also be examining the interface between individual and group identities. How did individual members of the community decide to join it? Were they free to choose Bene-Ephraim identity or was it a necessity determined by structural factors? \n\nThe study will involve extensive fieldwork among the Bene- Ephraim in Andhra Pradesh, in-depth interviews with members of organisations that have noticed and responded to the community, and will involve an analysis of the literature produced by the leaders of the community and of mass media representations of the Bene Ephraim. \n\nThe project will be based in Anthropology Department of Durham University which has a strong tradition of studying issues of identity in South Asia and beyond. \n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-06-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>127481</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation at the Limmud Jewish education conference</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>ECFC0CFD-C865-4F6D-A872-0E6DAD39B603</gtr:id><gtr:impact>About 50 people attended my talk, which stimulated a discussion about meanings of Jewishness.

Our project has cast a new theoretical light on this question by exploring the Bene Ephraim community of Madiga Dalits from rural Andhra Pradesh, India, who at the end of the twentieth century declared their affiliation to the Lost Tribes of Israel. Our main argument is that by embracing the Jewish tradition the Bene Ephraim have both expanded conventional definitions of ?Who is a Jew? and found a new way to celebrate their Dalit heritage and to fight caste inequality. Publications stemming from the project (7 peer-reviewed paper and a monograph, published with OUP, New York) )have focused on the life of the community in the village, but also explored a wider range of ethnographic sites, including Israel and the USA, where we discussed how the time old Lost Tribes tradition is embraced today by groups and organizations which support the Bene Ephraim and similar communities that declared Jewish descent in the twentieth century. We have demonstrated how the example of the Bene Ephraim can throw light on a wide range of issues in national and international politics, such as the caste system and social mobility in India, the conflict in the Middle East, the rhetoric of the ?war on terror?, and debates surrounding the Law of Return in Israel.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings will be of interest to scholars of Jewish and South Asian Studies, anthropologists of religion, identity theorists, as well as to general readers. 

In Jewish Studies, our conclusion about the way Jewishness can be seen as a form of social protest, may be used to scholars working int he field of critical identity theory. 

Outside of academia, I findings will be of use to NGOs working with isolated Jewish communities. They will also be of use to university-level, school-level and community educators who teach about Jewish communities and Judaism.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>7083F518-9C5A-44B4-A76C-56E1C70350A0</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54412d87401056.98179057</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5CDC0292-1B26-40B9-9622-E575F2A83B2F</gtr:id><gtr:title>The substance that empowers?
