The principal investigators are Stan Siebert and Xiangdong Wei (Lingnan University, Hong Kong), with John Heywood of Wisconsin-Milwaukee as co-investigator. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>The aim is to find the root of China's world-beating productivity, and in particular to assess how the company has adapted to China's relatively high levels of labour regulation. (as measured, for example, by the World Bank's current Ease of Doing Business Report). The company is experimenting with various innovative labour practices such as team-working and incentive pay schemes, and the results will be tracked. A further aspect of the research is assessing the consequences of these practices for workers, by conducting periodic job satisfaction surveys.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project addresses central concerns of personnel economics and strategic human resource researchers. The evidence on the high performance paradigm tends to be distorted by omission of the management ability factor which our quasi-experimental approach avoids. In fact, our results may well not support the paradigm, or support a &amp;quot;contingency&amp;quot; view whereby high performance practices improve outcomes when applied to some worker groups (eg full-timers), but not when applied to others.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>80026</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The Consequences of a Piece Rate on Quantity and Quality: Explorations from Two Field Experiments</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6E63DEDB-DFE4-4BCF-AB62-3ECD5827287E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The talk resulted in good questions and discussion

The first was in August 2012, and then we staged an improvement in June 2014. We have thus achieved our main research objective of using the field experimental methodology to overcome the &amp;quot;selection&amp;quot; problem that particular worker types with unobservable ability may select pay schemes where ability has an extra pay-off, leading to misleading conclusions. Our project is one of the few to use this robust methodology to study incentive pay. 
 A fundamental finding is that piece rates do not simply raise quantity at the expense of quality, which is a common criticism of piece rates. Instead, our results imply that the careful selection of (&amp;quot;committed&amp;quot;) workers interacts with monitoring practices and the piece rate's high-powered incentives to influence the workforce's quality-quantity performance. Different combinations of these three practices have different costs, and the firm selects among practices to deliver a chosen workforce quality-quantity outcome. In other words, the firm can refine its worker selection and monitoring options together with the payment system to deliver a chosen (optimum) quality-quantity.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our two experiments have implications for the design of incentive pay systems which are central to worker motivation. The findings will contribute to the literature on what really happens, using robust experimental methodology, when piece rates are instituted under various monitoring and worker selection conditions. These results will also indluence practical management. 
An important next step is to show how the three payment system variables that we identify are used in practice. We are therefore aim to analyse how payment systems and worker selection are used by the firms in practice, and the Workplace Employment Relations Survey (WERS) offers questions on all three of our variables which could make it a suitable database. We are taking this approach forward.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C7446059-A84D-41A9-9FD8-21262321310E</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545dd04e65aef6.77199211</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Retail</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.iza.org/en/webcontent/publications/papers/viewAbstract?dp_id=7660</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Three datasets have been collected. The first, based on worker personnel records at the Dacheng noodle group (our first study company) was deposited with the UK data service in 2012.
 Two further datasets on the randomised control experiment at the Halai Kunde Technology company (Shenzhen, China) have also been collected. Both give worker output quantity (words typed) and quality (error rates) under time and piece rates, with two levels of monitoring (10% vs 50% of outputs checked for errors). The first of these datasets is described in our IZA Working Paper 7660 (Sept 2013) (see publications). The description of the second database is currently being finalised for publication later this year in a further IZA Working Paper.
The technical documentation of these datasets is still under development.</gtr:description><gtr:id>F6A3641B-F7F4-4359-9527-3F8B7C715830</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The development of this research database has enabled us to develop two papers on &amp;quot;The consequences of a piece rate on quantity and quality&amp;quot;, using randomised control trial methodology.

The company implemented a performance-and-fine pay scheme in January 2011, so our data cover over one year before and after. The novel aspect of the scheme is fines levied on employees proportional to their responsibility for costs of product recall. In addition, we conducted before and after surveys of worker background and opinions. It was deposited with the UK data service in 2012.
 This intitial research underlay our later 2 experiments with the Halai Kunde Technology company where we were able to institute the Dacheng company's fine system in a proper randomized control way. We also adopted the Dacheng technique of worker surveys, and were thereby able to measure worker &amp;quot;commitment&amp;quot; which has proved to be a powerful variable.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-1031365730.82894612b203d32</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Hong Kong-bilateral-Labour Management</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://discover.ukdataservice.ac.uk/catalogue/?sn=850809&amp;type=Data%20catalogue</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4C3CF317-DFDF-4896-98CC-16956090637C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Consequences of a Piece Rate on Quantity and Quality?
