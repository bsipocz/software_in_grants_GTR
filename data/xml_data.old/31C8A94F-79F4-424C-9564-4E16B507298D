However, so far, this literature has failed to give satisfactory answers to two fundamental questions:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>Do repeated elections under authoritarian rule facilitate democratisation or do elections help dictators cling to power?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Under what circumstances do mechanisms of democracy promotion affect the consequences of authoritarian elections?&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This Research Seminar series aims to contribute to the answering of these questions by providing, for the first time, a platform to discuss the role and impact of elections under authoritarianism from four different perspectives: regional studies, democratisation studies, authoritarianism studies, and the point of view of organisations working in the area of democracy promotion.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The potential impact of the proposed seminar series is not restricted to academic research, but the workshops will also generate policy-relevant conclusions concerning the effects of elections on the persistence of authoritarian rule. Hence the likely beneficiaries of the proposed seminar series not only include the scholarly community but also governments and NGOs, both nationally and internationally, working in the field of democracy promotion. 

Democracy assistance is a growth industry. According to World Bank data the total amount spent on democracy promotion increased tenfold between 1991 and 2000 - from 0.5 to 5.0% of developmental aid - and the number of institutions involved in such aid has multiplied as well. Several bilateral and multilateral donors, NGOs, foundations and institutions have developed a strong interest in the promotion of democracy and good governance. The US government, in 2011, increased the annual 'governance and democracy' funding by 10%, from US$ 204.3 million to 225.7 million (Patterson 2012). In many EU countries, spending on democracy promotion has also increased in recent years (Youngs 2008).

While the menu of strategies, instruments and measures to promote democracy has considerably diversified in the past two decades, promoting elections remains the central cornerstone of democracy promotion for most agencies. For example, the UK government - through the Department for International Development (DFID) - has committed itself to supporting 13 countries to hold freer and fairer elections by 2015. 

Academic members of the core seminar team have - through previous projects - established close links with many of relevant organisations, including International IDEA, the International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES), the National Democratic Institute (NDI), and the German political foundations (such as the Friedrich Ebert Stiftung, FES). What is more, the Durham Global Security Institute maintains close links with relevant UK government departments and NGOs.

In addition, the core group also includes Mette Bakken - an Electoral Assistance Specialist at the European Centre for Electoral Support (ECES) - who, through her job, maintains excellent relationships with the industry.

In the early design stage of the proposed seminar series, a number of relevant organisations were consulted on a regular basis (including, for example, FES and ECES). These consultations revealed that the main issue in the field of democracy promotion is the persistent uncertainty over whether implemented strategies are working or not. Organisations lack both a systematic framework to evaluate the effectiveness of programmes and, because programmes are usually developed and managed locally, cross-nationally comparable data to guide strategy adjustments. 

Over the medium-long term, it is thus expected that the proposed seminar series will be able to deliver the following benefits to the different parties identified:

- Enhanced capacity to develop evaluation frameworks for current and projected programmes by: (a) increasing knowledge about the methodological challenges in assessing the effectiveness of democracy promotion efforts; (b) providing new understanding of theoretical work on electoral authoritarianism; and (c) providing assistance in translating methodological and theoretical scholarship into practical diagnostic tools and applications.
- Contributing to effective policy and investment decisions on democracy promotion: The seminars encourage co-produced research that furthers our understanding as of when democracy promotion under electoral authoritarianism has a democratising effect and when it will have the unintended effect of stabilising autocratic rule. 
- Establishing a sustainable network for knowledge exchange between researchers and non-academic stakeholders that can be used to assess the effect of future policy interventions and assist in adjusting strategic frameworks.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>30340</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop on democracy assistance</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A17314BC-650C-499E-B7EE-64DDCF09358A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Organised one-day workshop that was attended by representatives from various democracy assistance organisations.

To jointly work towards a better understanding of the contextual factors that affect the effectiveness of democracy promotion programmes, we engaged with relevant stakeholders from the very early stages of the Research Seminar series, giving them an opportunity to shape the content and direction of the series. Workshops were attended by a broad range of organisations, such as the Department for International Development, the OSCE, the Westminster Foundation for Democracy, International IDEA, and the Friedrich Ebert Foundation.

The most obvious impact of the Research Seminar series is thus the establishment of collaborative network that links scholars working on questions of democratisation to organisations working in the field of democracy promotion. We continue to use these network links to explore opportunities for joint research projects.

Second, through informal feedback we know that non-academic stakeholders found the workshops very useful in terms of informing their own internal discussions about strategy and policy. We maintain contact to organisations that participated in the Research Seminar series to monitor whether strategic changes can be linked back to workshop debates.

Third, we will publish our key findings as a special issue with the International Political Science Review (accepted and likely to be published in the second half of 2017). We aim to circulate this special issue - accompanied by an executive summary that avoids overly technical language - to a wider audience of relevant non-academic stakeholders. A follow-up request for feedback will help us establish whether our findings led to policy changes within the respective organisations.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2017</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>DEB28D6E-5201-4E5C-8CE6-1B4CA0FF17C3</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56e008f04f24a9.13135671</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The main objective of this ESRC Research Seminar series was to further our understanding of &amp;quot;electoral authoritarian&amp;quot; regimes - that is, authoritarian regimes holding regular elections. Specifically, the Seminar series aimed to address the following question: Do repeated elections under authoritarian rule facilitate democratisation or do elections help dictators cling to power?

The existing academic literature on electoral authoritarianism had largely failed to give satisfactory answers to these questions - for mainly two reasons. First, existing work has been dominated by statistical analyses and thus suffers from a number of methodological weaknesses, such as problems of endogeneity or the difficulty to establish causal mechanisms. Second, the literature can be criticised for case selection bias, as it mainly focuses on cases of electoral authoritarianism in Sub-Sahara Africa and post-Communist Europe, while neglecting cases - both contemporary and historical - in other parts of the world, such as the Middle East or, in particular, East Asia.

The Seminar series addressed these weaknesses in the existing literature through a number of workshops that brought together quantitative and qualitative perspectives on electoral authoritarianism, and by bringing regional studies experts into the general debate on electoral authoritarianism.

Specifically, workshops came to focus on the role of the state as an intervening factor that may influence the effect of elections on authoritarian regime stability. The Seminar series generated significant new knowledge in this direction, highlighting how the stabilising (or destabilising) effect of elections hinges on properties of the state. Findings will be published in a special issue of the International Political Science Review in 2017 (depending on the outcome of the blind peer-review process). We are also currently putting together a proposal for an edited volume, to be submitted to Cambridge University Press in mid-to-late 2016.

Moreover, based on these findings, the Seminar series also opened up important new research questions. Most significantly, breaking with the long tradition in political science to generate new knowledge through cross-country comparison at the national level, the final workshop in January 2016 focused on the sub-national level (i.e. within-country comparison), exploring how processes of democratisation and state building may unfold unevenly across a given territory. Specifically, the workshop stressed the importance of interdisciplinary research to develop methodological tools and analytical frameworks to study these uneven processes. 

Finally, the Seminar series laid the foundation for new international research networks by facilitating knowledge exchange across different disciplines. Participants were drawn from different career stages, with a particular focus on giving early-career researchers and postgraduate research students the opportunity to join the academic debate on electoral authoritarianism.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Given the uncertain effect of elections on the stability of authoritarian rule, organisations working on democracy promotion are faced with complex strategic challenges. In particular, when will investments in supporting electoral processes yield positive results and under what circumstances are they likely to achieve the opposite effect - that is, help consolidate autocratic rule?

Over the medium-long term, we expect that the findings generated through the Seminar series will contribute to effective policy and investment decisions on democracy promotion. Specifically, the findings have the potential to help organisations working in the field of democracy promotion to develop strategic frameworks that provide clearer guidance on the likely effect of democracy promotion programmes. Most importantly, the Seminar series has stressed the institutional properties of the state as a factor that needs to be taken into consideration when designing democracy promotion programmes.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>9F54C880-6C56-479A-B44F-4B78E51EAED3</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e0097f2aad37.30052013</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1835F6BB-EAA7-4D33-A15D-698CAC92866D</gtr:id><gtr:title>State Capacity, Elections and the Resilience of Authoritarian Rule</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/dd6e279f90f786b48b1823ef02c49915"><gtr:id>dd6e279f90f786b48b1823ef02c49915</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Croissant, A.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56e002e5280a28.49754052</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/L00061X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F7EEE6CD-E283-4BAB-BA5E-70B4B0F1F1A6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
