It is widely accepted that much of this spelling diversity is systematic, yet no history of English so far attempted has offered a set of etymologies to account for the diachronic and regional diversity. Traditional etymologies, as exemplified in the Oxford English Dictionary, are designed primarily to elucidate the semantic history of a word, and so tend to explain form changes only in very broad detail. Although the handbooks and grammars of early English contain descriptions of the major sound changes that account for some of the spelling diversity, such descriptions tend to focus on developments towards Standard English and so fail to chronicle the particular processes which account for individual word-forms. \n Our goal is to create a radical re-shaping of the early narrative history of English. We aim to make and publish a 'Corpus of Narrative Etymologies' (CoNE). This will explicate in unprecedented detail the evolution of individual words and affixes in the input language to the Anglo-Saxon settlement into the variant forms attested in Early Middle English (1150-1325). Underpinning CoNE will be our 'Corpus of Changes' (CC), which will document and explain the linguistic changes referred to in our individual word-histories. CoNE will complement the content of existing historical English dictionaries, both in the systematic presentation of all changes and in explaining all attested form types as a set of branching narratives. Indeed, CoNE will make explicit many of the assumptions about form histories in the historical dictionaries, and will test and revise those assumptions on the basis of new and detailed analysis. CC itself will be a valuable resource for updating and correcting the existing grammars and philological handbooks to reflect any newly noticed and newly interpreted linguistic changes that it documents.\n We have chosen as a set of 'targets' for our narrative etymologies all forms of Germanic lexical words and grammatical items (e.g. inflections, derivational affixes, articles and pronouns) recorded in the corpus of tagged texts compiled for A Linguistic Atlas of Early Middle English (LAEME). We will take as the input form for each narrative the phonetic shape an item may be presumed to have had in the dialect-complex that served as input to Old English (i.e. 'North-sea Germanic'). We aim to formulate its story, over a time-depth of 700-800 years, by reference to the changes documented in CC, as far as the collection of shapes the item evidences in the LAEME corpus. This Germanic section of CoNE will account for the variant spellings of some 5,200 items.\n The outcomes of our research will be of interest to students and researchers of the history of English in general, and Old and Middle English in particular. Within the broad subject of the history of the language, CoNE and CC will inform those who study: etymologies and the lexicon; the interface between orthography and phonology; historical dialectology. Students working with Old and Middle English texts will gain an important new resource, besides glossaries and dictionaries, to aid their understanding and interpretation. As CoNE and CC will be published through a free-access searchable on-line database, our material will also be accessible to those more generally interested in words and their origins, and in dialectal variation and how it is observable for past stages of the language. \n\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The principal impact of CoNE/CC will be on the academic community: researchers, students, teachers and editors in the field of English historical language and linguistics. In all the ways set out under Academic Beneficiaries, the CoNE/CC website will become part of the rich research hinterland of specialist information supplying meaningful knowledge transfer to the wider community.\n CoNE/CC will have considerable direct impact on historical dictionaries of English and related languages. While CoNE/CC itself will be beyond the use of those without at least some training in the field, it will, nevertheless, be a resource of enormous significance for lexicographers, and especially etymologists, of dictionaries such as OED. The OED team, and interested members of MED and DOE, will have access to the database during the course of the project. We will build into the database a feedback mechanism to allow the selected users to comment on its content and usability. OED has a status intermediate between public and private sector. It is entirely funded by Oxford University Press which, though a large academic publisher, is also a department of Oxford University and is non-profit-making.\n Via the OED, CoNE/CC has potential for extensive indirect impact to enhance quality of life and creative output and bring its research findings to a much wider audience, non-specialist as well as specialist. Many people are fascinated by the words they use, and their etymologies. The extent of public interest in language history and variation is indicated by the popularity of word programmes on BBC radio and television and by the dialect and historical language material on open-access, public service websites. OED will be a key conduit for further potential impact of CoNE/CC outside academia; it is used by many people with no training in English language or linguistics. Although OED is accessible by subscription only, there is widespread free access for non-academics via the public libraries scheme, with many libraries also providing for their readers remote access from home. OED will provide the principal channels for ensuring that the public benefit from our research. Philip Durkin, Principal Etymologist and John Simpson, Chief Editor are committed to such collaboration.\n People use dictionaries to find out the meanings of words and how they have changed over time. Through a richly detailed resource like OED they can explicate word usage in historical novels or chronicles. But there is no narrative to explain how changes in pronunciation and/or spelling have come about within English and how these can account for the linguistic variety that we find in the past and present. After completion of the CoNE project, OED staff will be able to use its contents to develop new learning resources to supply this want. These might be of the already existing 'word stories' type but with a more powerful etymological slant, enabling non-experts to trace how sound and spelling changes affected both English and related languages.\n Impact on the media will also be possible via the OED resources, which are behind programmes such as Radio 4's Word of Mouth and BBC 2's Balderdash and Piffle, both featuring etymology slots. The BBC website also has frequent discussions about word histories. CoNE's primary research will feed through into the dictionary tools more familiar to non-specialists, thus supporting public discussion.\n CoNE/CC will be freely available on open-access websites. Initially, and for the foreseeable future, the University of Edinburgh's department of Linguistics and English Language will be responsible for maintaining the site. The department is committed to making this resource available to the wider community on a long-term basis and will continue to provide the infrastructure for the site as a functioning resource.\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>683369</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>I7th International Conference on English Historical Linguistics (ICEHL 17), Zurich, Switzerland, 2012</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F99251D6-E9EB-40F4-BDB4-0241D30A8536</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Roger Lass and Margaret Laing gave a talk entitled: A Corpus of Narrative Etymologies: towards a typology of change which was immediately followed by Rhona Alcorn's talk on the project.

This tag - as the label for a set of forms - is related to a form deemed to be original for Old English (the presumed form at the time of the original settlement of speakers of a West Germanic tongue in England). Each CoNE etymology in effect tells the story of how that original form changed (often taking divers paths) to give the various forms found subsumed under the LAEME tag. The LAEME CTT provides a specificterminus ad quem for the linguistic narratives.The two fundamental parts of CoNE are the set of narrative etymologies (the Corpus of Narrative Etymologies itself) and the set of linguistic changes (the Corpus of Changes, the CC). Taking an individual tag from a menu, a user can access the etymological narrative for the forms subsumed under that tag in the LAEME CTT. An etymological narrative falls into two parts. The first is a narrative which deals with the item's evolution from its Proto-Old English origin to its attested Old English forms. These Old English forms are presumed to be input into the Middle English narrative, which accounts for the orthographic types found in LAEME. The entries in CoNE can also be searched. The Corpus of Changes can be consulted in its own right, by browsing or searching for terms.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The etymology team of the Oxford English Dictionary already use the resource in research and training.
