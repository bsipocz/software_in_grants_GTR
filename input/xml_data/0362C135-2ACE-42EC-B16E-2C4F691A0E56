Dr. Cox and the company both felt this objective was achieved, and that both parties benefitted.Dr. Cox gained an insight into the day-to-day working of an industrial laboratory, and how industrial research &amp;amp; development differs to university/clinical research &amp;amp; development (ie. time pressures, targets based on company revenue, quality assurance of incoming materials and final product, and QA documentation). She gained knowledge of the key phases of commercial assay development (feasibility, verification and validation), including assessing performance against design goals, comparison against gold standards, issues of batch to batch variation and robustness studies. She also gained specific experience working with a novel molecular assay to detect RNA targets. Seeing the different stages of product development was particularly valuable, as she will be able to apply this knowledge in the future when developing in-house assays within a university or clinical laboratory. In marketing terms, she learned about the importance of identifying areas of clinical need, market and competitor analysis, ease of use and simple interpretation of results for non-specialist users.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>This Proximity to Discovery project involved an industrial secondment to enable a postdoctoral researcher from QUB's Centre for Experimental Medicine to spend time working with a company partner (Hibergene Diagnostics Ltd.).

QUB cancer researchers have gained knowledge from the Big-data domain, and Analytics Engines have gained an insight into the vertical specialisation of bioinformatics and genomics at QUB. The team have developed an RNAseq pipeline with the potential to be used as a blueprint for DNAseq. The project has allowed the high performance computing limitation within CCRCB Bioinformatics workflows to be addressed. 
The longer-term benefit to project partners are that: 1) CCRCB can provide evidence to external funders that the appropriate capabilities to undertake supporting data analysis of molecular pathology and genomics research programs exist, and 2) for CCRCB and AE, the project will provide the essential preliminary data and evidence of success to leverage additional external funding applications to build upon this pilot data, towards a future goal of commercialization. As part of information, teaching and learning, Dr McDade and co-investigator Dr McArt have held regular knowledge-exchange sessions with AE to impart current trends in data analytics. In turn, AE will teach modern compute methods as part of the MSc in Scientific Programming and Statistical Computing.

The workshop included UK researchers in ARDS and sepsis, industry partners and experts in trials methodology. The purpose of this workshop was to discuss and define newer trial designs using enrichment strategies to deliver clinical trials in critical care. The ultimate purpose is to deliver precision medicine to critically ill patients. A direct outcome of this workshop was the submission of an outline application to the MRC Stratified Medicine Initiative call.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58adae221826a0.66036227</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seminar at Harland Medical (Minneapolis) (Dr Irwin)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AFD56C5B-2D4B-4F5F-A805-18598B2994B6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation made to Harland team and directors to inform them of on-going research projects at QUB, capabilities and expertise available at QUB, and to outline potential ways in which we could work together to address industry needs.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58ad9f7b3b0993.59440923</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Northern Ireland Clinical Innovation Conference 2015 (Belfast)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4EDAA87D-45FA-49DE-972C-103AA4AB87C2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Proximity to Discovery Fund was promoted at the 2nd annual Northern Ireland Clinical Innovation Conference, an event focused on improving collaborative efforts to accelerate adoption of innovation in the healthcare system.
