Please note that many outputs will be captured through other specific investments on grants that use HPC.
1) ARCHER is funded jointly by NERC and EPSRC and hosted by the Edinburgh Parallel and Compute Centre (EPCC). ARCHER is a capability resource allowing researchers to run, in parallel, simulations and calculations that require large numbers of processing cores. It is a Cray XC30 MPP supercomputer, with external login and post processing nodes and associated filesystems. The NERC annual allocation is 3,194 million allocation units (AU), which enables research in the atmospheric, oceanographic and mineral/geophysics remits. http://www.archer.ac.uk/about-archer/ Technical details: 4,920 compute nodes, each of two 12 core Intel Ivybridge processors, giving a total 118,080 processing cores; 64 GB of Memory/node, a subset has 128 GB. All compute nodes are provided with a high performance Lustre storage system.
2) Funded by NERC and the UK Space Agency (UKSA) JASMIN is delivered by the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC). JASMIN is a &amp;quot;&amp;quot;super-data-cluster&amp;quot;&amp;quot; which delivers infrastructure for data analysis. In technical terms it is half super-computer and half data-centre, and as such provides a globally unique computational environment. JASMIN compute and storage are linked together by a high bandwidth network, in a unique topology, and with significant compute connected with much greater bandwidth to disk than is typical of a normal data centre. (It has a supercomputer's network and storage, but without quite as much compute). JASMIN provides four basic services to the community: Storage (including disk and tape); Batch Computing; Hosted Computing, and, Cloud Computing. http://www.jasmin.ac.uk/what-is-jasmin/
3) MONSooN, hosted at the Met Office HQ in Exeter, provides a key underpinning infrastructure for the Joint Weather and Climate Research Programme (JWCRP), a strategic partnership between Met Office and the NERC. Part of the Met Office?s Cray XC40 (previously IBM Power 7) it enables research to address the JWCRP?s two key objectives: 1) Ensuring the UK has access to internationally competitive tools for forecasting climate and its impacts, and, 2) Enabling closer collaboration between Met Office and NERC scientists. From April 2017 and beyond, the service was upgraded and renamed as Monsoon2. It is now located in Exeter?s Science Park, and is in a trust zone of the Met Office?s XCS) http://collab.metoffice.gov.uk/twiki/bin/view/Support/WhatIsMONSooN. As well as a platform for joint code development, MONSooN provides access to the Met Office data storage archive and observation data; A wiki to promote collaboration and share documentation; A post-processing server to support interactive and IO-intensive data analysis. A connection to the Joint Academic Network (JANet) is also provided. Technical details: Cores/Node 32; Nodes 116; Performance 95 Tflops; CPUs/core 3,840 and 15TB memory.&amp;quot;</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2050-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>12892998</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This provided HPC facilities for a large number of UK researchers in mineral physics.
