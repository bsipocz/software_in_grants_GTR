Debates about fair access to higher education have tended to focus on the need to address the poorer attainment and aspirations of those from traditionally under-represented groups. Recently, however, policy-makers have begun recognise the need to also scrutinise the fairness of university admissions decisions. Currently there is no conclusive evidence as to whether university admissions decisions are fair in the narrow sense of simply reflecting the previous academic achievements of applicants. In this project we ask whether university applicants are equally likely to be offered university places if they are equally well-qualified, and we explore the extent to which different aspects of prior attainment explain why university applicants from lower social class backgrounds and ethnic minority groups are less likely to be offered university places than their middle class and white peers. We also ask to what extent access to higher education might be made fairer through the use of 'contextual data' to identify students from disadvantaged backgrounds with the potential to do well at university despite not having the grades usually required for admission. We answer these questions using linked data on school pupils, university applicants, and university entrants, which enables us to examine what factors influence whether or not people apply to university and whether or not they are offered a university place. Working with key organisations including the Office for Fair Access, Universities UK, and the Equality Challenge Unit, we will share our findings and recommendations with universities to help them improve the fairness of their admissions policies.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Ultimately the impact of the research is expected to benefit prospective students from non-traditional backgrounds, who will benefit from fairer admissions policies which will increase their rates of participation in higher education, including in the most selective institutions. This impact will be achieved by means of ongoing engagement with a number of key organisations, specifically public bodies charged with advising and monitoring widening participation and fair access including the Office for Fair Access and the Equality Challenge Unit; national bodies representing the university sector such as Universities UK; and individual universities seeking to improve the fairness of their undergraduate admissions decision-making practices. Whilst the project findings will be generated independently of these organisations, we will work with these bodies throughout the life of the project to ensure that our work is of maximum practical use. This will involve discussing the project objectives at the outset with senior policy makers across the sector including university Vice Chancellors (who we will access via Universities UK); seeking feedback from these constituencies on the emerging results of the project; and working intensively towards the close of the project with the Office for Fair Access, the Equality Challenge Unit, and Universities UK to develop clear evidence-based recommendations regarding the current obstacles to admission for individuals from non-traditional backgrounds and the ways in which contextual admissions policies can be used to significantly widen participation. The relevance and importance of the work to key user organisations is evidenced by their clear commitment to helping shape the work, and assisting with the development and dissemination of recommendations for good practice.
