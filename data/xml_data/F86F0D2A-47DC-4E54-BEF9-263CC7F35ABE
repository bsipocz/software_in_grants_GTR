This association is apparent whether cognition is measured in childhood, middle age or old age. However, the cause of this relationship is currently unknown.
I am in an extremely favourable position to investigate cognition and health due to my unique combination of current skills in psychometrics and epidemiology, the fantastic training environment that the University of Edinburgh can offer and the opportunity to work on two unique and rare databases. These three factors will allow me to examine cognition and health closely and determine why such a relationship exists. More specifically, data from the Health and Lifestyle Survey will allow me to examine the relationship between cognition and health across the entire adult age range while the wide range of data available in the Newcastle 1000 Families Study will be used to investigate potential mediators in this relationship.
Being able to determine explanatory factors for the relationship between cognition and health will be extremely beneficial in the establishment of preventative health measures. Reducing inequalities in health is a major government initiative and intervention should only be developed in light of understanding the underlying factors.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Aims and objectives
To use the Health and Lifestyle Survey (HALS) and the Newcastle 1000 Families Study to provide important new information about the role of cognitive function on later health outcomes. Specifically, to examine whether change in cognition and social risk factors contribute to the risk of mortality and morbidity in the HALS; to examine childhood cognitive ability in relation to adult risk factors for poor health, morbidity and mortality including the exploration of potential mediating variables in the 1000 Families Study

Design and methodology
Over the 48 months of the proposed study, data will be collated, checked and analysed and manuscripts prepared for publication. The HALS is a nationwide survey which took place on two occasions, seven years apart, to measure changes in physical and mental health, attitudes and lifestyle in a representative sample of adults (n = 9003). It will be analysed in collaboration with the MRC Social and Public Health Science Unit in Glasgow. The 1000 Families Study is a prospective cohort study in to which all babies born in the city of Newcastle Upon Tyne during May and June 1947 were recruited (n = 1142). It has information on various paediatric health outcomes together with health, occupation, and social circumstances to age 50 years. This study will be completed in collaboration with two departments of Newcastle University. In both cases the data will be analysed using both psychometric and epidemiological techniques. Multivariate analysis and structural equation modelling will be used to test models to investigate the age and sex specific relationship between cognition and health and whether social and lifestyle factors act as confounders or indirect paths in this relationship.

Scientific and medical opportunities
Having longitudinal data on cognition, lifestyle and health in a normal population sample such as in the Health and Lifestyle Survey is rare. The 1000 Families Study is unique in that it contains a prospective record of many aspects of infancy and childhood alongside substantial information on living circumstances at age 50 years. This proposal therefore has the unique opportunity to add a great deal to the literature on cognition and morbidity and mortality. With such a rapidly expanding elderly population the public-health implications of determining preventative health measures and reducing inequalities in health are enormous.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2005-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>120913</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Rotary group - Fife</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:id>BA579032-8F4F-4CF2-A61C-8BD5BC52760F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I was invited to give a talk to the Fife Rotary group as their weekly speaker on the links between cognition and later adult health.
