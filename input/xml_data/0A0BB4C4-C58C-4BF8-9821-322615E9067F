Bearing no relation to the British serial of the same name, it ran for four years and after a shaky beginning, went on to become the most popular television show in the country. \n\nAfter the collapse of the former Soviet Union, massive amounts of international development aid poured into the successor states. British aid was channelled through several departments, administrations and agencies. Crossroads, a product of a novel synthesis of the FCO with ODA (Overseas Development Administration, now known as DFID, Department for International Development), was part of this joint initiative branded 'Marshall Plan of the Mind,' (MPM), meant to win hearts and minds of the recently Soviet citizens of this enormous region undergoing massive and traumatic transitions. Of particular interest to the MPM projects was imparting ideas about democracy, privatisation and the free market.\n\nMarshall Plan of the Mind focused on media and culture. An early project, a radio soap opera in Russia, based on The Archers, involved British writers and producers spending months in Moscow training local writers in the techniques of radio drama series production. This was a social realist slice-of-life drama, similar to the remit of the Archers, transposed to Soviet-era urban housing block. The success of this production encouraged MPM to be more ambitious, and the next step was television. Kazakhstan was chosen as a hospitable site to host the several dozen British trainers, all working at the enormous and empty KazakhFilm Studios (during the USSR, this studio produced films by Eisenstein and many other luminaries). \n\nOver a several year period, several dozen British free-lance professionals, veterans of EastEnders, Brookside and other UK serials, passed through the KazakhFilm Studios in Almaty, Kazakhstan, training several hundred local Kazakhstanis in everything from script editing to costume to make-up to set-design.\n\nThe British government's brief to the media trainers was to convey a neo-liberal agenda of privatisation, market economy along with a vision of a more democratic and pluralist state. In the process, they were also meant to teach high quality television production and writing techniques.\n\nThe story of the creation of the soap opera Crossroads was full of roadblocks\nas competing political agendas, tribal affiliations, ethnic tensions and aesthetic conflicts all rose to the surface. This project describes and analyses the genealogy of the process. It also looks at the ways the local population understood the series over the four year period it was broadcast. Often the messages received were far from the messages ostensibly conveyed.\n\n\n\n\n\nT</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>27482</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/G009325/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4A856E02-8C94-4981-B572-E381EEB60DD2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Media</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>46E85C19-DECF-4873-978B-4B57CA5EAC7B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Television HTC</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
