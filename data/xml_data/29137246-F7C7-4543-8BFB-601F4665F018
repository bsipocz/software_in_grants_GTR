landscapes</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Fellowship</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>NE/M006840/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This project will build a KE network of stakeholders from academia, industry, policy, and conservation in order to translate NERC research findings into practice and policy for ensuring the sustainability of tropical agricultural landscapes under climate change. 

Tropical landscapes perform multiple functions, including providing food, supporting the highest concentrations of biodiversity globally, and providing essential ecosystem services, including storing vast amounts of carbon within rainforests. All these functions impact globally and are under increasing pressure from human population growth. There is a large and growing body of scientific evidence to aid decision-making about the sustainable management of tropical landscapes, but this information is rarely available to decision makers and practitioners charged with developing and implementing best practice. The role of the KE fellow will be to bridge the gap between academia and other sectors to facilitate more informed decision-making. The development of sustainable tropical landscapes relies on multiple and diverse stakeholders, often with competing priorities, therefore the KE fellowship aims to provide a robust and consistent evidence-base across sectors.

The first phase of the fellowship will focus on improving sustainability of oil palm dominated landscapes in SE Asia. Oil palm is the world's primary source of vegetable oil, and SE Asia is responsible for 80% of global production. The fellow already has extensive technical knowledge of the subject from previous KE projects, and has developed a diverse network of contacts of important stakeholders, including: the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm oil (RSPO) - the certification body for sustainable palm oil, Unilever - the largest single user of palm oil globally, and Proforest - an NGO responsible for the development of the 'High Conservation Values' (HCV) process (see letters of support) .The fellow will use this existing knowledge and contacts to deliver targeted KE on urgent and emerging issues. 

The second phase of the programme will expand the scope of KE to include new regions, crops and research topics to maximise the KE output from NERC-funded tropical research at York. The final phase of the project will place KE activities in the context of climate change to ensure the safeguarding of food security, natural resources and ecosystem services in the face of environmental change. It will also create a KE legacy, by putting in place mechanisms to ensure that KE continues to flow between academia and decision-makers beyond the lifetime of the project.

By delivering the four project objectives, the fellow will bridge the gap between academia, industry, government and NGOs. This approach will ensure the incorporation of NERC science into policy and practice, to achieve progress towards effectively balancing the multiple functions of tropical landscapes. KE activities will include building contacts through visits to stakeholders in the UK and in the focal tropical countries, and development and maintenance of effective communication tools. Two multi-sector workshops will highlight issues and challenges, while encouraging collaboration across sectors. Focus topics for KE will be identified for which the relevant scientific evidence will be synthesised and disseminated by the fellow in a variety of ways ranging from synthesis reports to podcasts. In addition, three secondments are planned. Each secondment will target a different sector and will enable the fellow to work closely with individual organisations to deliver scientific knowledge which is tailored according to targeted needs.

By these means the programme will facilitate more efficient uptake of scientific evidence into policy and practice, ultimately benefiting society through safeguarding food security, biodiversity and ecosystem services under a changing climate.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>147189</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Van Hall Larenstein University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Netherlands, Kingdom of the</gtr:country><gtr:description>SEnSOR programme</gtr:description><gtr:id>FFFA8242-1DE8-4B1D-B680-8A4FBE951D28</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Continued funding for research and knowledge exchange activities

We ran the 3 day workshop in Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia in November 2016. I led the third day in which I brought guest speakers from industry, NGOs and policy to speak to the Early careers researchers about their perspectives on how environmental research could be helpful in decision making and improving oil palm sustainability. I also ran a training session on how to create impact for your research as an early career researcher, and another session on stakeholder mapping.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Oxford</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Plant Sciences</gtr:department><gtr:description>NERC Human Modified tropical Forests programme</gtr:description><gtr:id>076D6683-DCAB-4F55-BB56-5B98ED261B08</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This partnership has only just commenced.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b95f149ba075.10521436-4</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>University of Oxford Zoology department is now hosting me, and I will be able to access KE allocated funding associated with the HMTF porject to deliver KE.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>As a result of my success in Knowledge Exchange with the oil palm industry I transferred my KE fellowship to the University of Oxford and I am now working with the NERC HMTF consortium to deliver knowledge exchange for their research outputs.

So far in my fellowship highlights from my policy work include:
I have ensured NERC science has been cited and influenced decision making in the High Carbon Stock Study and the High Carbon Stock Approach Toolkit.

I have co-developed a forest integrity assessment tool for the High Conservation Value Assessors Licensing Scheme which was tested for robustness using NERC generated data- this tool is used by HCV assessors and is improving HCV assessment to increase sustainability of the oil palm industry through avoided habitat loss. 

I have increased the reach of NERC science to decision makers in the oil palm industry through my science-for-policy briefs in association with the SEnSOR project, and through my collaboration with Zoological Society of London to improve content on their SPOTT website for the oil palm industry.

My work on the Roundtable on sustainable palm oil Biodiversity working group and compensation task force has ensured that the evidence base (including NERC science) has influenced the development of evidence based compensation procedures and ensured the effectiveness of compensation project proposed by international oil palm growers.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>F2867A60-28AE-49BC-92B8-D13FA7912CE4</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56df17fb5236c1.59127888</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>As a result of my knowledge exchange activities I conducted a new synthesis of fragmentation research in oil palm landscapes to develop a new set of recommendations for assessing viable forest patch size for land planning and designing new conservation set asides.

This assessment is publicly accessible and approved for use by the HCV Assessors licensing scheme and companies or other organisations who need to assess the conservation value of SE Asian forest areas.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b95b0a8f8d28.67296658</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.hcvnetwork.org/resources/forest-integrity-assessment-tool</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>HCV resource network consultation for risk mapping to developing simplified smallholder High conservation value process</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>95E6D3E2-792E-45D9-834C-7FCC7C252B63</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58b95617c996f6.20200557</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.hcvnetwork.org</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>RSPO compensation panel</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4A2FB90B-FBB9-4B8F-8753-D486E769CDB9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>My recommendations and advice we adopted by two oil palm companies for the development and implemenation of their compensation projects (conservation projects to compensate for historic land clearance)</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b956c8926395.69528879</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Development of RSPO Compensation procedures</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>094EDC4C-8496-4B85-B971-23D85CA930F9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As a member of the Roundtable of Sustainable Palm oil (RSPO) Biodvierity and High COnservation Value Working group and RSPO Compensation task force, I was influential in developing the Compensation procedure- the procedure for companies who are out of compliance with RSPO standards due to histric land clearance without the appropriate environmental assessments. In particular I developed the priorities for compensation project section with SEARRP and BORA and personally drafted the section on the definition of &amp;quot;knowledge-based&amp;quot;- to ensure that the evidence base is drawn upon in every compensation project that is developed. This procedure is being used by all RSPO member companies who have compensation liability.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b95c828ae291.24567269</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.rspo.org/key-documents/supplementary-materials</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C9C041EB-2263-43A6-B9A7-CFEA0B253514</gtr:id><gtr:title>Co-benefits for biodiversity and carbon in land planning decisions within oil palm landscapes</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/98b02abd7601f9d3140095b807bf81c7"><gtr:id>98b02abd7601f9d3140095b807bf81c7</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>JM Lucey</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58b84a40495905.56615423</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>731D6322-6606-4260-B1CF-67DFB1D7FEFD</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Potential for Oil palm Landscapes to Support At Risk Species</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2ff1cd25984d6d51e64dfd7b72851118"><gtr:id>2ff1cd25984d6d51e64dfd7b72851118</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>KL Yeong</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58b848899db417.44013055</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>44409632-2D9A-4129-9E23-204949564CEA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Reframing the evidence base for policy-relevance to increase impact: a case study on forest fragmentation in the oil palm sector</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Applied Ecology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d8772473d46797982e32d802efa41f7e"><gtr:id>d8772473d46797982e32d802efa41f7e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lucey J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58b82f6e102dd3.01494028</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0D44DDE3-9E4E-41C6-B04D-77C39C4DF23C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Assessing forest Integrity: a preliminary test of a new, easy-to- use field methodology</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/2ff1cd25984d6d51e64dfd7b72851118"><gtr:id>2ff1cd25984d6d51e64dfd7b72851118</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>KL Yeong</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58b8496b1020f4.70908507</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/M006840/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:parents><gtr:parent><gtr:id>29137246-F7C7-4543-8BFB-601F4665F018</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>NE/M006840/1</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>147189.52</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2016-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:children><gtr:child rel="Transfer"><gtr:id>DDE1202F-7961-4A48-9947-704D502C8005</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>NE/M006840/2</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>72785.38</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2018-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:children/></gtr:child></gtr:children></gtr:parent></gtr:parents></gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5B25B6A3-B218-4F11-8A9D-661236DF455C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agri-environmental science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Climate &amp; Climate Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>1A1A6805-9DC4-4BCE-BC70-9F2AA4FD093B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ecol, biodivers. &amp; systematics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>794345CD-A1D5-4984-ADDD-088BCF41822F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agricultural systems</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Climate &amp; Climate Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5020ECC8-E0E8-434D-BDD5-663A9C04EFA2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Conservation Ecology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8D5E20EB-F470-4A70-9B72-5D68D7AFB1EB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Nat Resources, Env &amp; Rural Dev</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
