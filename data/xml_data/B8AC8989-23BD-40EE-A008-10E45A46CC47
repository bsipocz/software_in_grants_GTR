It is concerned with the mathematical analysis of differential equations (equations which model the physical world). This year's Equadiff has two strands: plenary talks which survey the state of the art in the subject, and research minisymposia.

This proposal is for the funding of fifteen invited research minisymposia at the conference. The themes of the minisymposia are chosen in areas in which classical UK strengths will attract new international collaborations or in areas in which the UK is underrepresented and will benefit from international expertise.

The plenary lectures and summaries of the research carried out at the minisymposia will be published in a special issue of an academic journal.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The Equadiff meeting can be seen as part of a medium-term strategy for addressing a weakness in the UK academic community identified in the 2004 International Review of Mathematics. This finding relates to the fields of analysis and partial differential equations. The review found that the UK did not train enough young researchers in this area, and this situation has led to the UK importing much of its academic knowledge here. The EPSRC has addressed this issue by creating centres of excellence in the area, and the Equadiff meeting - the premier European conference in the field - affords the UK the opportunity to showcase its talent and advertise our eagerness to interact and collaborate with our overseas partners.

More specifically:

- the meeting itself can help inspire young mathematicians for the field by allowing them to make their own presentations and to interact with international experts. In the medium term these young mathematicians will become established academics and reduce the need to import human resource in this area.

- established researchers in traditional UK strength fields as well as individuals in the weakness area are given the opportunity to interact with international experts in mathematical analysis.

Taken together, these points have the potential to enhance the competitiveness of the UK in mathematics.

Furthermore, the individual research minisymposia at the Equadiff conference are all in applications-related areas. Some have obvious connections with biology or industry (e.g. neuroscience), while others develop algorithms which may be of wider importance in science and industry (e.g. in developing algorithms for solving equations analytically or numerically) or in the general applied knowledge base (e.g. pattern formation). Individual minisymposium organisers are required to produce summaries of the research in their topics for wider dissemination.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-11-08</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-08-09</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>18709</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/J006343/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>02B9E893-AC2F-436D-BF88-28E1AC827F5D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Continuum Mechanics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>93E27C3B-6D00-4F18-BBE3-96C05C8F92B2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Non-linear Systems Mathematics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
