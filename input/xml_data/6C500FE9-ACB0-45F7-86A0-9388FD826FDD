This is a large project, and following a successful application in Phase I of the STFC-NARIT collaboration we anticipate applying for continued funding for a further two years in Phase II. The priority of the first year will be a requirements analysis and prototype of critical parts of the proposed system for benchmarking against the existing Liverpool Telescope systems. This will naturally lead into a two-year programme of software development, with delivery in 2020.

Thailand has a burgeoning astronomical community and an impressive array of existing infrastructure, along with an established engineering team for the support of operations. However, since much of their equipment has been purchased from external suppliers some of the systems are poorly understood. The TNT control systems for example are based around a proprietary, closed source software, and their network of 0.7 metre telescopes have also been supplied with an entirely different, dedicated interface. This is a risk for the long term stability of these facilities, compromises productivity and limits the ability of the NARIT team to provide upgrades to the current system.

The ARI owns and operates the LT, with operational support from STFC. This facility has a bespoke and established telescope control system (TCS), which is well documented, well understood and with source code available. However, by modern standards it is out-dated, having been developed from the VMS-based system in use on the Isaac Newton Group telescope for some decades. The ARI intends to build within the next decade the Large Robotic Telescope (LRT): a new, 4-metre class robotic telescope, and so will need to develop new control software for this facility. It will obviously be desirable to build a versatile, modular system which could also be deployed on the existing LT, bringing enhanced reliability and control via modern technologies. Many astrometric libraries in modern languages such as Python have now been developed and a new Linux based TCS using such libraries would be open and maintainable, and applicable to a range of infrastructure.

There is therefore scope for a collaborative project which will deliver a control framework which can be deployed on a variety of different facilities. The end product will be a system which will be used on facilities owned by both partners. The project can be fairly easily divided into two components based on the capabilities and expertise of the two partners. There are two levels of telescope control: the low-level 'fast loop' software control which drives the servos for the individual axes and the higher-level 'slow loop' control software which deals with the astrometry, converting RAs and DECs into axis positions and velocities with timestamps. The 'fast loop' work for the Thai telescopes will be led by the NARIT engineering team, with support from local expertise such as experienced mechatronics engineers at the Thai-German Institute. The higher level 'slow loop' work will be led at the ARI, where there is existing expertise and established systems for the benchmarking and testing of new technologies.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project seeks to meet UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4 through high quality technical, vocational and tertiary education as a route to economic development. Thailand is an example of a nation suffering from the `middle income trap', in which their economy has developed to the point where their competitive edge in exports of goods has been blunted by rising wages, but they cannot yet compete in high-value added sectors with more developed economies. Increased technical, vocational and tertiary education is one route towards escaping the trap, developing the technical skills within the workforce necessary for an advanced, innovation driven society. 

Thailand have developed a National Science, Technology and Innovation Policy and Plan, covering 2012 to 2021, in which technology, engineering and computing are highlighted as key areas for development. Astronomy in particular is understood as a powerful and cost-effective way to drive economic advancement. Not only do astronomy research programmes have an inspirational impact for young students considering science and technology careers, but more directly it provides skills and training which are applicable in other sectors, leading increased economic development and supporting the growth of a high-technology society.

The project proposed here is the beginning of a collaborative development of new telescope control software, which will ultimately be deployed on both NARIT and STFC-funded facilities. Existing software on the Thai National Telescope and 0.7m Thai robotic telescope network are closed-source and poorly documented. New software will enhance the scientific and outreach potential of these existing facilities, and the shared development will build within Thailand the software expertise required for the development of systems for future facilities such as the proposed Thai radio telescopes (SDG 9: enhancing research, upgrading technological capabilities and encouraging domestic technology development). This project will also build links between NARIT and local industry within Thailand, with a collaboration with the Thai-German Institute in order to develop the low-level, servo control aspects of the software. There is a clear overlap between the high precision mechatronics skills needed for telescope control systems and Thailand's industries in areas such as automobile control systems and high precision machining, and strengthening the links between industry and academia within Thailand is an important goal of the project, providing scope for internal knowledge transfer as well as between the UK and Thailand (SDG 8: promoting economic productivity through technology upgrading and innovation to focus on high-value added sectors).

The importance of outreach is recognised as being of fundamental importance at the ARI, which is home to the National Schools Observatory. Similarly, NARIT places outreach at the core of its programme. A key benefit of the project proposed here is an enhancement of the schools engagement programme within Thailand. The TNT is used as an educational tool, and the primary purpose of the 0.7m network is educational outreach. Development of new control systems is a key step towards taking operation of the telescopes out of the visitor centre and directly into the classroom: comparable to the model via which usage of the LT is offered to schools in the UK through the NSO. This enables both wider access as well as increased depth to the educational offering: permanent access in the classroom provides scope for long term projects and assessment activities.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>83843</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/P005659/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>615BB43C-305A-47B9-B728-7A9BB0BBE1A4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Astronomy - observation</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9D5D7750-2219-46D2-A182-083B2DEC8C63</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Astron. &amp; Space Sci.
