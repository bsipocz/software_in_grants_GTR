Although trees dominate these ecosystems, creating a complex habitat that shelters many species while shading out many others, this dominance relies on a hidden relationship with fungi. These fungi are rarely seen but their thread-like filaments, called hyphae, are intertwined among the roots of trees, forming a close symbiosis that helps both tree and fungus grow - a mutualistic interaction. Both organisms need carbohydrates and minerals to grow and, while trees excel at capturing and storing carbon from the air, the tiny hyphae of fungi excel at extracting water and nutrients, like nitrogen and phosphorus, from the soil. The amounts exchanged between trees and fungi is extremely high: all of the carbon in a fungus can be obtained directly from its partner trees, while most of the nitrogen in a tree comes directly from its partner fungi. The diverse groups of fungi involved are called ectomycorrhizal (or ECM) fungi, after the modified fine roots, or ectomycorrhizas, where the tree and fungus join each other.

These symbiotic relationships are remarkably common: the majority of European trees depend on ECM fungi and there are many different fungi that form these relationships. Some of these fungi are well known for their sexual fruiting bodies, for example the poisonous fly agaric toadstools and the edible truffles and penny bun mushrooms. However, we know worryingly little about the diversity of ectomycorrhizal fungi. While some fungi may grow with a wide variety of trees and other plants, others may be specialists restricted to closely related tree species. And while around 8,000 species of ECM fungi have been described, there may be many more undiscovered. In addition, we largely ignore the geographic ranges of these fungi. Some may be widely distributed, but others may be restricted to a handful of small locations. We do know that at least some can invade in other continents and that others may be locally extinct. Most worryingly of all, we know that ectomycorrhizal fungi are sensitive to environmental change, particularly pollution and changes in rainfall and temperature. But we do not know how these observations translate to changes at large geographical scales.

Here we propose to fill the gap in our understanding of the wider diversity and distribution of tree-fungi symbioses, and help focus our selection of experimental and genetic models. In order to do this, we put forward the use of one of the most extensive biomonitoring plot networks on Earth in which the effects of pollution and changes in forest soil quality have been closely monitored. We aim to use these plots to carry out the first precise mapping of mycorrhizal fungi across Europe's three major forest types: beech, Scots pine and Norway spruce. At each of 150 intensively-monitored plots, we will use optimised molecular ecology techniques to obtain DNA sequences from ectomycorrhizas. Once we know who and where are the dominant fungi in Europe, we intend to use the monitored data from the plots along with the latest environmental change predictions to understand the processes that control these hidden symbioses and their likely fate in our changing world.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Engagement with potential users has been taking place so that the research proposed can directly answer their needs. This project was co-initiated with enthusiastic members of the British and European forest biomonitoring community and it follows from two collaborative workshops and four collaborative peer-reviewed publications. To sustain that momentum and maximise its potential is the aim of this impact plan. In addition to scientific conferences and departmental seminars, scientific and popular journal publications, and reports to relevant organisations, further impact will be through ongoing formal and informal interactions among the PI, Co-I, post-doctoral fellow, technician, postgraduates, undergraduates, members of the advisory team, international fungal research networks, national forestry contact points and the foresters on the ground. All of these are essential to the continued success, relevance and evolution of the research project. 

Remarkably, the European Atlas of Soil Biodiversity (2010) does not include a single non-animal distribution map, even though many soil fungi are large, long-lived, commercially harvested, affected by environmental change and functionally important organisms. The project proposed here can be the first to address this major knowledge gap in a systematic way. Shifting the research focus from local to large-scale effects is critical to managing future biodiversity and ecosystem services. This is a question- and hypothesis-driven proposal that opens up what is generally acknowledged to be still a big black box in ecology, at an unprecedented geographic scale, level of replication and accuracy. This proposal is the outcome of workshops with scientists from several disciplines and biomonitoring experts, detailed written input from 22 experts, multi-authored review and opinion publications, and a proof-of-concept study. Due to the success of the proof-of-concept study in a diverse subset of forest biomonitoring plots, we developed this proposal through stakeholder engagement and scientific consultation. Therefore, here we propose an optimised approach that represents both value for money and high impact: it offers high replication at all levels, uses long-term plots with detailed existing data, allows cutting-edge macroecological analyses, and has many potential short- and long-term spin-offs.

We will use the following as our measures of impact:
a) Formation of an ICP Forests expert sub-panel on mycorrhizas.
b) Numbers of visits to project web pages.
c) Checking with advisory group that stakeholder needs are met.
d) Number of undergraduate and postgraduate students trained through the proposed project and the number that decide to pursue studies or careers in project-related fields.
e) Numbers of people reached via popular science publications and interviews.
f) Numbers of adults and children engaged at Kew-based and school-based activities.
g) Circulation of scientific and general audience reports.
h) High-impact scientific publications and number of non-self citations.
i) Invitations to present results at national and international scientific and public meetings.
j) Securing funding for follow-up research from national and international sources.
k) Inclusion of mycorrhizas in the European Commission Joint Research Centre's European Atlas of Soil Biodiversity.

Progress in these measures of impact will be evaluated at the following two major project milestones: at 1.5 years and at six months prior to the project's end. These milestones will take the form of conference calls among team members and the advisory group members, followed by summary reports to be made available for wider input on the ICP Forests Blog within one week and mailed to stakeholders for comments.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-08-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>367845</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>We are still gathering data, at this point 103 sites across Europe have been sampled and the data is being analyzed.
