Nuclear power, like all other forms of energy, generates waste, including high-level radioactive waste and spent fuel (SF). No environmentally and politically satisfactory solution has yet been implemented anywhere in the world for the disposal of spent fuel. The main problem with spent fuel is the high radiogenic heating. Disposal in a mined, engineered repository such the Swedish KBS-3 concept or similar designs proposed for the UK and some other European countries would require prolonged periods of post-reactor cooling and even then would place severe constraints on the engineered barriers. Over the last decade, we (Gibb, Travis, McTaggart &amp;amp; co-workers at the University of Sheffield) have developed an alternative concept for dealing with SF, particularly the high burn-up SF likely to be removed from GEN III reactors in new-build power stations. This alternative is based on very deep disposal in geological boreholes. Deep borehole disposal which utilises an order of magnitude increase in the geological barrier (over and above a mined repository) is potentially a safer option for SF, could be implemented faster and at a fraction of the cost of a repository. The proposed research programme is to further develop borehole disposal such that we greatly extend its applicability to enable the safe, efficient long term disposal of a much wider range of SFs from very young hot fuel to older, legacy SFs.

Our current borehole disposal concept for high heat-generating SFs would utilise a special lead-based alloy, employed as a fine shot. This material is designed to support the load of an overlying stack of waste containers and, through radiogenic heating by the waste, becomes fluid and fills any remaining crevices in and around the borehole, forming a permanent seal, and extra barrier upon subsequent cooling. This system is not a universal catch-all; for some waste loadings, insufficient heat will be generated to melt the shot, e.g. during disposal of older fuel . We are seeking to extend the flexibility of our disposal scheme to all SFs by developing a geothermal cement as an alternative to the lead-based alloy support matrix. 

The proposed research will identify a range of candidate geothermal cements based on heat flow modelling of typical borehole disposal scenarios. Our experienced team which includes: an international expert in geothermal cements, Dr Neil Milestone; the originator of our deep borehole concept for spent fuel disposal, Professor Fergus Gibb; and an expert in multiscale modelling, Dr Karl Travis, will conduct a programme of experimentally based research to reduce the list of candidate cements by measuring important properties such as viscosity, setting time, durability and geochemistry. If no suitable material is found, an attempt will be made to use the results of the investigation to develop one that is fit for purpose. It is highly probable that a successful outcome would yield a product with applications in other areas of nuclear waste packaging and disposal as well as the hydrocarbon and geothermal drilling industries.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The wider national &amp;amp; international impact is for the energy crisis and climate change through facilitating the continued and expanded use of carbon-free nuclear energy, to which the principle obstacle is how to deal with the wastes, especially spent fuel (SF) and reprocessing HLW.
The main impact is for the development of deep borehole disposal (DBD) as a potentially safer, more cost-effective and environmentally sound alternative to mined and engineered repositories for disposal of SF, HLW and possibly Pu. The impact is likely to occur soonest in the USA where, with the demise of the federal repository at Yucca Mountain, the problem of SF is acute and the Presidential Blue Ribbon Commission has focussed attention on DBD as a way forward. Our pioneering research in DBD has led to our involvement in a US DOE-funded consortium led by Sandia NL to research and develop DBD and take it through to a practical demonstration. A successful outcome to the proposed research on cement, while not part of this consortium's work, has the potential to feed into it and widen the options for the engineered barrier systems and for the range of wastes that could be managed by DBD.
In the UK, in response to a Government request to consider options for acceleration of the MRWS programme, NDA has acknowledged a possible role for DBD, especially for the early disposal of vitrified reprocessing HLW. The specific objective of the proposed research is to develop a fit-for-purpose cement grout aimed at DBD of the UK's inventory of reprocessing HLW (and possibly older SF) but, since DBD is, as yet, outside RWMD's remit the intended impact is more likely to occur in the longer term. However, as part of their brief to maintain awareness of new technologies, NDA and RWMD have already expressed interest. Given the scale and urgency of the UK's 'legacy waste' problem, the impact of the work could be considerable.
Secondary, but important, impacts could be elsewhere in the nuclear industry and in the hydrocarbon and geothermal energy industries where the problems of cementing and sealing wells are well known. 
Currently, cements are used extensively in the nuclear industry for grouting wastes into their containers and it is proposed to use similar materials in proposed GDF concepts where elevated temperatures could prevail. While existing formulations are deemed satisfactory in the former context, they are not ideal in that their flow/void filling properties could be better and they do not perform well with reactive metal wastes. Clearly, the development of a cement grout with better flow, setting and performance characteristics (as required for DBD use) could spin off to applications in this area.
The main use of cements in the oil and gas industry is for grouting casing to seal wells. While commercially available well cements are generally satisfactory they can fail with serious consequences under the more extreme conditions being increasingly encountered as hydrocarbon exploration probes further and deeper, e.g., BP's Deepwater Horizon disaster, which has led to litigation against the cement supplier. Geothermal energy wells nearly always have to be sealed by casing and grouting to prevent fluid loss and erosion of the wall rock. Conventional geothermal cements usually prove adequate in the short term, but in the harsher and more aggressive chemical environments increasingly being exploited, e.g. in New Zealand, failure and loss of the well can occur within a few years. A successful outcome to the proposed research to develop a grout that can perform satisfactorily in the severe, high temperature and pressure conditions of DBD could lead to improved formulations to resolve serious problems in both the hydrocarbon and geothermal drilling industries as they seek to push the envelope ever further.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-04-03</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-11-04</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>424704</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Callaghan Innovation</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>New Zealand</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaborative work with Callaghan Innovation in New Zealand</gtr:description><gtr:id>6B75D106-8243-456B-9E7E-8A20C443DB94</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation and publication associated with the Material Research Society (MRS).

All 3 researchers: PI, CI and PDRA will make presentations at the American Nuclear Society conference next April in South Carolina. We are preparing for submission a total of 5 papers as a result of these conference talks.

The CI and PDRA were invited as Panel Members to attend the US Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board (NWTRB) International Technical Workshop on Deep Borehole Disposal of Radioactive Waste. This was a prestigious invitation from a US Department of Energy organisation. Both invitees gave presentations and the PDRA was a member of a chaired discussion session where panel members responded to queries put to them by the NWTRB. The PDRA was also invited to be the spokesperson for this panel.

The PDRA was invited by the International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) to attend an Expert Mission to Slovakia to advise two Slovakian organisations (Vuje and Javys) on the possible use of DBD in Slovakia, as well as methods to dispose of intermediate level nuclear waste.

The PDRA visited the National Nuclear Laboratory to present and discuss his work, as well as the wider research being performed by the Sheffield group on developing DBD. He also presented his work to the Advanced Materials group in Callaghan Innovation, New Zealand, during his work placement.

The PI, CI and PDRA all visited Marriott Drilling (a project partner) and the PDRA presented his work to the management of the company. Technical aspects of the overall work being performed in the group at Sheffield were discussed, as well as further collaboration. This visit strengthened collaborative ties with the company. The PDRA has also presented his work at two open day meetings with The University of Leeds, and at The University of Sheffield Department of Materials Science and Engineering open day.

The PI and PDRA are organising a meeting entitled International Meeting on DBD of High-Level Radioactive Waste, to be held in Sheffield on 13th-15th June 2016. This is the first international meeting of its kind focussed specifically on the topic of DBD, and will host keynote speakers and invited talks from top international experts in their fields and from a range of countries (including the UK, USA, New Zealand, Korea, Sweden, Switzerland and Germany).</gtr:description><gtr:id>CBE0DFAC-317E-406C-91C4-E739DA3021B7</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54622158b4bc45.17127999</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Energy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Resulting from the experimental laboratory work carried out during the placement at Callaghan Innovation, as well as from the work performed since returning to The University of Sheffield, we have discovered and developed the following points:
- Two types of cementitious grouts containing organic retarders capable of operating across the range of temperatures and pressures likely to be experienced during the Deep Borehole Disposal (DBD) of high-level waste (HLW) have been developed. These two types of grout have been selected for further laboratory-scale testing which is currently being performed, and which will continue for the remainder of the grant funding period.
- Laboratory testing of other grouts containing inorganic retarders has been performed and has demonstrated that these grouts are only capable of operating at low DBD temperatures. This work is continuing in order to try and identify more appropriate inorganic materials.
- Organic additives are also been investigated/developed in order to facilitate the grouts to flow through water at DBD temperatures and pressures, and this work will continue for the duration of the grant funding period.
Overall, the work performed to date has demonstrated that cementitious grouts can be used for this DBD application, and the grouts currently being developed should be fit for purpose in the actual DBD process. The experimental work has also shown that further larger-scale work carried out at representative temperatures and pressures is required in order to take the developmental process further and facilitate efficient production of a workable product(s) for use in the actual DBD process.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Controlling the setting and hardening performance of wet cementitious pastes at high temperature and pressure, as well as hardened paste composition and durability, will be of great use to the hydrocarbon and geothermal energy industries.
