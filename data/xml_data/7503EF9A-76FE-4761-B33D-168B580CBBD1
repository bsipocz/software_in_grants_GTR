&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>promote the transfer and exchange of knowledge between academic departments and business organisations and the staff employed within them; 
&lt;/li>
 &lt;li>provide business organisations with research-informed evidence to develop and review operational and management practices; 
&lt;/li>
 &lt;li>expand networks for business organisations into academic and vice-versa; 
&lt;/li>
 &lt;li>enable all parties, including ESRC, to develop their understanding of the interaction between research and the development of operational and management practices in private sector organisations.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>These aims will be achieved in two ways. First, via the organisation of a high-level workshop that will bring together a small number of leading academics who are actively involved in researching environmental management in business with senior private sector executives from the travel and tourism sector.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The second stage will involve a research project to understand much more fully than at present the factors that facilitate business engagement with academic research in this sector.&amp;nbsp; It will explore, but not be limited to, novel methods of dissemination by academics and issues of developing competence to 'read' academic research among senior executives.&lt;/p>

In this role, I have created a new membership category (for universities) and a package of activities and offers. Small seed-corn grants have been made available to pump prime research and we have established a programme of round-table events where academics present their work to interested practitioners. I will lead one of these sessions on research I have undertaken (with Dr Emma Wood) on innovation.

This reflects an important shift in attitude from leaders of a sector that has traditionally had very little contact with research or researchers from higher education institutions. The impact of the Follow-on funding is reported separately. In addition, Leeds Metropolitan University/ Leeds Beckett University developed a joint undergraduate and postgraduate distance learning programme that was informed by both constituencies. Those programmes have started recruiting.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2009</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>5E9B6AB2-0530-4333-8D82-FDFA6AD201E0</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5458c42c5ada38.14082795</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>A) The project provided an insight into the potential value of university research for business practice to several business elites working in tourism (those in very senior positions within large corporations). A positive disposition towards universities among business elites has a potentially high impact because not only do they control significant organisational resources but are also opinion formers across the sector. B) The research capacity and capability of universities was promoted to the tourism sector via the newsletter and web sites of the Institute of Travel and Tourism (ITT) and the trade press. Anecdotal evidence suggests that requests for business-university collaboration has increased. C) The Board of the ITT decided to extend their connection with academics by investing in and supporting an application for Follow-on Funding with the ESRC (an application that was successful). This reflects an important shift in attitude from leaders of a sector that has traditionally had very little contact with research or researchers from higher education institutions. D) My personal links with business elites have been strengthened considerably. This has resulted in discussions about further collaboration (in part reflected in the new Follow-on Project). E) The four academic colleagues who made presentations at a round-table event have also been given an opportunity to engage with business actors that are notoriously difficult to reach.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings will be taken forward in three ways:
1. A follow-on project. This has been delivered successfully. See ES/I01585X/1
2. I am currently planning a research project that will examine how business elites narrate their work and involvement with universities.
3. I am preparing an application for funding for a seminar series that will bring together senior executives and academics with an interest in engagement and impact.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>EA84E43D-AAF4-439A-9CA4-F5B8EC825925</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5458c27817c630.86005639</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.esrc.ac.uk/my-esrc/grants/RES-186-27-0015/outputs/Read/bdf99603-2139-4ada-a178-7ec26d8f868b</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A6929638-9F10-440D-970A-E411B6871C93</gtr:id><gtr:title>Business elites, universities and knowledge transfer in tourism</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Tourism Management</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ec7682933d5d8a2433bc162e9bb0e1fc"><gtr:id>ec7682933d5d8a2433bc162e9bb0e1fc</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Thomas R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cfb3fb32980db4</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>EA3BE16A-F163-45F4-9F1C-B9DA81AF2CA6</gtr:id><gtr:title>Research and scholarship with impact: a British perspective</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Worldwide Hospitality and Tourism Themes</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ec7682933d5d8a2433bc162e9bb0e1fc"><gtr:id>ec7682933d5d8a2433bc162e9bb0e1fc</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Thomas R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>r_4954355791cb1d6f38</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-186-27-0015</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">RES-186-27-0015</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
