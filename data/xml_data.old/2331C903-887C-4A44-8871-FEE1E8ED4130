A recent global survey indicated that 85% of zebrafish (Danio rerio) labs use the technique. With an estimated 3,250 zebrafish facilities worldwide, each genotyping 100s-1000s of animals per year, this equates to millions of procedures annually, and this figure is likely to increase dramatically with the utility the zebrafish model for CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. Yet, despite its routine use as an SOP, fin clipping has the potential to impact fish welfare by causing them pain, altering their physiology, swimming ability or other behaviour, and increasing the subsequent risk of pathogen infections. Furthermore, the biological effects of anaesthesia potentially impact the quality of behavioural, physiological and other data derived from fin-clipped fish. The identification of refinements to standard DNA sampling SOPs to improve animal welfare is therefore warranted, both ethically and scientifically.

An alternative approach for sampling the DNA of aquatic vertebrates involves swabbing the skin surface. We recently developed a reliable swabbing technique that provides sufficient DNA for PCR reactions from different zebrafish strains and sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) &amp;gt;20mm. However, while swabbing appears to offer a less invasive alternative, it still requires fish to be netted, held in air and handled; procedures that themselves are potentially stressful. Therefore, despite its putative advantages, the potential of swabbing to provide a refinement to standard DNA collection protocols remain untested. In this project we will provide evidence on the nature and magnitude of any welfare benefits of swabbing over fin clipping. Such information is essential to validate the technique as a refinement, and assure its wider adoption by a growing community of researchers using fish as laboratory models.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Fin clipping under non-terminal anaesthesia is the SOP for sampling DNA from fish in lab studies. However, fin clipping causes pain and induces stress in fish, and the use of anaesthesia potentially impacts data quality. Globally, we estimate ca. 1M fish are fin-clipped each year. The recent development of skin swabbing techniques - which produce sufficient DNA for PCR amplification - potentially offers a refined procedure with enormous impact for fish welfare. Our group has recently developed such a technique for zebrafish that has been well received by the community. However, as swabbing still requires fish to be netted, air-exposed and restrained, the magnitude of any actual welfare benefits over fin clipping remain unquantified, and the value of swabbing as a refinement untested.

Our main aim is to test the hypothesis that swabbing has a significantly lower impact on stress-related behaviour and physiology than fin clipping, and so represents a valid refinement to current regulated procedures. We propose a series of experimental studies comparing the effects of swabbing and fin clipping on a range of indicators of stress and wellbeing. To demonstrate the potential for cross-species benefits, we will study both zebrafish and sticklebacks. We will expose fish to a range of control, swabbing or fin clipping treatments, designed to separate the effects of various components involved in each procedure, and quantify behavioural and physiological correlates of stress over appropriate timescales. We will additionally compare the effects of analgesia on the stress responses of fish subjected to swabbing and fin clipping, to investigate the relative pain associated with each approach. Finally, we will examine the potential of proprietary water treatments to provide further refinement to swabbing procedures. We will publicise our results to a wide network of end users to ensure that our recommendations are taken up by the community</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/66BB3CDB-84B4-41B5-AB21-FEC312E91CC8"><gtr:id>66BB3CDB-84B4-41B5-AB21-FEC312E91CC8</gtr:id><gtr:name>NC3Rs</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>258802</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NC/R001049/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
