This phase will examine parochial sites within the dioceses of St Andrews and Brechin.\nA great majority of Scottish parish churches now appear to be buildings of relatively modern date, and this has led to a view that very few are of interest to historians of medieval architecture or ecclesiastical history. Apart from the consequent neglect of a significant area of scholarship, this has had the practical consequence that a great deal of damage has been caused to the fabric and archaeology of churches on the mistaken assumption that there is no medieval work that might be at risk when invasive works are taking place.\nHowever, the Investigators involved in this project have become increasingly aware that many apparently modern buildings on medieval sites are likely either to contain significant elements of pre-Reformation structures, or were very closely conditioned by their medieval predecessors. \nIn order to test this idea a pilot study was carried out in the dioceses of Dunkeld and Dunblane, where there were 105 parishes. It was found that 14 wholly or partly roofed churches there have retained significant medieval work; 22 ruined churches have retained part of their medieval appearance; 14 churches appear to perpetuate the footprint of their pre-Reformation predecessors and are likely to incorporate some medieval work; and 22 churches are on the site of the medieval building, with a possibility that they incorporate medieval work. It was also found that medieval churches of rectangular plan (the great majority) have average proportions of 1:2.69, whereas the preferred proportion for post-Reformation churches was closer to 1:2. In the course of the work, a greater body of information on the medieval history of the parishes has been assembled than for any other part of Scotland, and much of this information is of relevance for our understanding of the buildings.\nHaving established an effective methodology, it is intended both to expand the scope of the survey and to test the findings of the pilot study by examining the churches and sites in the dioceses of St Andrews and Brechin. These dioceses offer a fascinating range of parochial types, many of which were planned on a more ambitious scale than the majority of those considered in the pilot study. The dioceses of St Andrews and Brechin embrace the majority of Scotland's great trading burghs, and include a number of major cathedral, monastic and collegiate churches that also served a parochial function.\nApart from the analyses of the buildings and the documentation of the individual parishes, there will therefore be scope for taking an overview of a number of themes. These will include the introduction of new ideas along trading routes and the artistic influences exerted by the major workshops.\nSince this promises to be a particularly rewarding phase of the overall project, and in view of the current shortage of scholarly expertise in this area, it is considered that the opportunity should be taken to offer training to young postgraduates. A proportion of the fieldwork and research will therefore be undertaken by a post-doctoral researcher working alongside one of the co-investigators for half the length of this phase and a PhD studentship will be attached to the project with a particular focus on the collegiate churches.\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The wider beneficiaries of the second phase of the project are expected to include:\nHistoric Scotland, the government agency that designates monuments and buildings, and that deals with casework \nUniversities, colleges and schools\nSites and monuments records of local authority planning and archaeology services\nChurch denominations using medieval buildings for worship, and the bodies responsible for controls under the measures for ecclesiastical exemption\nArchitects and other practitioners carrying out work on church buildings\nAmenity societies consulted on planning applications\nBodies with an interest in church buildings and their contents, including the Built Environment Forum for Scotland, Scottish Church Heritage Research, and the National Association of Decorative and Fine Art Societies\nMuseums presenting their local history \nLocal history and archaeology societies\nIndividuals interested in architecture and history.\nThe project will provide an authoritative body of analytical and pictorial information on the architecture and history of the churches.\nWhere beneficiaries are involved in decisions affecting the structure and archaeology of the church buildings, the information in the 'Corpus of Scottish Medieval Parish Churches' will ensure that decisions are based on thorough understanding of an increased number of architectural sites. Such information should be an essential prerequisite in the decision-making process at all historic structures, though relatively few of those involved in work on churches currently know how to access this information. Experience suggests that such understanding is particularly necessary in Scotland, since it is frequently not appreciated that an apparently modern building may embody medieval work, and that beneath ground levels may be evidence for a long sequence of building phases. Several bodies (including the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland, Maintain your church, Scottish Church Heritage Research and Perth and Kinross heritage Trust) have expressed their intention to provide hyperlinks to the current Corpus web site.\nBeyond those requiring information at a professional level, the investigators expect the electronic resource will foster a wider concern for the churches. The activities of several local societies demonstrate a considerable interest in Scotland's buildings and their history, though that interest is currently largely unsatisfied by available information. It has been heartening for the investigators to observe the response of many individuals and societies to the electronic resource resulting from the pilot project, and they expect that even greater interest will be generated by extending the project to further dioceses.\nThe experience acquired in the pilot project has been valuable in developing an understanding of how best to disseminate the information that will be gathered. This will involve:\n- Completing the second phase of the Corpus within the specified time\n- Making that resource as widely accessible as possible\n- Publishing further papers in national and local professional journals\n- Organising further research seminars leading to the sharing of information with those having related interests\n- Ensuring the electronic resources of national and local societies make their membership aware of the information on the project's electronic resource\n- Continuing to accept invitations to give lectures to national and local societies\n- Bringing the attention of the central bodies of the Churches to the resources produced by the project\n- Talking to church and parish groups\n- It is expected that the proposed additional graphical interface using maps will expand the audience by providing access to architectural sites within the context of their geographical environment.
