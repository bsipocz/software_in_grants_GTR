It combined analytic themes of ?time-space? (co-ordination) and life-course (biographical transitions) as a step towards measuring and interpreting abstract notions of ?well-being? and ?quality of life?.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Five seminars were held between December 2007 and September 2008. The strategy for participation actively engaged interest groups, practitioners and policymakers alongside academic participants from different UK and international contexts. This strategy ensured that a number of different groups representing older people, sustainable transport, slow-living, health information and mental health rights made contributions made their opinions and recommendations known.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The seminar series output included not only academic publications (a special issue of Environment and Planning A, 43.3, 2011) but also spin-off participatory action research including conversations about collaborative housing with older people and a slow-cities PhD studentship. The seminar series created a new space (open forum) in which to engage in and promote improved dialogue between narrowly quantitative and exclusively qualitative approaches to tracing daily routines.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-10-24</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-10-25</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>12483</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Meeting Objectives
? Creating a new space for dialogue which acknowledges cross-cutting research and policy concerns

This objective has been well met. Each of the seminars engaged with a discrete theme and attracted a wide audience which stretched the dialogue beyond the academy and a single institution or discipline. The spaces created for dialogue were both real and virtual. Seminars were held in five different sites in four cities. This variety was valuable in creating discretely different settings, contrasting the London HQ of the Royal Geographical Society, including scope for a practical demonstration and field activity using GPS in Kensington Gardens, with the studio setting of Newcastle University Culture Lab, with scope for a practical demonstration of ?motion capture?. Policy concerns were widely addressed but most notably in relation to schools, nutrition, ageing, health, transport and sustainable cities. 

? Compiling a data-base of international scholars and user-groups; Creating a web-site on which to post electronic resources

We now have an active JISCmail list of 120 individual subscribers across 47 institutions. Google Analytics ?dashboard? indicates 1,332 visits to the seminar series web-site by 806 individuals from 46 countries/territories (31% via search engines; 52% by direct reference through advertising and correspondence; 16% by referring sites). 

? Extending participation as widely as possible by funding postgraduate and non-profit user group travel

We provided 39 bursaries (a total of &amp;pound;2,650) rather than the suggested 25 (&amp;pound;1500) representing 10 bursaries to overseas postgraduates/ lower income scholars; 2 to participants of UK charities; 27 to UK postgraduates. The additional spending on bursaries was justified by the high level of demand from postgraduates engaging directly with the series. 

? Cultivating mixed methods, cross-disciplinary and international engagement 

This objective was met both through the international, multi-disciplinary profile of participants and the content of specific seminars. In particular, seminar 1 included participatory methods alongside quantitative cohort studies; seminar 2 highlighted competing approaches to everyday routines; seminar 3 incorporated hands-on experience of GPS; seminar 5 provided international comparisons. 
? Developing unusual interdisciplinary integrations

The series raised awareness of theorising in the area of time-space into a variety of everyday life issues such as transport activity, food intake and fitness as illustrated by publicity in practitioner magazines such as Network Health Dietician (Feb 2008; October 2009). Disciplines represented ? in addition to geography and sociology ? included computing science, digital media, health and nutrition, education, architecture and planning, economics, transport studies, theology, history and population studies. 

? Exploiting the potential for combining theories of life-course and time-space
Work is ongoing to meet this objective in relation to planned outputs from the series (see publications below). 

? Disseminating outputs from the seminars and related research to academics and user groups
In addition to disseminating seminar papers and notifying user academics and user groups of future publications via the web-site and JISCmail list the seminar series has prompted new and solidified existing collaborations (see activities below).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>CF2FE007-FE02-4873-8AAA-E7A47B4B1788</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54450cd28b5039.46223745</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>In addition to the seminars themselves we convened two meetings specifically for the purpose of exploiting the potential of the seminars for spin-off activities and publications output. Listed below is a sample selection of our ongoing activities and output. 
? We are publishing a collection of papers from the series as a theme issue on ?multiple scales of time-space and life-course? for Environment and Planning A (a submission date of January 2010 has been agreed with the journal editors for 2011 publication); 
? The editor of Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers (Alison Blunt) has invited us to submit a collective ?Boundary Crossing? commentary on the main themes and future directions from the series; 
? Amelia Lake is working on a special issue proposal for Health and Place to expand on themes of health and time-space; 
? We digitally recorded and have now transcribed the final seminar panel discussion as a stepping-off point for collective writing and analysis; 
? We are capitalising on our successful use of ICT for ?virtual? real-time debate (seminar 5) (making considerable savings to this award) to reduce the carbon footprint of subsequent regional and international network events;
? Christine Dunn is collaborating with Margaret Grieco and others on a ?head-loading? project, possibly also utilising ?motion capture? capabilities identified in seminar 5;
? Helen Jarvis recently accepted an unpaid advisory role for Cittaslow International, as a direct result of network activities;
? Christine Dunn and Rachel Pain are working with Vera Boulter of the Elders Council on a forthcoming ESRC application;
? Colin Pooley and Miles Tight are collaborating on an ongoing EPSRC programme.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We established a dedicated web-site: http://time-space-life-course.ncl.ac.uk/ 
The web-site was regularly updated and used both to advertise future seminars and to report on seminars that had taken place. We generated a JISCmail list of some 120 subscribers. We advertised forthcoming seminars via a number of existing mailing lists including crit-geog-forum which has 3000 subscribers internationally. Publicity at the host universities via departmental and institute mailing lists was effective at cultivating a high level of participation among postgraduates.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>CD28D45B-D7AB-48A9-9953-ADB05BE6BE86</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54450c78c213f8.47967882</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=TIME-SPACE-LIFE-COURSE;de2bb26a.0807</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6A9E000C-5140-4563-AC6D-E1883350F255</gtr:id><gtr:title>Saving Space, Sharing Time: Integrated Infrastructures of Daily Life in Cohousing</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Environment and Planning A</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a37abccff2e2aa1768733240d1aeb88b"><gtr:id>a37abccff2e2aa1768733240d1aeb88b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Jarvis H</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>54450dd3546c61.02754827</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1BC2EF9F-1A4B-4880-BF81-37A11147A371</gtr:id><gtr:title>Multiple Scales of Time&amp;acirc;??Space and Lifecourse</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Environment and Planning A</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a37abccff2e2aa1768733240d1aeb88b"><gtr:id>a37abccff2e2aa1768733240d1aeb88b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Jarvis H</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>54450d5f0edda8.42323411</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>45FDD471-5597-43C0-ABCF-115619087AD3</gtr:id><gtr:title>A Social Learning Tool - Barriers and Opportunities for Collective Occupant Learning in Low Carbon Housing</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Energy Procedia</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d68766fb46a382cae90120688d81d67e"><gtr:id>d68766fb46a382cae90120688d81d67e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Baborska-Narozny M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56d4b694cb3083.46756962</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>61562B3C-050B-4ED4-AD2D-081BEF64DC0E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Understanding youth transition as &amp;acirc;??Becoming&amp;acirc;??: Identity, time and futurity</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Geoforum</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7bbe046232ed4d00f68f975dfb446ded"><gtr:id>7bbe046232ed4d00f68f975dfb446ded</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Worth N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>54450e8cb90472.54240530</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E775863B-4D55-44B5-8A42-449FEDA72C3B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Anything, anywhere, anytime?
