One of the challenges clinicians face in treating people with psychotic disorders is that it is not possible to predict which patients are likely to experience a relapse. There is a need to better understand the factors which predispose to relapse to develop more personalised treatments which could be offered to patients who are at higher risk of developing a relapse.

Clinical information is increasingly recorded in electronic health records (EHRs) which include documentation by healthcare professionals on presenting symptoms, treatments and clinical outcomes. Most information regarding clinical presentation is documented as unstructured free text rather than in structured data fields. Natural language processing (NLP) is an automated text mining technique which allows large volumes of data to be quickly extracted from unstructured free text to analyse symptom profile data from EHRs.

There is growing interest in the use of digital technologies to improve health. Sensors built into smartphones which measure movement, location and mobile device usage can provide data on activity levels and social interaction which could predict adverse clinical outcomes before serious symptoms of mental illness develop.

In my fellowship, I will combine data from smartphone sensors with clinical information from electronic health records in people experiencing their first episode of psychosis. I will analyse the relationship between smartphone activity data and patterns of symptoms to develop and evaluate automated tools to predict relapse. Smartphones could provide an inexpensive means of monitoring fluctuations in mental health which could facilitate prompt treatment to reduce risk of relapse and improve clinical outcomes.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>It is currently not possible to predict risk of relapse at individual patient level following a first episode of psychosis (FEP). A more refined characterisation of clinical phenotype could enable better prediction of clinical outcomes than current diagnostic classification systems.

Electronic health records (EHRs) provide data on psychosis symptom profiles (positive; negative; disorganisation; mania; depression), risk factors and clinical outcomes. However, EHR data are typically only recorded during periods of contact with a clinician. Sensors built into smartphones continuously measure objective markers of activity and social interaction which correlate with changes in behaviour and mental state associated with relapse. Combining EHR and smartphone sensor data could help to better characterise clinical phenotype and predict outcomes in individual patients.

During my fellowship, I aim to investigate the relationship between EHR symptom profile data obtained using natural language processing (NLP) and clinical outcomes in people with FEP. I will collect passive smartphone activity and social interaction data in people with FEP and analyse their relationship with EHR symptom profile data. I will then develop and evaluate tools to predict outcomes at individual patient level by combining passive smartphone data and EHR symptom profile data using regression models and supervised machine learning.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-02-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-02-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>326857</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/S003118/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
