The ageing of populations is a global phenomenon and presents a new dynamic to the process and pattern of transfers. Its impact on transmissions of wealth and poverty between generations could be one of the key challenges of the 21st Century. This raises complex issues for individuals, families and government that are best explored through collaboration.&lt;br />&lt;br />The function of globalised markets is central to the unequal generation of wealth and assets across developed and developing nations. Whilst cultural, social, political and regulatory regimes provide the context which further promote or inhibit generational transfers. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://integratenet.st-andrews.ac.uk/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>International Network of Generational Transfers Research (INTEGRATE)&lt;/a> will bring together existing knowledge and understanding with a view to facilitating knowledge exchange, identifying gaps in understanding, generating ideas and themes to create new, research projects which address this international, indeed global, problem.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our proposal is ambitious in nature, and will take us into unknown territory. This approach whilst having some risks, does give rise to potentially greater impact than maintaining the status quo. Through developing new, multi-disciplinary, international connections, the network and potential future research, will be in a position to contribute to the diversity of social science impact, including: better informed public policy and decision making; different ways of thinking about the social and economic problems arising from the worldwide economic crisis, population ageing, growing inequalities; and the transmission of poverty and wealth across generations. INTEGRATE will draw on participants' established networks with a range of influential non-academic stakeholders and through these connections will draw in a wider group of beneficiaries from policy, user groups and commercial settings.

Beneficiaries of this work include international policy and regulatory bodies (for example the European Commission's Department of Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, UNDESA, WHO, UNRISD, ILO). Organisations and networks which promote the interests of older people (for example Age Platform Europe, AGEUK, HelpAge International) and younger people (for example UK's Intergenerational Foundation, and Youth for Europe) . More knowledge on intergeneration transfers and generation cooperation and conflicts is of key importance for policy makers at all levels of the government (including for example DFID, DWP, DCLG). Policy-makers would benefit from better knowledge of the role inter-generational transfers play in the spatial accumulation of wealth on the one hand, and the spatial concentration of poverty on the other. Such concerns address mechanisms operating on both a meso- and micro-level and would provide valuable local and national knowledge affecting issues ranging from urban planning through to fiscal policy. 

The future of welfare states and how ideas of welfare and fairness might change overtime must recognise the contribution of private wealth and strategies. Better understanding of the mechanisms through which intergenerational transfers affect the process of social stratification (and challenge ideals of meritocracy and equality of opportunity) could provide the basis for fairer and more efficient tax systems. It is a great challenge for policy makers to take into account the interest of different generations. But our aim is also to raise the profile of the implications of generational transfers in public debates. This is not just through producing evidence of the giving and receiving of resources, but importantly to give voice to those who may be caught in the middle (supporting older parents and adult children); those who do not have access to family resources; and those who do not have access to any resources. 

The network and future research will also have an impact in the commercial private sector. Developers and real estate brokers would benefit from better knowledge of the role the inter-generational transfers play in housing careers of younger and future generations. This understanding would feed into decisions of housing supply for potential future clients. More knowledge is also of key importance for the financial industry and their product innovations. New products may be necessary to facilitate new strategies of distributing/spreading wealth over different generations. Beneficiaries will also include organisations that represent key areas of industry (for example in respect of the transfer of housing wealth, the European Mortgage Federation and the UK's Council for Mortgage Lenders). 

The network may also have impact in the third sector. Charities and socially oriented NGO's would benefit from better knowledge of the role the inter-generational transfers (or lack of the inter-generational transfers) plays in development of social deprivation.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>25152</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/J019259/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:parents><gtr:parent><gtr:id>FDC62639-4757-43E3-8BDC-C1DBBE90A2B5</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>ES/J019259/1</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>25152.11</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2012-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2013-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:children><gtr:child rel="Transfer"><gtr:id>30331096-DF76-48ED-B094-7ADD45DEA180</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>ES/J019259/2</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>18848.43</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2014-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:children/></gtr:child></gtr:children></gtr:parent></gtr:parents></gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>B57EEFB7-602E-4F5D-92E4-A0C265266249</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Demography &amp; human geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>32A0976A-B577-4829-A940-9AB6B148F977</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Area &amp; Development Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>808111E3-5E04-4CEF-B080-565A81EFD6D0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Demography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
