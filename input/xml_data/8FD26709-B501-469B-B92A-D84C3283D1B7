This was especially the case in the Middle Ages when Christianity and the Church shaped both society and culture, and people of all social backgrounds shared at least some beliefs in common and took part in regular religious ceremonies and festivals. This research explores the reasons and consequences of the growth in religious behaviour in England during the period 1350 to 1560 by focusing on devotion to the holy name of Jesus.\n\nThe name 'Jesus' meant 'saviour' and was invoked for healing, protection and salvation. Throughout the early centuries of the Church Christian writers extolled its benefits, promoting affection and personal attachment to the name of Jesus through prayer, worship and meditation. By the thirteenth century these writings had gained sufficient momentum for reverence of the name of Jesus to be promoted by the papacy and for it to be celebrated in formal religious rituals including special Masses of the name of Jesus. Personal devotion to the name of Jesus was promoted among the general populace by preaching and by the fourteenth century what can be described as distinctive cults of the holy name had developed in different parts of Western Europe with large, socially diverse followings. These involved membership of fraternities dedicated to the holy name and the support of rituals in its honour, as well as more private forms of devotion such as personal prayer and meditation. This research focuses on how and why devotion to the name of Jesus developed a popular following in England from the late fourteenth century by applying approaches adopted from cognitive psychology that have hitherto largely been used by social anthropologists.\n\nIt does this by investigating in detail how personal and corporate devotion to the name of Jesus spread across four different geographic regions, namely Kent, Norfolk, Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire and by identifying the sorts of mental and communicative processes that were involved in its dissemination and how these might help to explain its growth. It looks for evidence of personal and household devotion to the holy name and more corporate affiliation in the form of fraternities and religious rituals in parish churches and cathedrals, and aims to identify what sorts of people promoted these practices and the kinds of individuals and social groups that adopted them. These included the clergy, whether bishops, parish priests, monks, nuns and friars, as well as ordinary people who did not belong to any religious order.\n\nIt uses a range of evidence including religious books containing services, prayers, hymns and theological tracts on the holy name, last wills that record support for devotion to the name of Jesus by individuals close to death, in the form of bequests for the celebration of Masses of the name of Jesus for example, and churchwardens' accounts that mention things like altars that were dedicated to the name of Jesus or the activities of Jesus fraternities.\n\nThe research is important because, by exploring the particular appeal of the name of Jesus in this historical period, it sheds light on the nature of religious belief and practice in the past and why certain religious ideas and practices gain popular followings. This has obvious contemporary relevance in a world where, despite Western secularization, religion continues to play a major role in society, culture and politics. The research is also important because of its potential to tells us about the ways religion was changing prior to the Reformation. This, in turn provides insights into the ways in which Roman Catholicism and ostensibly new Protestant forms of Christianity in the sixteenth century drew on ideas and traditions established in the later Middle Ages and how that medieval heritage went on to shape Western culture into the modern period.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>One of the objectives of this research is to increase public knowledge and understanding of popular culture in the past and its relevance to human behaviour and experience in the present. Due to the sorts of cultural phenomena it will describe, its public audiences are likely to have an interest in religion and the history of the Christian Church but also in social and cultural history as a whole. General interest in the history of religion in the pre-Reformation and Reformation periods is buoyant and is evidenced by the success of accessible scholarly works among non-academic audiences such as Eamon Duffy's 'The Stripping of the Altars'. The proposed monograph will therefore be accessible to a wide readership in order to engage with these audiences. The proposed article in a history magazine will also help to communicate the research findings to these wider audiences.\n\nThose groups that are most likely to benefit from this research are the Roman Catholic and Anglican Churches in England for which devotion to the name of Jesus forms an important part of their shared history and cultural heritage. This project will provide opportunities for the enrichment of religious traditions and practices through engagement with the past. There is potential to open avenues for productive conversations and collaborations with these groups through a number of activities and initiatives over the course of three years after the end of the fellowship (see 'Pathways to Impact').\n\nThe project's regional focus will identify particular parish and cathedral churches that played an important part in the dissemination of the cult of the holy name. This will create opportunities to communicate knowledge that is specific to these communities, and open the way for collaborations that will deepen understanding of the rich history of Christian practice in England. Initial approaches to selected churches, alerting them to the research, will be made within the timescale of the fellowship and the communication of knowledge arising from the research will take place within a year after the end of the fellowship as detailed in 'Pathways to Impact'. It is envisaged that specific collaborations will then arise as the findings of the research are made available to interested parishes and institutions.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>58503</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Groningen</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Netherlands, Kingdom of the</gtr:country><gtr:department>Research Centre for Historical Studies</gtr:department><gtr:description>COST Action IS 1301: New Communities of Interpretation: Contexts, Strategies and Processes of Religious Transformation in Late Medieval and Early Modern Europe</gtr:description><gtr:id>1FBC4C9F-5DA1-4475-821A-D2B46B049D84</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None as yet but see above for publications in progress.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d0360f8ad3d5.99210811-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>I am a member of the COST Action and of Working Group 1 within it.

I attended the plenary meeting of the COST Action in Groningen 3-5 Nov 2016 at which 'Working Group 1' planned a special issue in the journal 'Textual Practice' on the subject of 'Dialogic' in late medieval religious writing to be submitted Sept. 2018 for publication in 2019. I am submitting a paper on 'Dialogic in writings on the Holy Name in England' for inclusion in the special issue.

I will contribute to a Graduate Student Training School sponsored by the COST Action entitled 'Passionate Devotions: Emotions in religious texts, images and music in late medieval and early modern Europe' in Muenster, 26-28 April 2017. I am one of four expert speakers who will run focused sessions arising directly from their own research with a small group of selected graduate research students working in relevant fields. I will run a session entitled 'Routinized ecstasy?: emotional arousal in the late medieval English cult of the Holy Name of Jesus'.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>I have developed a much greater understanding of how devotion to the name of Jesus developed in theological and devotional writing from the church fathers up to the fifteenth century. Statements on the meanings of the name of Jesus and on its moral and spiritual merits are actually rather limited before the 14th century and relatively stable. However, in England, writing on the Holy Name became more ecstatic at the same time as the development of preaching of the devotion that focused more on its moral and protective benefits. This latter campaign had papal backing which resulted in bowing at the name of Jesus in church services being made compulsory in the late 13th century. There is evidence that this caused some controversy among the monastic orders at this time, perhaps because there was some disquiet about Holy Name enthusiasm. The contribution to the devotion in England of the 14th-century English mystic Richard Rolle was profound. Not only did he raise the importance of contemplation on the name of Jesus as a mystical and devotional technique but he disseminated the devotion to a much more socially diverse audience. One of my key findings is that Rolle did not formulate a clearly defined set of Holy Name practices and so how a devotee practiced Holy Name contemplation by the late 14th century was left open to interpretation. This paved the way for widely different practices and understandings and, in some cases, beliefs and practices that were condemned as, at best, unhelpful and, at worst heterodox and dangerous. These findings question the whole notion that there was a coherent or commonly understood 'cult of the Holy Name' in late medieval England apart from its development in the liturgy from c. 1390. This is complicated further by my discovery that Lollard versions of some of Rolle's writings show a keen interest in the Holy Name. Therefore the 'orthodox' credentials of Holy Name devotion are further undermined.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings not only shed new light on the nature of pre-Reformation popular religion but on the reasons for humanity's ongoing susceptibility to powerful religious representations in the form of enthusiastic and fundamentalist religious movements and cults. By applying cognitive psychology to the historical evidence the research opens up the ways in which religious representations were remembered and transmitted and how those very processes help to explain their power.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>7AC67521-86A9-4777-B812-C921BBB94694</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545cf4f271f871.13437672</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I022015/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>950E3601-19AF-48B8-9030-FB18B0E0FB1A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medieval Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>2C2F94EA-88C5-492D-B73E-AC67963698EA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Religious History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
