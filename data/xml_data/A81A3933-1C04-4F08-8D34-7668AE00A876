Following devolution the comparisons between the educational achievements of children in Wales and England have continued. 



The apparent 'gap' in GCSE achievement between Wales and England, recent PISA international comparisons and political differences between the governments of Wales and England have fueled what can be described as a crisis account, particularly within the media and among policy-makers, about the state of the education system in Wales.



In challenging this dominant crisis account, this presentation examines the educational development of children in the first seven years of their lives. It provides evidence of the differences of growing up in different countries in the UK and being schooled in different education systems after controlling for a range of background factors such as the conditions children are born in to. 



In the presentation it will also be argued that by looking at social inequalities as the children grow up it is possible to determine whether some systems appear to exacerbate or reduce educational inequalities in the first few years of life.

A record of this analysis and the presentation is made by Leighton Andews (AM) (the Minister for Education and Skills at the time) in his book 'Ministering to Education' (2014, Parthian Books).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-9231402649.759692a9accc4</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/parliamentarians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Educational Attainment and Poverty</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>000E5331-53E0-4D97-926E-F397AC38DB7D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This presentation examines the relationship between poverty and educational attainment using data and analysis from the Millennium Cohort Study. In particular it outlines the systematic differences between children living in poverty and children not living in poverty on their early years development. It also considers some of the latest analysis on the role of the family and home learning environment on the educational development of children before discussing what role schools and local authorities can have in intervening in the first few years of compulsory education. I was invited to present research using the MCS to a subgroup of elected Councillors from the Cardiff Council Children and Young People Scrutiny Committee. This subgroup were undertaking a review of educational attainment and poverty for the main Scrutiny Committee.

First, it has significantly raised the profile of the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) in Wales. This has been achieved in two main ways: (a) by encouraging and supporting its use and analysis in a variety of disciplinary contexts (education, social policy, sociology, geography and policy evaluation) and for different kinds of researchers (academic, government and third sector communities); and (b) through widespread dissemination within Wales of the findings by the Fellow, to national media, academic audiences, politicians, Welsh Government policy-makers and third sector stakeholders. 



Second, it has generated important research findings. These include the use of the MCS to make 'home international' comparisons of the different UK education systems on children up to age seven. This highlighted the relative advantage of living in England compared to living in other countries of the UK, particularly in terms of reducing socio-economic inequalities and the striking advantage of London. MCS was also used to evaluate a major education policy in Wales, the Foundation Phase - a new curriculum and pedagogy for 3-7 year olds. This demonstrated, surprisingly, a relative disadvantage for children attending a Foundation Phase pilot school compared to schools still delivering the previous Key Stage 1 National Curriculum. Another key set of findings from the Fellowship relate to the validity, appropriateness and limitations of using eligibility for free school meals as the socio-economic proxy in analyses of educational administrative data. Finally, the Fellowship has been used to demonstrate the complexity and challenge of attempting to understand the role of socio-economic disadvantage on early years development, and how difficult it is, therefore, to identify the factors that may explain how some children 'succeed against the odds' that policy-makers, in particular, often desire.



Third, the Fellowship has allowed me to substantially develop my own quantitative skills and to make a number of important methodological contributions to the analysis of the MCS and longitudinal data generally. This includes: developing analytical approaches in the use of the MCS for evaluative research of education policies that have to contend with the complex and largely hierarchical nature of the educational process; analytical approaches for comparative analyses, including the use of propensity score matching and multi-level modelling with the MCS; and to highlight the potential of visualisation in presenting dynamic longitudinal analyses ( collaborating with Longview -an organisation promoting longitudinal study). .Another contribution to CLS resources was the help I was able to give over linking MCS to Welsh school records.



Finally, the Fellowship allowed me to obtain substantial funding for further longitudinal research, including follow-on analysis of the MCS: WISERDEducation a three-year multi-cohort longitudinal study of children in Wales; an ESRC Secondary Data Analysis Initiative project undertaking longitudinal analysis of linked administrative datasets; the WISERD Civil Society ESRC Centre which includes a project studying intergenerational transmission using Understanding Society; and currently preparing an ESRC proposal to undertake qualitative fieldwork with a key group of MCS cohort children who are 'succeeding against the odds'.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The research and findings from this Fellowship have already been utilised by many non-academic users, particularly in government policy. This includes use of the research findings in the first report of the UK Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission - an advisory non-departmental body of the Department of Education in the UK Government. I was also invited to present my research by the then Minster for Education in the Welsh Government, Leighton Andrews AM, to his Policy Board. I was also asked to present to a sub-group of the Cardiff Council Young People and Scrutiny Committee that was investigating the impact of poverty on educational attainment (some of my findings were later reported in their final report to the full Committee). Further research was presented at an ESRC knowledge exchange event jointly organised by WISERD and the Welsh Government on early years development. Some of these findings were later included in the Welsh Government's (2013) Early Years and Childcare Plan. I am also due to draw upon research from this Fellowship in work for the Public Policy Institute for Wales. This was, launched in January 2014 to improve the effectiveness of policy-making and delivery in Wales, and across the UK, by supporting the flow of evidence between research, policy and practice. One of its initial work packages is to review evidence relating to the impact of poverty on educational attainment in Wales. Throughout this Fellowship I have worked closely with three organisations:



1. The Wales Institute for Social &amp;amp; Economic Research, Data &amp;amp; Methods (WISERD) - a collaboration of five universities in Wales, including Cardiff University, drawing together researchers from a wide range of social science disciplines. I am now the Cardiff Co-Director for WISERD and this national research institute has afforded me the opportunity to work with many other social scientists in collaboration or in supporting the wider use of the MCS and large-scale longitudinal data more generally.



2. The Centre for Longitudinal Studies (CLS) at the Institute of Education, University of London - this is the home of the MCS and where my mentor, Professor Heather Joshi, is based. I was given the status of Visiting Research Associate at the CLS (giving me desk space and access to IoE libraries) and visited the Centre regularly during the Fellowship to meet with my mentor, Centre staff and the Director of Longview.



3. The Welsh Government and specifically the Knowledge and Analytical Services division, home to Government Social Researchers at the Welsh Government.
