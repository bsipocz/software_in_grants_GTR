Research shows that ensemble performance participation raises self-confidence in children and adults. However ensemble music-making grinds to a halt when non-music readers participate - with the result that they feel excluded. Can a system be developed which integrates them? 

A vast library of ensemble music exists in infinite archive form: http://imslp.org/ (International Music Score Library Project - 295,000 scores at 21/11/14). This offers everyone the chance to play many culturally valued pieces of ensemble and orchestral music because parts are typically available alongside scores. However these files are often scans of 19th century and 20th century editions, and therefore static, and of variable quality. Could critical and curatorial approaches, including careful preparation of files in a more suitable format (e.g. MIDI) drive a networked music notation system suitable for a wide range of users? And thereby interface between the infinite library resource of the online music score library project, and the real-world possibility of ensemble performance for newcomers to participatory music, facilitated by networking technology?

Libraries such as imslp.org increasingly represent to the public the body of historical and contemporary notated music available to live music ensembles. New beneficiaries of ensemble music through active computer networking in live ensemble performance contexts could be many and multiple, ranging from school children to adult amateurs to people engaging in music therapeutic treatments or recovering from an experience of isolation. On our advisory group we will have representatives from Education (the head of Brighton &amp;amp; Hove Music Service), Health (the research lead from Intensive Care Medicine Research, Brighton and Hove), Cultural organisations (the head of the Brighton Science Festival) and Arts Policy (the learning producer from the Arts Council funded organisation Sound and Music). In addition we will have academic experts in public engagement and digital material culture.

In the first instance we will create a system which dynamically updates to indicate current position in the score. This could be conductor-led (with a 'smart baton' counting beats and so updating position in score) or computer controlled, in the case that a conductor was not available. The scores for orchestral members would be networked and either digitally presented and highlighted on a tablet, or paper scores augmented with digitally controlled LEDs. Once we have a system which can synchronise networked information, then we will also be interested in how this could support other forms of notation for ensemble performance.

During the pilot, we will consider questions about the legibility of tablet displays; the flexibility and future-proof status of the underpinning software; and possible approaches to music notation digital networking that do not involve screens. We will explore how effective technologies can be in bringing mixed ability musicians and complete beginners together. 

This work may have exciting implications for non-classical ensembles where synchronised notations could be productive in group work and musical forms requiring coordination hand in hand with creative flexibility in tempos and/or transpositions (e.g. electric guitar ensembles, concert bands, laptop orchestras). 

Through this practice project, using Arts and Humanities critical and collaborative approaches, the project team and the advisory group will meet regularly to debate, scope and prepare the ground for a larger project on the future relationship between networked ensemble performance and online infinite archives of notated music, such as imslp.org, by creating a prototype with school children as initial subjects and then publicly debating its potential wider applications with a range of interested parties.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Through practice-led research, collaborative critical enquiry and innovation using networking technology this pilot will critically mediate the gap between fixed musical notation and the flexibility needed in real-life ensemble performance, especially in mixed ability settings. The model developed will add value and further creative possibilities to existing work (for example the BBC's 'Ten Pieces' project and associated website resources http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01vs08w). Through its work and discussions with its advisory group, the project will scope a bigger project on the question of public online archives of musicals scores and their relationship to future networked ensembles and orchestras - it thus has the longer-term potential to reach and influence programming policies as well as broad arts and arts education policies. We welcome the presence of the London Symphony Orchestra's Head of Orchestral Artistry on our advisory group.

Which groups will benefit from the pilot project?

- Artists interested in networking technology and its potential transformation of ensemble music of all kinds
- Bands interested in developing new ways of structuring and coordinating their compositions and performances
- Teachers and education professionals interested in using networking technology in order to deliver ensemble performance requirements of the national curriculum in more engaging and effective ways
- Health professionals and patients interested in innovative therapies involving ensemble performance and networking technology
- Music hubs interested in reaching out further to enable young people from disadvantaged backgrounds to experience participation in ensemble music, even though they may lack instrumental training
- Community ensembles and orchestras who bring together mixed ability groups in order to perform the music of today and historical ensemble and orchestral music
- Professional ensembles and orchestras interested in approaches to engaging new audiences through the direct experience of participation
- The general public through enhanced understanding of innovation through critical approaches to technology in relation to both traditional and contemporary musical practices

How will they benefit?

- Artists will be able to share in and understand the findings and innovations of the work through the public events and the website
- Bands (initially at Brighton Institute of Modern Music) will be offered the chance to experiment with the prototype developed after the test as part of the collaborative public demonstration; Mark Irwin, Assistant Principal, BIMM, has expressed willingness to be involved
- Teachers, education professionals and Music Hubs will be drawn in through (a) direct participation and (b) sharing of the project via networks of the Head of Brighton and Hove Music Service, who is on the advisory board
- Health professionals and patients will gain access to the project through the networks of the Head of Intensive Care Medicine Research who is on the advisory board
- Community ensembles will benefit through the participation on the Advisory Board of Dr Adam Swayne, director of Contemporary Music for All, Sussex, who will also be involved in public events post-testing period
- Professional orchestras will learn of this work and the possibilities of deployment via the presence of the Head of Orchestral Artistry from the London Symphony Orchestra on the advisory board
- The general public attending the Brighton Science Festival, will learn of this project through the Festival's networks and marketing, and also through Music Of Our Time's networks; there is a great deal of public and press interest in the nature and culture of live musical practices and so the public roundtable and demonstration on networking technology and the experience of ensemble performance will attract strong attention, which is why the Festival has already committed to programming it in February 2016.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>39385</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Written for The New Music Players and Orchestra of Sound and Light for concerts in London and Sussex, with funding support from The RVW Trust and Arts Council England.

Alice in Wonderland is a score in three main sections, inspired by a short film of the same name from 1903 by Hepworth and Stow. The film stars May Clark as Alice. In 2010 the BFI restored and released the remaining fragments of the film. It lasts approximately 9'30&amp;quot;.

The film is fascinating because it is a very early attempt to transfer an extended children's novel to the screen. As is usual in the early days of cinema, it presents a series of vignettes or scenes from a well-known story. It is also very engaging because it uses special effects and trick photography to create the atmosphere of a dream world of fantasies and anxieties.

I wanted to work with an early film that would capture the interest of non-specialist audiences including school children and to create a score that could enable them to participate musically.

The core ensemble of flute, clarinet, piano, violin and cello establishes the pulse and the main pitch centres. Throughout the first section the pulse is clear and the pitch centre is C. In the second section, there is a more complex approach to rhythm, but throughout the piano and the cello provide the main pulse and rhythm, and the chords will always work with the note E. In the third section, the ideas of the first section are explored and developed.</gtr:description><gtr:id>21872161-4EC6-4877-B228-A0ACA50DCC49</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Performed with a combined ensemble of classical musicians and a rock band using iPads technology:

We've also had a very positive response from other sessions outside the specific field trial work, with musicians (pro and amateur) saying they would use the system if it was available.

As specified in the grant application, the PI arranged compositions for the sessions with the primary school orchestra, including Grieg In the Hall of the Mountain King, and Hughes Song for Francesca. Music XML files are parsed by the system for use in live ensemble performance.

In addition the system has been successfully tried in one off sessions at BIMM and East Sussex Academy of Music, where its potential for development was also recognised. Here is a list of performances which have so far made use of the system:

Bringing together a University of Sussex team from Music, Digital Humanities and Psychology, we explored curation of repertoire (new and old) in a digital ensemble setting, developing new software and hardware to explore this theme successfully, and evaluating it through both interviews and questionnaires. The process was collaborative and positive: we devised new methods to explore repertoires and the performance of ensemble music using technology, and we evaluated how digital technology can add value to the experience and also cast light on the nature of musical ensemble performance itself.

We produced two papers to disseminate our research to academic audiences:
Eldridge, A, Kiefer, C, Hughes, E (2016) Designing Dynamic Networked Scores to Enhance the Experience of Ensemble Music Making. Proceedings of International Conference on Technologies for Music Notation (TENOR)
Hanrahan, F., Hughes, E., Banerjee, R., Kiefer, C., Eldridge, A. (2017) Networking technologies and children's experience of ensemble music making. Submitted to International Journal of Music Education and under consideration.

These papers reported on (1) the technical achievements and process of the project, including the way development and design were guided by the users; and (2) statistical evaluation of children's enjoyment of orchestra facilitated by technology, and the link to positive overall experiences of being able to contribute to, and feel like an important part of, orchestra.

We also gathered a large body of media (interviews, research notes, videos, audio recordings) in our sessions, and ran qualitative analyses on these materials.


Significant achievements from the award:

Consulting
Our research project began with an extended consultation with academics, teachers, and a wide range of potentially interested users.

We did this by:
? observing a primary school orchestra over a period of five weeks and talking to their teacher
? talking with teachers in primary, secondary, sixth-form, FE and HE
? convening an advisory group comprising local and national cultural and arts leaders and practitioners
? presenting our ideas and plans in two academic research seminars
? running two workshops with (a) school children and (b) university music students to test prototypes and gain feedback

Building a repertoire
Eventually we hope to have a system that can read music and render it swiftly in a wireless setting using the most powerful combinations of traditional and modern notation with digital technology to enable ensemble performance. For now, as we hand-build the code underpinning our system, we are in parallel building a repertoire for our initial user group (a primary school orchestra). 

We are doing this by:
? curating and arranging pieces for the system, including Grieg's In the Hall of the Mountain King, inspired by the BBC's Ten Pieces
? composing new pieces suited to our primary school orchestra user group that feature simple harmonies and rhythms but definite polyphony so that the benefits of the system can be observed
? developing and refining approaches to displaying parts according to ability (e.g. 'easy cello', 'flute', and in due course graphic notation for non-readers)

Evaluation
Working with Robin Banerjee and Fidelma Hanrahan from School of Psychology, a plan for evaluating the experience of ensemble performance in our target user group was devised. 
Aims. This research tested whether the introduction of networked tablets enhanced the experience of ensemble music making by reducing practical problems associated with ensemble music playing for early stage musicians (e.g. getting lost in the music) thereby leading to better engagement the music. By reducing practical problems, thereby interrupting the downward spiral of frustration and lack of confidence in playing, we expected that instead of low levels of enjoyment of ensemble music playing, feelings of enjoyment and identification with the orchestra will be enhanced.
Participants. Participants taking part in the quasi-experimental test phases in this study were existing participants of Southover Primary School orchestra, aged 9 to 11 years - approximately 27 pupils in total. 
Methods. A quasi-experimental approach using survey measures at pre, during and post time points was used to measure pupils' experience of ensemble music playing and the impact of the introduction of technology. Questions tapped into pupils' enjoyment of, sense of belonging to, and engagement in, orchestra. In addition, an in-depth interview with the music teacher/orchestra conductor, and a focus group with a sample of young orchestra players ran in order to capture their perspective on the experience of ensemble music playing and what difference, if any, the introduction of networked tablets has had on pupil engagement in orchestra. 

Extent to which objectives met:
Objectives listed in AHRC application were met.
The only variation on this is we are holding back on full release of code as open source in order to apply for time to extend this through further follow-on impact funding, including a future App store release which could have very significant international impacts.

How might the findings be taken forward and by whom:
In the future we're interested in exploring the system's impacts in a wide range of settings, including non-classical, professional, broader community, and therapeutic.

We think this system may soon contribute to bridging gaps between acoustic and electric forms of ensemble performance.

We're working with colleagues in Psychology in order to explore how the benefits of technology may be effectively evaluated in this type of project, especially on a larger scale.

Information on our project is fully accessible at the project's website: http://netem.org.uk/</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We are very excited about the potential to build on this work. Having focused deliberately on a tightly-knit timetable and target group, we think that feedback points to very strong potential in terms of the benefits of our research to existing and future user groups. For example, although not formally part of our study, we shared the system with students with limited music literacy at Brighton Institute of Modern Music in a specially convened workshop. These students gave very positive feedback on how the system facilitated their performance both technically and expressively; the sense of security provided by the system interestingly led to higher opportunities for flexible and creative expression. Similarly we shared the results with COMA Sussex at the Brighton Science Festival and via numerous public events (please refer to web site). Here we had a range of feedback but striking comments from novice players included 'I enjoyed feeling part of something bigger' and 'it gave me a sense of belonging to something special'. We think we can build on this towards a larger scale, more sustained study, with a view to examining the contribution networking technology can make to bridging aesthetic gaps, and in community, health and well-being settings.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>F6FDA8E1-9197-452A-838F-5A809F21FD9A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56cccb53299e52.21584786</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://netem.org.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/M010120/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
