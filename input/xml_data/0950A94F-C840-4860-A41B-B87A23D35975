The muscles themselves are normal but the part of the brain damaged by stroke cannot make clear signals to tell them what to do. Complicated, coordinated tasks such as swallowing and coughing can be particularly difficult. The dangerous combination of impaired swallow and ineffective cough means that stroke patients often inhale food into the lungs and cannot clear it. Life-threatening chest infections may result; nearly 30,000 UK stroke patients annually die in this way. Dr Ward, a specialist chest doctor, will study stroke patients to find how signals from the brain to the abdominal muscles (needed to create a forceful cough) have been affected. She will trial simple methods of retraining stroke patients to cough. It is thought that parts of the brain undamaged by stroke can be encouraged take over the job of controlling cough. This change in roles for healthy parts of the brain is called cortical plasticity and it is an important means by which stroke patients recover. Improved cough is very likely to reduce stroke deaths.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Background
Stroke is the third most common cause of mortality in the UK, accounting for 60,000 deaths annually. Nearly half the deaths are caused by pneumonia, which is a common complication of poor swallow and aspiration (where food or liquids are inhaled into the lungs) after stroke. Effective cough reduces the likelihood of pneumonia but is in itself commonly impaired. 
Cough requires co-ordinated activation of the abdominal muscles to generate forced expiratory airflow. Our own research has shown that acute stroke patients with middle cerebral artery territory infarcts have impaired voluntary and induced (reflex) cough despite preservation of abdominal (expiratory) muscle strength. It is likely that lack of cortical co-ordination is responsible for the poor cough function immediately post-stroke. 

Aims
 To gain understanding of cortical control of the abdominal muscles after stroke
 To find the best method of facilitating abdominal muscle activation; 
 and ultimately
 To improve cough airflow rates and expired volumes in acute stroke patients 

Design and Methods
Part 1
We will use transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to investigate the corticospinal pathways to the abdominal muscles in well-characterised stroke patients and age and sex-matched controls. The optimal method of obtaining motor evoked potential (MEP) signals from the bilateral abdominal muscles will be determined.
Part 2
We will study normal subjects to find the best method of facilitating abdominal muscle activation. The effectiveness of interventions will be assessed using TMS. 
Part 3
We will use the best facilitation protocol in stroke patients. The patients will have TMS and cough tests before and after the intervention. We will look for improvement in neurophysiological (MEP) parameters and most importantly in cough airflow rates and expired volumes.

Scientific and Medical Opportunities:
The research described will take specialised research techniques and use them in a clinical therapeutic scenario. Analogous work has been performed in stroke patients with dysphagia where cortical reorganisation was associated with improved swallow. We hypothesise that improvement in cough after stroke may be brought about by facilitating activation of abdominal muscles, either via ipsilateral corticospinal pathways or by inducing cortical plasticity in areas involved in cough in the undamaged cerebral hemisphere.

This research will increase understanding of the complex pathophysiology behind a common, often fatal illness. It has the potential to provide information required to set up a future clinical trial of simple non-drug treatment to improve cough and reduce deaths amongst stroke patients.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>218167</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D782BE0D-A0CC-4BFD-ACEC-ECEE43589AC6</gtr:id><gtr:title>Poor cough flow in acute stroke patients is associated with reduced functional residual capacity and low cough inspired volume.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>BMJ open respiratory research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8955affec8ac52249fdac8df1b237eb1"><gtr:id>8955affec8ac52249fdac8df1b237eb1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ward K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2052-4439</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a79b61c235ed2.70708075</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8F43B5DF-858F-4845-9E93-D02DC5BA6D97</gtr:id><gtr:title>Acute ischaemic hemispheric stroke is associated with impairment of reflex in addition to voluntary cough.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The European respiratory journal</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/8955affec8ac52249fdac8df1b237eb1"><gtr:id>8955affec8ac52249fdac8df1b237eb1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ward K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0903-1936</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>54633b5d6e3f13.35896661</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E9FDE70B-30E3-4C09-A937-41A251DCD5B5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Transcranial magnetic stimulation study of expiratory muscle weakness in acute ischemic stroke.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Neurology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/213c87c8cf9fc884df565d6e4c7fc064"><gtr:id>213c87c8cf9fc884df565d6e4c7fc064</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Harraf F</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2008-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0028-3878</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>54633c1f4656b4.15783022</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">G0701381</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>D81A471F-556F-4570-BF6A-5D197943223C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Oral and Gastrointestinal</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>A77DAE3A-499B-4F46-971D-6C82F51F9C2E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>80</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Stroke</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>93E3E424-8678-4BDD-9675-2EA16B3EFEA4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>5.3  Medical devices</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
