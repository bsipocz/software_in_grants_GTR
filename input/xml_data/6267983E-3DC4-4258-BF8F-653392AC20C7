This demand is evidenced at national, regional and local levels as well as through the commitment of the ~30 organisations supporting the Centre.The Vision for Systems is to be recognised as a world leading 'Centre for Systems Engineering Research' by 2012, through multidisciplinary collaboration and networking, with industry and collaborating universities.The IDC will be delivered with the active participation of our Strategic Advisory Board, representing all key stakeholders and with a majority of industrial members. This stakeholder led approach is a key and underpinning element of our engineering research, teaching and knowledge exchange strategy. The Centre is a true partnership with the University of Bath, for which an Institutional Agreement is in place.Development of Systems Engineering research and teaching is a strategic priority at both Universities. Synergy exists between the development of the Centre and development of more fundamental systems research, which is attracting academics of exceptionally strong international standing. This is contributing to the growing reputation and international profile of the Centre itself; evidence by:- involvement of companies who have global choice for their research- rapidly accelerating rate of applications for EngD projects- outstanding quality of the REs we are attracting.The research and training environment is designed using 'systems thinking' principles to deliver the overall purpose of our IDC process which is to develop tomorrows leaders in the heart of UK Industry and deliver industrially relevant research and commercially successful innovation. The University has created a world-class physical teaching and networking environment and requires rigorous quality assurance of process. The facilities will be extended to meet the sustained increase in capacity required for the IDC.A flexible but integrated programme of teaching is initiated with an induction course that sets expectations and promotes networking and an ethos of 'learning together'. Units in Systems Engineering are aimed at developing 'can do' confidence. Teaching also includes business management and units in support of research domain learning. All mandatory teaching is via week long units, designed to encourage reflection into industrial experience and independent learning. A feature of our approach is the enthusiastic involvement of Systems practitioners.Capitalising on the recent appointment of Bristol as National Coordinating Centre for Public Engagement, we intend to develop an additional unit in Public Engagement.An integrated team management process is already in place, led by Prof Patrick Godfrey. With the continued expansion of RE numbers, it will be expanded to include a Centre Manager and 4 more fte academic Systems staff.To be sustainable we need to increase the growing number of Employed EngDs in Systems. The substantially larger up front investment is restraining commitment to employed EngDs. From October 2008 we will be offering a 2-year part-time MRes in Systems, which can be traded in on completion of a 3-year full time EngD. This reduces the investment risk for employers substantially.This proposal also offers Prof Patrick Godfrey, the current EngD Centre and proposed IDC Director, as an Industrial Doctorate Advocate.Building on the enthusiasm of industry; engagement of REs, practitioners and academics; the commitment of EPSRC and both Universities; together with the external and internal profile and sense of purpose that being an IDC creates; will enable us to deliver our Vision for Systems and justify the investment of all concerned.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>4956494</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/G037353/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
