A UK-African Countries Network.

The proposed network, Examining Gender in Higher Education (EGHE), draws together academics and activists to share and build knowledge and expertise on key areas of concern in gender and higher education (HE) comparatively across a range of African countries as well as the UK; and to build the foundations for sustained research that will address key issues of pressing concern in the field. One key area of concern has already been identified: participation and success of women students in STEM subjects. This is a crucial focus area in relation to the goals of gender equality and social justice, and directly supports key priorities of network member countries in terms of economic and infrastructural development.

Scoping work will be undertaken in this focus area and also more broadly on issues related to gender and higher education in member countries as part of the EGHE network's activities, in order to produce policy briefings and to identify and develop further key areas for future collaboration (including a joint research bid). The network involves a collaborative partnership between academic colleagues with interdisciplinary expertise based in Rwanda, Uganda, and The Gambia; and at the University of Glasgow, UK, where the administration of the network will be undertaken. Finally the network will benefit from partnership with a prominent pan-African NGO working on issues relating to gender and education, with a key identified focus on STEM: the Forum for African Women Educationalists (FAWE). 

Network Aims 

Overall aim: To bring together academics with expertise and interests in gender and HE, and gender and STEM in the UK and in a range of African countries to benefit from mutual knowledge exchange.

Sub-aims:

To collaborate on activities that will expand/exchange knowledge on current issues of concern affecting women's participation and success at HE (as students/graduates and/or academic staff) in the countries involved (looking at issues in individual countries and also comparatively across countries)

To specifically look at the issue of women's participation in, experiences of, and success at a range of STEM subjects in the participating countries (again with national and comparative foci)

To encourage cross- and interdisciplinary collaborations (notably between educationalists, sociologists and STEM academics)

To develop the research capacity of ECRs in all participating countries 

To provide strong research links that will form the basis for future collaborative research projects on these themes


Network Activities

The network will create impact in relation to policy and practice within and outside HE institutions, by engaging with policymakers, practitioners, and other stakeholders through a range of activities including two Scoping Exercises mapping the current literature and key issues in members' national contexts (one on the topic of Gender and STEM in HE and one identifying further areas of key concern). The findings of these exercises will be developed into accessible policy briefings, translated into French, which will be disseminated at a number of academic and stakeholder events including FAWE's triennial general meeting in Nairobi. Further network activities include an accessible website/social media presence; the production of a short film for the website; and academic outputs including a peer-reviewed journal paper and a collaborative research grant proposal.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The network involves a full partnership between academics in the Global North and South and non-academic 'users' of research, through the involvement of the Forum for African Women Educationalists (FAWE). FAWE is a pan-African non-governmental organisation (NGO) working in 33 countries. An influential organisation, FAWE members include ministers and deputy ministers of Education and other policymakers across a range of African countries; educationalists working in all sectors of education (including senior university officials); as well as independent researchers and activists in all areas of gender and education.
FAWE have been involved in the design of the network proposal and Director Hendrina Doroba is a research partner. FAWE will be fully involved in dissemination activities, most centrally in relation to hosting a network event at FAWE's triennial general meeting in Nairobi in 2017. FAWE members will also be integrally involved in the network's plans to develop policy briefings based on the network's two scoping exercises, and will contribute to other outputs such as academic papers and publicly accessible material for the network's website. Moreover, FAWE members will be involved in the design of future bids for research funding that are developed by network members.
A wide variety of educational 'user' groups and policy makers in relevant areas of gender and education, and gender and STEM, will be in attendance at FAWE's triennial general meeting in Nairobi and will be invited to the network event, as well as presented with interim findings of the scoping exercises. This will include: educational practitioners working directly with students in both compulsory and higher education and concerned with gender issues, including the participation and success of girls/women in STEM subjects; educational policymakers involved in relevant areas of education, STEM, gender and social justice, and activist NGOs and networks of practitioners/policymakers. These will include the African Network Campaign on Education for All (ANCEFFA); the Educational Research Network for West and Central Africa (ENWARCA); The African Union's Human Resources Science and Technology (HRST); the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS); the Global e-Schools and Communities Initiative (GESCI). Finally the network's audience will likely include invited members from UNESCO's ICBA and private foundations such as Price WaterHouse Coopers and NCC Education (in relation to their initiatives concerning the Gender Gap in IT); MasterCard's scholarship program; and the Varkey Foundation. 
In order to be of direct benefit to policy makers, practitioners and other 'stakeholders' in the areas of gender, higher education, and STEM, the two policy briefings (based on the scoping exercises) will be designed to be publicly accessible and with jargon-free language, identifying issues of clear relevance to policy-makers' concerns in these areas. They will be translated into French in order to reach a broader range of stakeholders across the African continent. Additionally, the network's website will also be designed to be as accessible as possible to a policymaker/stakeholder audience, and act as an information portal for knowledge relevant and useful for this audience.
Finally the website will benefit from associated social media usage (eg twitter) and the production of accessible materials such as a short film showcasing the work of the network, designed to appeal to a range of non-academic as well as academic stakeholders. This will include student usergroups, and we will be drawing on the expertise of the University of Glasgow's women engineering students' group, FemEng, in an advisory capacity. FemEng are an active student-led body who have recently undertaken a visit to Rwanda to promote the discipline to girls of school age in the country, and have made effective use of social media in relation to the visit (see https://femengrwanda.wordpress.com).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-01-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>82019</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/P007228/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D2DE952A-D3A4-42AA-B3D0-37E979EBA723</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology of Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>D640D1B8-B141-4DFC-BCD3-CEADD848A918</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>GCRF</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
