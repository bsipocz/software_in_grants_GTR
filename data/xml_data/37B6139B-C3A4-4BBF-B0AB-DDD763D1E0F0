A large proportion of urban development in different regions of the world is taking place in mega-urban projects, such as new cities, satellite cities, or large new suburbs within existing cities. These developments are building the future city. They are important sites of experimentation in new ways of developing and governing the city as they often stretch across multiple jurisdictions and can take decades to bring to fruition. We specifically explore innovations in: how governments are seeking to manage the tensions between social inclusion and achieving development at scale under resource constraints; how communities are coming together across different neighbourhoods to support one another in the face of the huge changes these developments bring to their environs, including pressures for their displacement; and how developers are playing a growing role in governance. In addition, transnational connections are prolific in large scale urban developments where investors, developers, governments and communities are closely linked in to ideas, policies and practices from other contexts. We will consider how social innovations in all of our case studies are shaped by these wider, often shared, processes. 
Our core research question addresses concerns over whether this trend towards at-scale urban transformation emphasizes efficient delivery and market-driven financing of infrastructure over public participation in shaping city futures; or whether such large scale controversial developments might in fact be opening up a political space for new forms of governance. Based on in-depth case studies of three large scale developments in different contexts - the Mayoral Development Corporation in Old Oak Park Royal in London; a new suburb, Lingang, in Shanghai; and the ambitious Mayoral project to stitch together segregated Johannesburg through the &amp;quot;Corridors of Freedom&amp;quot; - we compare ways in which the governance of cities is changing. 
The three projects we have selected to study share similar challenges in terms of financing developments through enhancing land values, designing liveable and sustainable new urban areas, and fostering spatial planning models which integrate the new developments into the wider metropolitan region. In addition, the developments are linked in to shared international policy and development networks. Thus we feel it is productive to compare the range of different kinds of governance outcomes generated by large scale developments across these different planning and development contexts. Our cases consider different models of urban development: state-led new town construction in China, property-led planning-gain development in the UK, and the developmental models balancing service delivery with economic growth agendas in South Africa. This gives the research a very innovative academic component, as it is not common to compare development experiences in cities in different regions of the world; doing so means we can speak to the diversity of urban experiences across the globe, which are strongly influencing each other. Contrasting the declining scope for public participation in planning in the UK with the now well-established democratic urban planning process in South Africa, and emerging land markets, property rights awareness and concerns to generate vibrant urban communities in China expands our perspective of urban transformation to its full spectrum.

A distinctive feature of the research is that it has strong policy relevance. The research design creates a framework with a high potential for wider impact, including a dedicated strand of action research to co-produce knowledge with local residents and business groups, and a targeted engagement with planners and policy makers to enable direct learning across the three cases in relation to models of development finance and management.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project will support learning about innovations in relation to the shared governance challenges of large scale urban developments in three contexts (London, Shanghai, Johannesburg). These include: achieving sustainable and inclusive urban development through property-based models of financing; achieving metropolitan spatial integration; enabling community engagement at such a scale and over the long duration of these developments. For example, Shanghai planners have concerns with spatial integration, a large proportion of workers commute from the central city; government are working on a new vision of self-contained cities within the metropolis, and are eager to learn from other cases. Meeting development needs through property based development is of concern in Johannesburg, and the limits of London's current property development model have been raised by the London Finance Commission. We will enable direct learning through a meeting of senior operational planners and managers from each city and indirect learning through inviting user groups (widened through snowballing via our research interviews and contacts) to impact workshops and city-wide community conferences. The impacts of these developments on local residents and businesses raise concerns about how local residents and business groups can build effective engagements with planners and increasingly with developers. We will explore this through action-research with community groups in London and Johannesburg, with direct impacts for these groups and wider implications for communities and governments across these cities and in other contexts. 
Our key research question, as to whether and how democratic forms of large scale urban development can be enabled, is crucial to the future of cities in all three contexts, and notably so in the UK where strong participatory planning practices, urban tolerance, and a democratic national culture are widely valued. We will disseminate results widely through end of project publications targeting communities and practitioners.

The initial phase evolved around completing a social mapping exercise of the Corridors of Freedom Initiative as a whole. Drawing on this initial report, Planact conducted interviews with 30 stakeholders along segments of the Empire Perth and Louis Botha corridors to collect data from a range of different neighbourhoods. In connection to this groundwork, two community stakeholder forums and two smaller meetings have been organised. The aim of the first stakeholder gathering (June 2016) was to reiterate and outline the ambitions of the CoF project (with the participation of City officials) as well as explain the objectives of the comparative research project. The purpose of the second one, held in November 2016, was to present and test the preliminary findings from the first phase of interviews to understand the priorities of each of the neighbourhoods represented in the room and gauge to what extent it is possible to start engaging across different areas along the corridors.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Support for community events, assistance with design of survey instrument, background information and collaborative engagement with local authorities and planning organisations.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>London Tenant's Federation</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Supporting community engagements in planning through mutual support</gtr:description><gtr:id>DE51C384-5C1B-4C9E-98FD-34B5AC165D7C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A major outcome will be the material influences on the planning process and community capacity for engagement.

The methodology of participation and engagement sits alongside a wider suite of methods involving observation and participation, and proposes a distinctive vantage point from which to develop insights on urban development processes, from the bottom up. The array of activities includes: 
? Attendance at events organized by property developers as part of the statutory and non-statutory consultation process. 
This has proved very useful to network with property interests representatives, identify knowledgeable individuals in the development or consultancy firms involved and to secure interviews. This strategy has proven more successful than emailing potential parties of interest without prior face-to-face interaction. For instance, email demands to Essential Living and Quod were left unanswered, while requests after contact at an event where the researcher introduced herself resulted in positive replies. Examples of events attended include a consultation meeting organized by Cargiant for GUA members, a planning forum to present the North Kensington Gate application submitted to the OPDC by Aurora and Quod, and a public exhibition about the Perfume Factory site run by Essential Living. A short note was produced for each of these three events. 

? Attendance at governmental workshops and committees opened to the public
This has included physically attending planning committee (PC) meetings (also available online) in order to make contact with potential interviewees and introduce to them the research project. Two members of the planning committee have been interviewed; two others agreed in principles but have since not engaged with written communications sent to them directly by the researcher or on her behalf (planning committee secretary circulated an invitation to participate). To avoid creating a feeling of harassment, it is envisaged that a follow up will only occur after a short respite period. Discussions about key aspects of the development process were observed through attendance. This includes the determination of the first planning application for review by the PC and the approval of the amended Statement of Community Involvement (see notes). 

Other events attended include a range of community and business engagement workshops, such as a presentation on the Community Infrastructure Levy, a meeting about the needs and future of businesses located in the Park Royal industrial estate, a workshop on housing in the OPDC area as part of the local plan consultation.

? Support for community meetings
Regular contributions to, attendance at and support for the Grand Union Alliance community meetings. This also helped to recruit participants for in-depth surveys and to better understand how this network of local groups is attempting to shape the future of the OPDC area, how their vision differ from the future imagined by government bodies and/ or developers and the tools they use to influence policy documents that will define the nature of development deemed desirable for the area and will guide decision-makers when assessing planning applications.

International speakers (Liza Weinstein, Donald Leffers and Gaving Shatkin) opened up comparative analysis on this topic. A major outcome was closer links and potential future interactions with practitioners and stakeholders, as well as ongoing intellectual and policy collaborations in Johannesburg.

Workshop Rationale
There is a growing literature on the role of developers in shaping urban change, concerned with their expanding role in planning and urban governance in some contexts, and the way in which the relationship between meeting social need and the search for profit in urban development is embedded in the often complex negotiations between governments and private sector developers over land use. The focus of much of this literature is on North America and Europe, so some important themes relevant to the South African context remain underexplored. And yet it is clear that developers are profoundly reshaping South African cities. For example, developers have not only shaped the city through private-sector led high-end property development, but have also been crucial to the delivery of low cost housing. Perhaps most strikingly, developers have produced a large amount of residential, retail and commercial space for relatively affluent users in the form of cluster housing, gated communities, high rise commercial and residential spaces, and malls. They are also key actors in the transformation of South African cities for less affluent users. Developers are instrumental in implementing the low cost housing programme, which has delivered more than four million houses since 1994. Furthermore, the rental market and the 'affordable market' are growing in importance in both brownfield and greenfield sites, including important examples of high risk-taking developments which have remade significant parts of the city, such as downtown Johannesburg. More systemically, as city governments are reliant on property tax income, the role of local &amp;quot;government&amp;quot; can sometimes appear more in the mode of &amp;quot;developer&amp;quot;. This workshop will seek to develop analyses of the role of developers in shaping South African cities, including the array of actors who work as part of developers' teams, such as technical consultants and financiers. 

Format: 
Urban Lab: 'Urban Developers and Government': This urban lab is part of a monthly series organised by Prof Phil Harrison's unit at Wits University (South African Research Chair in Spatial Analysis and City Planning). The purpose of this particular lab is to bring together officials, developers, stakeholders and researchers who are interested in the nature of the relationships between developers and various spheres and sectors of government. Given that the 2015/2016 City of Johannesburg Spatial Development Framework is about to be finalised, the particular focus of discussion will be on the role this Framework will play in guiding development in the city. The lab will consist of a half day programme (the morning of 26 July) in which participants will be invited to use any of the following questions as prompts for discussion:
1. What impact have government spatial plans and visions had on the work of developers? 
2. What impact will the 2015/2016 Spatial Development Framework have on developers in Johannesburg? (The draft 2015/2016 SDF is available here http://bit.ly/joburg-sdf-16)
3. How do developers and different spheres and sectors of government relate to one another? 
4. What changes should be considered to the way in which urban development happens in South Africa? 
In addition contributors to the urban lab may wish to reflect on any of the questions posed below for the academic workshop or indeed any other themes they consider to be important. 

Academic workshop: Participants in the urban lab are invited to stay on for the academic workshop should they wish to do so. Although the focus will be on South Africa, several international speakers will bring in a comparative perspective. Academics and researchers presenting papers will invariably pick up on many of the questions raised in the urban lab. In addition they may also tackle any of the following questions: 
1. What is the developer 'ecosystem'? How can developers be classified into different types (market, size, ownership, geographical focus)? 
2. What are the basic business models which developers follow? (i.e. what are the key economic opportunities driving the various urban development markets?)
3. How are developers constituted organisationally and also within networks of financiers, consultants, construction firms, officials, and other key actors?
4. What is the journey from CGI to ribbon cutting? How do visions shift and what shapes the evolution of an urban development project?
5. What are the transnational flows of resources and expertise both into and out of South Africa? 
6. How do local conditions reshape international flows of resources, expertise and business ventures?
7. How are governance arrangements and the broader relationships between developers and government playing out?

As this is very challenging to achieve in large scale developments, the methodologies adopted here in collaboration with our partners, Planact and the London Tenant's Federation, are innovative and potential useful in other situations. A community conference is planned in each city to share these insights.
The findings on the role of the state and the relationship between the state and developers in urban development in Shanghai, London and Johannesburg has informed community based analyses of land value capture, and engagements with London wide planning processes. Further community based research in London is confirming our findings. This will feed into debates and discussions on changing land value capture mechanisms in London. The comparative experiences of China (where land value benefits are fed forward into future developments through development corporation profits) and Johannesburg (where property taxes at a metropolitan scale allow value capture to be directed strategically across the city) inform these inputs. In Johannesburg, close relationships with city officials and developers have allowed interim findings on the potential for institutional innovation to be shared directly with practitioners. Practitioner workshops in each city and a joint workshop in London in late 2017/early 2018 will take this agenda forward.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>5BBC4CCF-FBDB-4BAE-AF63-7954BA85FA47</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>58ca86bad87c68.03052956</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Research is half way through the funded period, and more than 100 in-depth interviews have been conducted in Johannesburg, London and Shanghai. A few preliminary results are listed here for each case, and the initial directions for comparative analysis follow.
1. Johannesburg: We find that the challenges of drawing developers from suburban high or very low income developments to inner city low-income housing provision are substantial. In addition, the need to create institutional capacity to work across different neighbourhoods and government departments is driving governance innovations. The demands of limited institutional capacity on development actors are significant.
2. Shanghai: We find here the wide range of state actors involved in the development suggests a complex field of operation, design, financing and innovation which brings a new perspective to the role of the state in urban development. In addition, the importance of the development for strategic economic development is a feature which bears comparison with the other cases, driven more by housing and property development.
3. London: The demands for financing are driving innovation in land value capture; and institutional innovations include the implementation of a Mayoral Development Corporation and initiatives in community participation. The potential for a strong role for the state in neoliberalised contexts of urban development is being revealed.

Comparative analyses: We anticipate bringing these together around the institutional dynamics associated with land value capture; the different roles of communities in relation to how they benefit from the development; the role of the state in urban development.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We anticipate opportunities for further cases in the cities we are studying to confirm our wider findings; and comparative work on additional cases in order to explore a wider variety of institutional forms of urban development.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>CEFC8EAE-88D1-4D07-ADF1-165F5C8B51C3</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58ca8561470d01.69395192</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Creative Economy,Environment,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.urbantransformations.ox.ac.uk/blog/2017/2699/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Across three sites close to 100 in-depth interviews have been conducted with government, planning consultants and private developers and community actors in three large scale urban developments.
