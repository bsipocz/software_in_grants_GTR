This is an increasingly 'hot' topic in contemporary analytic philosophy. The volume of new articles published about it is growing rapidly, and there have been recent conferences (in UK and USA) dedicated to it and related topics such as trust. The proposed book, to be published by Oxford University Press, will attract wide interest amongst philosophers with an interest in epistemology including the growing field of 'social epistemology', and equally amongst those interested in philosophy of language especially speech act theory, pragmatics and communication theory. It is non-technical, and will be accessible to students, both graduate and undergraduate. It will surely become, along with C.A.J.Coady's 'Testimony' (OUP 1992), required reading on this topic. The topic forms part of a standard undergraduate course in epistemology, and as such is part of the core subject matter of analytic philosophy as widely studied in UK and throughout North America. Thus I expect a very large and widespread audience for the proposed book.\n\n'Testimony' here covers all the variety of ways by which we gain knowledge from others' spoken or written words, when these are aimed at factual communication. Acts of testifying are made through face-to-face personal communication, and also telephone calls, e-mails, and personal letters. Newspapers, radio and TV broadcasts; textbooks, histories, and purportedly factual writings of many kinds also offer testimony, in this broad sense. Knowledge can be disseminated through them.\n\nIn a modern society division of epistemic labour is the rule. Most of what each of us knows is learned from testimony, and still relies on that source: our knowledge of history, geography, the sciences, technology; even our own early life and family history. This massive epistemic dependence goes with massive practical dependence on others in our daily lives - our computer technicians, motor mechanics, doctors, airtraffic controllers, builders...and so on. Not to mention the trust we regularly and unthinkingly place in our family, friends and colleagues, for information of all kinds about daily matters.\nThis extensive reliance on others' testimony as a source of knowledge has been surprisingly neglected in analytic philosophy until recently. My book addresses key questions that arise in its light: Do we have any knowledge at all which is uninfected by epistemic dependence on testimony? Is it possible, in principle, to live out the life of an epistemic autonome, who refuses to accept anything as true, unless she herself possesses the evidence for it? If not, how much of our epistemic self-governance do we lose, through this dependence on the word of others? What are the sorts of circumstance in which one may or should rely on another's word? Can these ever include deference to another's judgement about a moral matter? -Or an aesthetic one?\n\nFirst I ask: What is the basic mechanism by which knowledge is acquired from an act of testifying? My account of testimony as a means of sharing knowledge is rooted in the account I develop of the speech act of asserting - the way in which we use language to tell things we know to other people, thus passing on our knowledge. One who asserts that P gives her word that P to her audience; she offers him a licence to believe that P on her say-so. When the audience of such a telling forms belief that P on the teller's say-so, he takes her to know that P, and believes P himself on that basis. In this way, starting from the speech act of assertion, I show that knowledge based on trust in testimony is essentially knowledge at second-hand: a hearer cannot come to know that P from trusting a speaker's testimony, unless the speaker herself knows what she tells. This principleis intuitive, but only my account provides a deep explanation of it.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-01-10</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-10-11</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>28163</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>My findings continue to be disseminated within the philosophical academic community, and others are undertaking work engaging with them, or otherwise taking them further.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>FA5D14F8-468B-465C-9BDF-1B3F47A9589F</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>545ce09238b697.83852111</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>I have developed an integrated theory of a number of key issues in the philosophical understanding of testimony (the written or spoken word of others) as epistemic source and communicative act.
