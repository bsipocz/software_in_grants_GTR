Network</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>MR/J00488X/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Every year scientific journals publish tens of thousands of articles describing findings from health research studies. However, readers and users of these articles, who include scientists, clinicians, systematic reviewers, and increasingly also patients, find many of these articles very difficult or impossible to use: many articles do not present enough information, present only selected information, or present information in a very unclear and misleading way. All this makes many papers unusable. The effort and money devoted to the research described in such an unsatisfactory manner is wasted. 
A simple solution to improve the completeness, accuracy and clarity of research papers is to follow reporting guidelines. Many guidelines exist that provide step by step guidance of what should be addressed in a paper reporting on a particular type of health research. These guidelines have been developed from the users' perspective and guide authors to provide minimum information a user needs to assess how well was the study done, to decide if the findings are relevant to his/her own work, and if needed to reproduce the study (ie. what was actually done and to whom, what was assessed and how, how were these findings analysed, and what they actually mean in the context of other similar studies). Although many good guidelines exist they are still not widely known and used by health scientists. Recent reviews of publications consistently show that essential information is missing from a large proportion of research articles. 
 
In this time of massive information overload it is important to have a single good quality resource where you can easily find all relevant information you need. In 2008, we launched the EQUATOR programme that aims to enhance the quality and transparency of health research. One of the most important outputs of this programme is a free online Library for Health Research Reporting that brings together all published reporting guidelines and other helpful tools that aid the writing and publication of research reports and thus improve the information provided to readers. 
The EQUATOR team educates scientist and journal editors, who play a key role in safeguarding the quality of published papers, to increase their knowledge of what should be included in research papers and how best to achieve it. 
EQUATOR also helps scientists to develop high quality reporting guidelines and conducts research investigating problems in research reporting. 
 
Our proposal outlines specific deliverables and activities for the next three years that will further advance the programme. The main outputs include: improved structure and content of our Library; development of unique EQUATOR 'signature' courses supporting rigorous research reporting; compilation of a manual for the development of robust reporting guidelines; a research report summarising the use of reporting guidelines by selected priority journals; and a database of evaluations of reporting quality of scientific papers across health research specialties. 
 
Medical journals publish large numbers of research reports that are of limited value because of crucial omissions. This waste is avoidable. The EQUATOR website and training can be compared to a well stocked and well promoted supermarket where you can get everything you need to write and publish first class research papers. The knowledge of what needs to be included in research papers that are clear and easy to use also improves the design of future research studies. Our work helps to improve usability and usefulness of published medical research and helps scientists to become outstanding research communicators.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The EQUATOR Network is an international initiative that seeks to improve the reliability and value of the published health research literature by promoting transparent and accurate reporting. The main focus of our activities is to support scientists, editors, and peer reviewers in writing and publishing well reported research studies that are easy to appraise and use in further research, clinical practice and policy-making. Indirectly, EQUATOR supports the improvement of the design and conduct of future research studies. 
The EQUATOR Network developed a unique online Library for Health Research Reporting that pulls together all guidelines for reporting health research studies. We promote rigorous research reporting, introduce available reporting guidelines, and support their use through a wide range of activities. Our research programme informs all aspects of the EQUATOR work, such as further Library development, teaching activities, and assisting in the development of new reporting guidelines. Examples of our recent projects include a systematic review of reporting guidelines; a survey of reporting guideline developers; publication of guidance on how to develop reporting guidelines; a survey of journals' instructions to authors and peer reviewers (ongoing); and development of a tool assessing the quality of reporting guidelines (ongoing). 
 
The EQUATOR Network is seeking continuation of its MRC financial support for the period of 2011 - 2014 to further advance its programme. This proposal outlines specific deliverables and activities for the next three years. The main outputs include: 
- Upgraded online Library for Health Research Reporting 
- First two of the EQUATOR 'signature' courses (for methodology editors; for research students) 
- Manual for the development of reporting guidelines 
- Research report summarising the use of reporting guidelines by journals 
- Database of evaluations of reporting quality across health research specialties</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The work of EQUATOR increases the usability of available research evidence which facilitates its better translation into practice. Our work supports the work of organisations like the Cochrane Collaboration in the development of systematic reviews and NICE in the development of clinical practice guidelines. EQUATOR also helps research funders maximise the utility of new information arising from the research they fund. 
 
Since its launch three and half years ago the EQUATOR website has attracted 165,000 visits (around 115,000 unique visitors) from almost all countries in the world. The use of our resources is constantly increasing (in May 2011 we had almost 7,000 visits). Reference to EQUATOR and reporting guidelines is included in the most used and required guidance for preparing biomedical manuscripts developed by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, and in many journals' instructions to authors, including the world's leading medical journals such as the Lancet, JAMA, BMJ, etc.. 
 
Currently much research reporting is inadequate. Reporting guidelines are important and effective tools for achieving high standards in reporting health studies. In order to reach their potential, reporting guidelines need to be implemented widely and routinely by researchers, authors, editors and peer reviewers. Availability of easily accessible robust guidelines, awareness of their existence and knowledge on how to use them facilitates their use.

The EQUATOR Decision Tree was created
2. The EQUATOR Wizard was developed, using the Decision Tree as a basis. 
3. The prototype Wizard was piloted in February 2016. http://www.equator-network.org/2016/02/17/its-a-kind-of-magic-how-to-improve-adherence-to-reporting-guidelines/ In a before-after analysis, BioMed Central embedded the decision-tree tool in the submission system for four journals in the BMC series. In total, 590 manuscripts were included in this analysis - 300 in the before cohort and 290 in the after. There was a significant increase in manuscripts where authors had identified the correct reporting guidelines for their study type - 16% in the before cohort and 25% in the after cohort. There was also a significant decrease in manuscripts where authors incorrectly stated that there were no relevant guidelines - 27% in the before cohort and 16% in the after cohort. These results suggest that providing authors with a tool to assist in identifying the correct reporting guidelines for their study improved the identification of the correct reporting guidelines. 
4. The results of the pilot were presented at a conference of journal editors.

The course aims to build the skills and confidence to achieve success in planning, writing, publishing and disseminating research through traditional journals and other media channels. The course is lead by an experienced, enthusiastic and knowledgeable team, featuring lectures and many practical sessions including:
How to write the key sections of your research article, including the methods, analysis and results, introduction, discussion, title and abstract
How to make the appropriate and optimal use of Reporting Guidelines including CONSORT, STROBE and PRISMA
How to target the right journal for your research, and navigate different editorial systems
How to deal with peer review comments, and how to peer review the work of others constructively
How to write for and communicate with a lay audience, and make the most of media opportunities
The course also discusses the importance of writing and publishing protocols, and the use of reporting guidelines such as SPIRIT and PRISMA-P.

Most of the course instructors are members of the UK EQUATOR Centre. A member of the Australian EQUATOR Centre, Elaine Beller, joined the instructor team in 2016 to experience the course. As a result, the Australian Centre offered a two-day version of Publication School at Bond University in December 2016.

Making the research publication process more efficient and responsible: practical ways to improve the reliability and usability of published (health) research

Session moderators: 
Iveta Simera, EQUATOR Network, Centre for Statistics in Medicine, NDORMS, University of Oxford, UK
Trish Groves, BMJ, EQUATOR Network Steering Group member

Target audience:
Editors, researchers (in roles of research authors and peer reviewers), university professionals, policy makers, publishers

Background:
Complete, accurate and transparent reporting is an integral part of responsible research conduct. Unfortunately substantial evidence has demonstrated serious deficiencies in the reporting of research studies. Health research literature has become the most scrutinised area due to the rapid expansion in the production of systematic reviews and the direct impact the results of such reviews can have on patients' care. However, other fields such as the veterinary sciences are quickly catching up, indicating that reporting deficiencies will become a problem across the sciences. Despite considerable resources invested in health research, it is clear that the usability and usefulness of research results are often severely limited because of poor reporting in research publications. Enormous financial and human resources are wasted as a result. 
Although ultimate responsibility for the design, conduct and accurate publication of studies lies with the researchers, a coordinated effort of all parties involved in (health) research and its publication is urgently needed to remedy the current unsustainable situation.

Session format:
Four short talks (15 minutes) followed by a longer constructive discussion aiming to arrive at some specific and practical suggestions to improve research publication process and outcomes, total session length 1 &amp;frac12; - 2 hours.
Session content will mainly focus on examples from biomedical research but we believe that it will be in principle applicable to other related scientific fields.

Please see the attached flyer. Registration and abstract submission is available here: http://researchwaste.net/research-wasteequator-conference/. The Conference targeted health research scientists and clinicians, journal editors and peer reviewers, publishers, regulators, research funders and other professionals involved in research education, research governance and the publication of medical research.

The focus of the conference was to:
? Combine EQUATOR and REWARD themes in one conference
? Recap The Lancet series findings and recommendations
? Review the progress made by researchers, funders, regulators, publishers, industry, and research users against the recommendations in the series
? Bring out specific themes for making research better and more efficient, e.g.: collaboration between researchers, funders, conduct/reporting organisations, regulatory authorities and publishers; specific perspectives of each of these groups of key players.
? Derive a consensus statement and action plan for making progress against the recommendations of the series, after presentations and a constructive moderated discussion
? Seek endorsement for the consensus statement

Speakers included:
Prof Doug Altman, Prof Rustam Al-Shahi Salman, Sir Iain Chalmers, Dr An-Wen Chan, Prof Paul Glasziou, Dr Trish Groves, Prof John Ioannidis, Prof Frank Miedema, Dr David Moher, Prof Andrew Morris (Chief Scientist, Scotland), Dr Iveta Simera and Dr Janet Wisely (HRA).

The course provides an overview of key steps and common methods in medical research and its publication. It is divided into four modules, delivered as three half-day sessions and one full-day session at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK. 
 The four modules are
1. Research planning: before you start your research project
2. Research design and protocol 
3. Statistical thinking 
4. Research publication and dissemination 

The course runs on Saturdays to take account of the limited availability of clinicians on the Academic Clinical Training. The course is now run twice a year, and has been run: September-November 2014, September-November 2015, and February-April 2016, September-November 2016, and February-April 2017.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e014a08fdbf8.41880337</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.equator-network.org/2015/09/22/oucags_2015/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014,2015,2016,2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>9000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>USD</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>Ecuador</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>es_EC</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Pan American Health Organization support</gtr:description><gtr:end>2014-06-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Pan American Health Organization</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>5F1EBBBB-7D97-4EE9-A20E-0716B4F7CAD7</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>R88vNoXsdXV</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-05-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>240000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>NIHR Grant</gtr:description><gtr:end>2013-03-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>National Institute for Health Research</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>26B10A66-059A-470A-BDC1-CB2792307052</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>M69LPJaYf1v0</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2010-04-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>160000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Health Research Authority - collaboration</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-03-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>NHS Health Research Authority</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>CEA34EC4-6068-4336-B0EC-DE240EF4E22D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e03ae89a6e41.66338174</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-04-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>15000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>CSO Grant</gtr:description><gtr:end>2012-03-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Chief Scientist Office (CSO)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>0D4C7896-0467-4BD2-B557-D1B1DE3B5597</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>H6LJ7kCZYYN0</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2009-04-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>100000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:department>NHS Institute for Innovation and Improvement</gtr:department><gtr:description>National Institute for Innovation and Improvement Grant</gtr:description><gtr:end>2009-04-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>NHS England</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>B864BA5B-C1A7-4E82-A7DE-642FA729FB25</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>MZdQRzruBLD0</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2008-03-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>117000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>NIHR Health Technology Assessment</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-03-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>National Institute for Health Research</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>1E43C3E9-CEE1-4342-98B1-96A2E9BAA5F8</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58ca9c6c8e8180.00919971</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-04-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Peer Review Policy on Cochrane Reviews - Advisory Group</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F88C65DC-EE45-47CF-A4E5-DD4A9AD6788C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Caroline Struthers served on the Cochrane peer review policy advisory group, where she shaped Cochrane peer review policy.

Maneesh Juneja: Digital Health Futurist, MJ Analytics 

I just wanted to say that seeing the play was simply wonderful. There were two very high profile events in London this week, both talking about putting patients first, which didn't actually do that (no patients involved in curating the event, and no patients speaking on stage). One was at Nesta, the other was at City Hall, supported by the Mayor's office. Both left me feeling very sad that the focus seemed to be on the needs of the healthcare system, not the patients. So, People are Messy, and finding out about the amazing work you are doing in PPI was a much needed antidote, and gave me hope that there are organisations that truly understand what is needed in this country and beyond. I've never considered theatre as a mechanism for change in research until I saw People are Messy. 

Tony Stroker: Head of Drama, The Oratory School, Reading 

I would just like to say that we were thrilled with the show - the boys were gripped by the whole thing and have told me how much they enjoyed it; live theatre at its best. The interactive voting is a great idea and very effectively engaged the audience in the issues being explored. It was a powerful and compelling experience for everyone there. I am so glad that we were able to get 'People are Messy' on at the Oratory School. Please pass on my thanks to the cast for their superb performances. If there are any future productions from the Theatre of Debate please consider the Oratory School for a performance - we would be delighted to welcome you back.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56e04adc8914e1.21733606</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://theatreofdebate.co.uk/PeopleareMessy/PeopleareMessy.html</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Membership of Cochrane Consumer Executive Group</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F511202A-E3F2-4E01-8A58-FD8B3C523332</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Caroline Struthers served on the Cochrane Consumer Executive Committee with the aim of increasing the meaningful participation of patients and the public in Cochrane systems and governance.

In total, 590 manuscripts were included in this analysis - 300 in the before cohort and 290 in the after. There was a significant increase in manuscripts where authors had identified the correct reporting guidelines for their study type - 16% in the before cohort and 25% in the after cohort. There was also a significant decrease in manuscripts where authors incorrectly stated that there were no relevant guidelines - 27% in the before cohort and 16% in the after cohort. These results suggest that providing authors with a tool to assist in identifying the correct reporting guidelines for their study improved the identification of the correct reporting guidelines. The results of this pilot were presented at a conference of journal editors.
