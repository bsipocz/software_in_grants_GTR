Some will see increasing citizen participation as essential for democracy and the legitimacy of any particular administration, others will emphasise the economic and social benefits to be derived from 'co-production'. Many will see it as simply 'the right thing to do'. Here I offer some general recommendations based on the findings of this research project which may have some resonance with all these groups.
The enthusiasm and commitment of individuals working to increase citizen participation are essential to producing and sustaining change, and the networking theory and practice used widely by intermediaries like the RSA can make the total impact much greater than the sum of its individual parts. Leadership and 'modelling good behaviour' from the top are also important, and indeed, without individual and collective action, change will not happen at all. Having said this, the main lesson to be derived from the findings of this research is that such efforts are essential but not sufficient in themselves, and an undue focus on them risks implementing only half a strategy for change. The established ways of doing things and the embedded power relationships in a city play at least as much part in promoting, or discouraging, participation, and securing an enduring impact for efforts at engagement.
This institutional perspective also helps us define more clearly what we mean when we talk about innovation and transformation in relation to citizen participation. For there is a danger that by elevating innovation to the production of ideas and action that no-one has ever thought of before, and transformation to a new state of things that is also beyond our previous experience, that we give the impression to 'ordinary citizens' that only experts and very clever people can contribute to such a sophisticated process. Rather than the creation of the 'genuinely new', in politics, as in most other areas of life, innovation and transformation are usually produced from bringing together pre-existing ways of doing things in novel ways which lead to very different, and hopefully beneficial, effects. In this way the recombination of rather ordinary materials can result in projects which transform the lives of millions (for example the formation of the National Health Service in the UK in 1945).
Here, therefore, based on previous experience, in any given situation I take for granted the presence of gifted individuals of good will who wish to increase citizen participation, and suggest how the combination of CLEAR, the 3D framework and the concept of complementarities used in this research can be deployed to work with established ways of doing things and the embedded power relationships, while retaining space for innovation and transformation of the recombinative type. 
Strategy and presentation 
The practice of politics will usually benefit from strong leadership, but at a more mundane level it relies on persuading fellow politicians, managers and citizens to support a policy, or, at least, not actively oppose it. In this way, a strong narrative is as important as a strong leader, and this in turn implies the need for consistent strategy and presentation. In terms of citizen participation, such a strategy can, in principle, be presented as both experimental and transformational, but as we saw with the CPP programme, the two themes need to be very carefully bound into a single coherent account, if they are to hold together under hostile scrutiny. 
If a choice is to be made between the two, then a narrative which majors on experimentation and innovation is likely to describe a short term and small scale project, which, as an outcome, will give an indication of what is possible, but is unlikely to be transformative in itself. In terms of complementarities with local economic policy, the possibilities of failure and 'wasted' effort need to be factored into the narrative as risks worth taking for greater rewards further down the line, and in this way such a project needs to be protected to a large extent from short term concerns about performance indicators and targets and outcome measures. Useful reference can be made here to practices in the private sector where large sums of investors' money are spent on research and development in what are often experimental ventures. 
On the other hand, a narrative which has transformation as its destination looks to longer term horizons and an expectation that all available resources will be redesigned for maximum efficiency. Complementarities with local economic policy can relatively easily be developed here therefore, but again some protection from short term and premature demands for evaluation may be required to properly reflect the long term nature of the strategy. Indeed, in most circumstances, it may be wiser to develop a conviction based narrative around citizen participation as simply 'the right thing to do', rather than creating hostages to fortune by tying it into targets and outcome measures, and an increase in local economic performance.
It is particularly important in a project which seeks to increase citizen participation to develop a strategy and narrative which are consistent on the expert v citizen mix. CLEAR itself recognises the need for community led action to be encouraged and fostered by intermediaries and the centre, so this is not as simple as suggesting that outside expertise should be used sparingly. Indeed, in the CPP programme we saw that the strands which used templates which had been successful elsewhere were able to recreate this impact in Peterborough. Nevertheless, the institutional mapping which I describe below will help to pick up particular sensitivities, and we also need to be aware that both elected members and citizens themselves will tend to question the criteria for choosing 'expert citizens' where this hybrid concept is used as a device to bridge the gap between the two roles.
Finally, because there is a continuing process of persuasion and negotiation going on here, to some extent, an emergent, rather than fully preplanned, strategy is inevitable. However unwelcome surprises can be kept to a minimum by undertaking institutional mapping, and it will be important to keep a check on both the number of strands developed and the potential for complementarities (both internal and external) across these. In the worst case scenario a large number of strands which offer each other few possibilities for complementarities will not only make the task of managing the resultant programme extremely onerous, but will also increase the difficulty in persuading stakeholders that the programme represents a coherent whole worthy of their support. 
Institutional Mapping
Institutional mapping and development of strategy and presentation are best conducted at the same time rather than sequentially, so that they can inform one another. The process of institutional mapping itself is very similar to the application of the 3D framework and Russian Doll strategy in this research, but is scaled down to fit the limited amount of time which is normally available before a programme is launched. Crucially, it is used to identify and anticipate blockages and facilitators of change, rather than to produce a retrospective analysis. Institutional mapping differs from a conventional scoping exercise in that it offers a systematic and distinctively political approach analysis of the policy context, whereas scoping can often be unduly influenced by the emergent nature of strategies for intervention and a tendency to provide post hoc rationales for these.
The mapping process starts therefore with defining a timeframe through which to go back and identify key policy areas in citizen participation and trace how they have developed in the context of the city overall. As we have seen is this report, 'process tracing' of the development of citizen participation within the specific context of the politics in that city can give us vital insights into why the proposals for certain new projects might be embraced by key stakeholders and others might meet opposition. This also produces an audit of citizen participation as a whole and identifies policy areas in which new projects can convincingly be narrated as producing complementarities, rather than duplication.
The mapping then of horizontal relationships systematically exposes which policies and organisations are already connected into any particular policy area and what complementarities and holes are apparent in the policy framework from this perspective. Combined with evidence from the process tracing of citizen participation in the city, it also shows what rationales key intermediaries have for being involved, and what power base they command in terms of driving forward or blocking change.
The mapping of vertical relationships gives an estimate of the quantity and quality of citizen involvement in any policy arena and the levels of cohesion or fragmentation in and across the groups who are engaged. A similar analysis is carried out for the centre taking special care to understand that in some cases there will be multiple centres (eg the LSP, the Cabinet, the senior management team), and that these themselves are unlikely to be able to act in concert as a homogenous block. Again it is important to understand the factionalism within any group and what deep seated rationales central actors have for being involved in the policy area and what power base they command in terms of driving forward or blocking change.
When the three mapping components are pulled together a picture of engagement emerges which shows how the power relationships in any policy area have developed and where the opportunities for building complementarities through new projects may lie. It identifies those policy areas which are already crowded and those which are relatively under populated. While the former will offer more opportunities to create horizontal linkages, they will also be more risky in terms of the possibilities of duplication, and will require particular thought to be given to why they will produce something recognisably different. The latter will offer more scope for bringing in a template from previous work to fill the policy space, but may suffer from a lack of pre-existing vertical and horizontal structures on which to anchor the new way of working.
The sorts of questions which can then be answered are: what are the existing policy frameworks in this area? How do they link from council to citizen level? Who are the intermediaries who can drive new projects in citizen participation forward or veto them? What are the key coalitions and factions in the local political structure? How will the new policies link into other related areas? Will this generate complementarity or duplication, support or resistance? 
Reconfiguration and maintenance
The strategic decisions which can be made as a result of institutional mapping will temper the emergent nature of the planning process and lead to some policy areas being left out of a new programme because they are already functioning well, or generally too crowded, and others being adopted as ripe for development. The reconfiguration process then revolves around how the new projects selected can be operationalised within the institutional map of the city.
Where templates are available from previous projects as with the CPP programme, these have the advantage of coming with a readymade sense of complementarity and are easier to narrate than projects which are to be presented as 'genuinely new'. However, there does need to be some explicit fit between these and the specific context of the city, and careful attention to the handling of the citizen v expert dilemma is also required. Just as, in most cases, there will need to be a strategic choice between experimentation and transformation, so in reconfiguration there is a decision to be made about whether the new relationships which are added into the existing configuration are primarily intended to reform, or disrupt, the current pattern. 
The theory behind institutional mapping tends to tilt it towards reform and transformation through the remapping of long embedded power relationships. But there is no reason why complementarities cannot be introduced to any particular policy area which actually challenge the existing power relationships and consciously destabilise them. In both cases the objective is to use the specific knowledge accumulated to anticipate the impacts of intervention, and develop strategies for maximising support and responding to resistance, which can be put these in place before the programme starts, and are available throughout its life.
Finally, arrangements for maintenance, sometimes termed legacy or sustainability, also need to be considered before a programme begins, and continuously developed through its lifespan. If the strategy is based on experimentation and innovation, then in principle, at least, there may be only a slim rationale for continuing maintenance, since the characteristic of an experiment is that it has a short life and does not necessary leave any legacy in the place where it was conducted. Both ethical and economic considerations, however, will militate against such a purist calculation, and the sort of questions which need to be asked in all cases at the earliest stage are: what are the most important links which need to be established and maintained to ensure the project will continue in some shape after the intervention? And who will maintain these links into the future? 
Again, in principle, it is possible to promote the idea of self sustaining networks which continue after the programme and the personnel have left the scene. However the theory behind the CLEAR framework and the associated research, including the findings of this report, suggest that this represents an unduly optimistic view of the capacity of community based groups to benefit from relatively short term interventions. Building on well established foundations whether through templates and/or existing horizontal and vertical relationships is a much more likely route to legacy and sustainability. Horizontal relationships are important not only for anchoring citizen participation in a particular policy area, but also for coalition building and creating scale, both of which tend to attract politicians' and the wider public's attention. CLEAR particularly highlights the importance of building and maintaining vertical relationships with the centre, and while this can be a superior partner organisation like the Local Strategic Partnership, it needs to be borne in mind that these actors' first loyalties and accountabilities are to their parent organisations, and as such they may not be able to provide the sustained and robust support which a well maintained, long term intervention requires. Despite the hostility expressed towards them by central government and sometimes by citizens, for the foreseeable future, local councils are best placed to promote citizen participation and only with their wholehearted and generous support to 'ordinary people' are initiatives in citizen empowerment likely to succeed.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings have been taken forward by the RSA in planning future Citizen Power projects</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>7270148A-8390-4747-B108-AD032C54DD3A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-6904655012.213304775eb8cc</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5A35D446-FD0F-46D3-A256-DB71ED51F1A9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Communication breakdown: understanding the role of policy narratives in political conflict and consensus</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Critical Policy Studies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/46e84ea763bb71dd8f65c2efe70ef166"><gtr:id>46e84ea763bb71dd8f65c2efe70ef166</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Roberts M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58b54effcc0576.43906003</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/J500501/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
