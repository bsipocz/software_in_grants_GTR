With many students anxious about learning statistics and seeing methods training as detached from the rest of their degree, the project focus is on the greater use of quantitative data into substantive teaching. To this end the project has recruited eight named ?Teaching Partners? in Politics and Sociology at Manchester with whom to develop, pilot and evaluate quantitative exemplars and tutorial exercises in their teaching on nominated courses.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The aim is to create degree programmes&amp;nbsp; in which students better appreciate the relevance and research contribution of quantitative approaches to their discipline, and consequently to see the acquisition of quantitative skills as an integral part of their studies. The project will evaluate the impact of these innovations on a cohort of students, including the extent to which more students go on to use QM in their final year dissertations. After extensive in-house piloting and evaluation these teaching materials will be re-purposed as a teaching resource for the wider HE community.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The major beneficiaries of the project will be academic teaching staff and undergraduate students in the Social Sciences (see 'Academic Beneficiaries' for more detail). In Manchester, this includes the partner-lecturers with whom we are directly collaborating to develop materials for use in their own teaching, and their students who will benefit from these innovations. The development of our materials as a free, flexible and web-accessible teaching resource will ensure the impact extends to the wider UK teaching community, and the students they serve. 
This project will also have a wider impact on the following groups: 
1) The project will help the Royal Statistical Society's getstats programme by increasing the statistical literacy of a large number of undergraduate social science students at Manchester (from year 1 onwards) and elsewhere. 
2) Employers in the public and private sectors will benefit from a better skilled graduate workforce that is statistically literate, and familiar with quantitative analysis. One of the direct outcomes of the project is the students' ability to download and assess data from UK, EU and other international datasets, which could be of immense help in assessing evidence and making decisions for local authorities, government agencies, charities, and marketing organisations who constitute a large section of employers of Manchester social science undergraduates. 
3) Directors of postgraduate taught and research programmes in the social sciences will benefit from a statistically literate graduate population interested in pursuing postgraduate education. The project could increase the range of methodologies adopted in Masters and PhD dissertations, and could also have an impact on the quality of Advanced Quantitative Methods studentship applications to the North-West ESRC Doctoral Training Centre. 
4) The project will also have an impact on the Economic and Social Data Service (our partners in the delivery of the project) by making their materials and datasets more widely used. Wider dissemination of their activities and outputs is one of their key aims. At present, these groups have strong connections with social science postgraduates, but rather weaker links with social science undergraduates. The project will help disseminate and embed their resources directly into the social science undergraduate curriculum.
5) Members of learned Societies such as the British Sociological Association, the Royal Statistical Society, and the Political Studies Association and participants in their annual conferences will be able to benefit from our presentations to these groups.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-03-25</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-03-26</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>80541</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>1423000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:department>Q-Step</gtr:department><gtr:description>Manchester Q-Step Centre</gtr:description><gtr:end>2018-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Nuffield Foundation</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>402A16C3-68E9-4D93-893E-FF1A9E617324</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546488bb1f5f66.38968666</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>By developing new models (and teaching materials) for delivering quantitative training in the undergraduate Social Science curriculum, we have made a direct impact on the strategic need for better skilled graduates. The impact goes beyond the 8 named courses of the original bid, as our ideas and materials are already being taken up by other teaching staff at Manchester (we have worked with 13 lecturers to date). We have also made an external impact beyond Manchester through an active dissemination programme (boosted by activities of a linked ESRC RDI project). This has included a number of staff training workshops (held in Manchester and elsewhere), videos and other web-based outputs (case studies and briefing papers) all designed to maximise the number of users of our teaching materials across the wider HE community (all our materials are being made freely available under creative commons licence). We are also making an impact through active contribution to national debates on the quantitative skills challenge (policy and practice) through conference presentations and journal publications. Finally the project has provided the foundations for a successful application to become a national Q-Step Centre. The Q-Step award (with related institutional investment) ensures we have been able to scale up the impact of our project outputs (quantitative embedding is a key component of our Q-Step Centre activities) within Manchester and nationally via the Q-Step network, making a significant and sustainable impact on the national quantitative skills deficit, with positive benefits for UK economy and society.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>F1438719-EF13-4234-BEBC-4D4FE999E666</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:outcomeId>5464af7715f6e1.98324277</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Responding to a strategic call to address the dearth of quantitative skills among UK social science graduates, the project has developed an effective model for introducing quantitative data and skills training into the substantive curriculum (which we call 'quantitative embedding'). This is based on the establishment of teaching partnerships between quantitative experts and substantive lecturers. The partnerships have been used to develop a range of customised teaching materials (from lecture slides to hands on data workshops and interactive tutorials). Our model of curriculum innovation has proved popular among staff (starting out with 8 modules, by the end of the project 13 lecturers had got involved), and student evaluation (still ongoing) has been very positive. We have described and evaluated our model in a paper written for a special edition of the International Journal of Social Research Methodology on the teaching and learning of social research methods . All our materials are being made freely available under creative commons licence (including briefing papers and a series of teaching case studies) and we have engaged in a range of dissemination activities (workshops, videos, conference presentations and journal articles) to ensure we maximise the impact beyond Manchester (see our website http://www.socialsciences.manchester.ac.uk/essted ) 
The project has also involved more targeted initiatives to increase the number of students undertaking quantitative final year dissertations. This includes the development of new courses in data analysis using real world data sets, and a drop-in data support service for final year students. An auditing exercise of dissertation students shows the numbers undertaking secondary data analysis in their dissertations is still relatively small (though increasing). Particularly encouraging is the increase in students taking quantitative options in their final year of study (for example nearly 30 registering this year for a new advanced course in multivariate analysis). 
The research and development activities of the project (along with a linked project funded under the RDI programme) provided the cornerstone for a successful bid to become a National Q-Step Centre. This has enabled us to sustain and scale up our activities in a seamless way (quantitative embedding and dissertation support are key elements of our Q-Step programme) to ensure a lasting and significant contribution to improving quantitative training in the UK Social Sciences. In so doing the project has helped to address a strategic need for better trained and statistically literate social science graduates, which Government and employers have identified as an important condition for economic growth and informed civic engagement.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The programme of quantitative embedding has made an immediate impact on the teaching and learning experience of staff and students at Manchester. Moreover, through external engagement (boosted through the linked ESRC RDI project), including conference presentations, journal publications, workshops, videos and other web-based outputs (case studies and briefing papers) all made available from our project website (http://www.socialsciences.manchester.ac.uk/essted ) , we have been disseminating the ideas and related materials to teachers across the HE sector nationally.
Moving forward the embedding strategy developed in this project contributed directly to the successful Manchester bid to become a Q-Step Centre in 2013. With the considerable extra resource of Q-Step (including the strategic appointment of 4 new lecturers ) we have ensured the embedding programme initiated in Sociology and Politics can not only be sustained but scaled up to include new discipline areas across 3 Schools (Social Sciences, Law and Arts Languages and Cultures ). The fruits of this investment are already apparent in significant development of the curriculum with new quantitative modules and an expanding programme of linked worked placements affecting students across 10 degree programmes 
Moreover, under Q-Step we are able to maintain our programme of external engagement through which we aim to make a high profile contribution to policy and practice in the area of quantitative skills training, with a commitment to disseminate teaching materials developed at Manchester to the wider HE community through conferences, academic writing and via our Q-Step website (www.manchester.ac.uk/q-step/)</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C7F4FFC1-60A7-4DBE-A71C-0CC4F78A74D0</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546498e86ebf78.48863545</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.projects.socialsciences.manchester.ac.uk/essted/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>31092C59-ACF4-4AD3-9DAE-3D9CA2A6A1D9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Embedding quantitative skills into the social science curriculum: case studies from Manchester</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>International Journal of Social Research Methodology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/35ed95dd227d373240e59c417dc003ae"><gtr:id>35ed95dd227d373240e59c417dc003ae</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Buckley J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>546484e46df1f4.32397720</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>7675F6FE-6ED2-4EDA-B9A9-A75C3F5FE6E5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Creative Teaching in Health and Social Care using the UK Data Service</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Health?and Social Care Education</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9a8dea7f187aa95171cd86be0e8d11df"><gtr:id>9a8dea7f187aa95171cd86be0e8d11df</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Carter J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>54638c9e8dbbb6.91514579</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>49464A44-857F-4744-BC9B-0DBFB412BBD2</gtr:id><gtr:title>Engaging Students in Quantitative Methods: it's all about the data</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>BSA Teacher Group Journal</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/090638fccd16c68401cc4ecf870950f7"><gtr:id>090638fccd16c68401cc4ecf870950f7</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Brown M.
