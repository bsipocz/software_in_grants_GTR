The Metropolitan Police Service and Police Academy of the Netherlands are project partners in relation to the European Commission funded work.

In preparing this proposal we have received expressions of support and interest from the Metropolitan Police, the College of Policing, South Wales Police, Home Office and the Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime. This reflects the considerable and growing interest in the police about how to engage with social media, and how it might be used in the aftermath of critical incidents in particular. Specifically, we are planning for the following impacts to develop:

- Police involved in the 'consequence management' of terrorist attacks will be interested in garnering improved knowledge about the dynamics of public reactions in the aftermath of high profile attacks. Indeed, social media informatics opens up new possibilities for the conduct of community impact assessments.
- In mainstream policing, interest is focusing upon how social media might afford new opportunities for community engagement work and better understanding community needs and expectations. The work proposed will provide an important contribution to such efforts.
- One output of the research will be to provide an assessment of official communications by the authorities following an attack. 
As such, the research work will generate new insights into what effects (if any) formal communications have in these kinds of context.

The impacts of the work will be, in part, facilitated by the involvement of the Metropolitan Police and College of Policing who have agreed to support and host two workshops to enable police practitioners to engage with the emerging findings of the study. These events will be important in shaping understandings within user communities about what social media analytics can and cannot do. In addition, the workshops will provide important user feedback to the team in terms of what forms of analysis would be most valued by potential users.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-08-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-02-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>146099</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Article in Police Professional Magazine</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E97E714B-FE40-490D-96C8-E6E17BAA24AD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The article has been influential in the police practitioner community

Based upon a dataset of 35 million data points, it has produced new insights into the social dynamics of collective responses to high profile terrorist incidents, focusing in particular upon understanding processes of social reaction and conflict dynamics. By understanding the social media data as providing 'digital traces' of social action, they have been utilised to provide a uniquely 'high resolution' view of what happens in the aftermath of a terrorist atrocity. Cast in this light, they enabled the illumination of aspects of social reaction that cannot be observed and are thus almost imperceptible when using more orthodox data collection and analysis methods. 
All objectives for the work specified in the proposal have been achieved. They were:
1. To construct a unique dataset that uses social media data to track patterns of social reaction in the aftermath of a high profile crime. This involved cleaning and assessing data already collected by the research team, and engaging in additional data collection activities to provide a continuous chronological series on public opinions and attitudes towards the case beyond the conclusion of the criminal justice process. 
2. To conduct analyses of these data to produce new knowledge about: How public perceptions and attitudes are shaped by high profile 'signal events'; How and why different segments of the public react very differently to the same stimulus; The influence such incidents have upon public opinion; How signal crimes cause a chain of secondary incidents and consequences. Comparative analysis was also undertaken with police data, to examine how public reactions as expressed via social media are associated (or not) with different types of event. The latter data were provided by the Metropolitan Police Service and provide a series of recorded hate crimes in the days and weeks following the murder of Lee Rigby. These have been analysed in conjunction with the social media dataset.
3. To develop opportunities for future research and impact through the design of several data analysis 'apps' and by engaging with policy and practice communities. This included collaborative work with units from the National Counter-Terrorism Functions Command and College of Policing exploring the potential for using the approaches developed by the research to understanding community perceptions of crime and disorder more generally. This has further seeded a broader reflection upon the opportunities presented by social media data for the social sciences.

The key findings from the work completed are thus predicated upon a set of interacting conceptual, empirical and methodological innovations. The analysis of the empirical data focused upon two aspects. The first involved using the fine grained 'high resolution' data that social media affords to develop an in-depth and nuanced understanding of the processes of social reaction in the aftermath of terrorist incidents. This has identified '10 Rs' of social reaction. Conceptually these constitute component parts of the overarching trajectory of reaction, each of which is an online behaviour freighted with 'offline' consequences and impacts. For example, immediately after the murder, people at the scene of the crime started 'reporting' what they had observed via social media. At around the same time, others in the vicinity were 'requesting' information about what was happening, as they had detected 'anomalous signals' in their environment, such as lots of police sirens and the air ambulance. As news of what had happened began to spread, many social media users communicated their emotional, cognitive and behavioural 'responses' to the news. Following on from which, others sought to employ social media to organise 'retaliatory' violence, to try and 'recruit' others to their ideologically motivated cause, and propagate 'rumours'. Later on in the reaction process, acts of 'remembering' became more important in the social media discourse, both in terms of the particular victim, but also allied incidents from the past. Some people used these collective memories to try and 'reheat' extant grievance narratives that connected the most recent crime, with previous atrocity events.
Importantly though, the analysis also identified that as well as being involved in the development of secondary problems and incidents, social media were also engaged in 'resiliencing' behaviours. These are instances where individuals, groups and communities engaged in counter-mobilisation collective actions in order to enact pro-social informal social control in response to anti-social risks and threats. In particular, two case studies of 'resiliencing' were developed through the analysis, showcasing how social media platforms are increasingly integral to this aspect of reacting to terrorism.
Importantly, there are suggestions within the data that there might be a degree of sequencing and patterning to these activities leading to the development of a sensitising concept of a 'reaction order'. Drawing an analogy with Erving Goffman's seminal concept of 'interaction order', this idea suggests that key elements of social reaction to major crimes may be organised around a set of common public sense-making rituals. Given that this was a rapid response mode grant and based upon a case study, further development and empirical testing of this concept is required. However, it is promising in terms of opening up new ways of studying processes of social reaction.
The second aspect to the findings focuses upon the study of conflict dynamics. Again, utilising the high resolution view that such data afford, they have been used to study how and why a number of secondary conflict events occurred following the killing of Fusilier Rigby. In the preliminary analysis of the dataset, it was identified that a number of conflict events involving far-right and left-wing / anti-fascist groups were being reported on. These were separated into discrete events and subject to more intensive study.
Adopting this approach has allowed us to empirically test some contemporary theories and hypotheses about the causes and consequences of violent conflict interactions. In particular, Randall Collins' (2012) work on the time dynamics of conflict has emerged as providing an especially relevant and interesting framework. Based upon limited data, Collins made a number of important claims and predictions about how violence evolves and unfolds at the micro-social level. We found that our data enabled an empirical test of some of these claims. The resulting findings suggest that whilst Collins' framework is broadly correct, there are important points of detail where the real social dynamics departed in important ways from what he hypothesised would happen.
Elements of these findings have been written up in two journal articles which are currently under review and a book chapter that has been accepted for publication. The two journal articles report the key empirical findings, and two further articles are in preparation developing the theoretical implications of these. The book chapter is scheduled for publication with Sage in their the Handbook of Online Research Methods, and as such, helps the project to deliver on its third aim of helping to shape and inform future strategies and agendas in terms of how social science responds to the challenges of 'big data'.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The methodological and substantive focus of the study has generated considerable interest from policy and practice facing potential users. This is evidenced by the fact that the research team have delivered eight invited presentations to national and international policy and practice conferences, with two further such engagements planned. These presentations have included speeches at a conference organized by the Dept. of Homeland Security in Washington DC.
The level of user interest is further reflected in the recent award from the Police Knowledge Fund run by the College of Policing, Home Office and HEFCE to establish the Open Source Communications Analytics Research (OSCAR) Development Centre. OSCAR involves a strategic partnership between the Cardiff research team, and the National Counter-Terrorism Functions Command, South Wales Police, West Midlands Police, Surrey Police, Sussex Police, Cardiff Council, and the London Borough of Sutton. The funding for the OSCAR Centre and the engagement of the range of partners involved, especially the Counter-Terrorism Command, is directly attributable to the level of interest generated in the approach and findings emanating from the 'After Woolwich' work.
At a policy level, there is ongoing interest in the implications of the findings for current approaches to counter-terrorism. Notably, it has been suggested that the cross-governmental CONTEST strategy, rather neglects the consequence management dimensions of community impacts following high profile violent incidents. Aspects of the analysis conducted provide an evidence base about what the content of a post-event strategy should attend to and how it should be delivered. 
Practitioner use of the findings has, in addition to the consequence management aspects outlined above, focused upon understanding the ways in which the kinds of analytic approaches applied during the study could develop more robust and rigorous methodologies for harnessing 'open source' information and intelligence.
The final group who will be able to take aspects of the work forward are the research community. Conceptually and methodologically the study has opened up new possibilities about how researchers can use social media data in new and interesting ways to develop unique insights into processes of social reaction. There has, after all, been a long-standing interest in how individuals and groups react to major crime events, as manifested in moral panic theory for example. What the analysis of social media affords is a far more fine-grained view of how different sections of the public react to such incidents and how their reactions evolve over an extended period of time. Thereby illuminating subtleties and nuances in these processes that were hitherto imperceptible.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>457C4C42-1E17-401D-8E4C-65DDA61042F8</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5644833e083766.96539031</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09546553.2016.1180289</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>416E603D-CF78-45B8-8F56-DF801E928802</gtr:id><gtr:title>Ten &amp;acirc;??Rs&amp;acirc;?? of social reaction: Using social media to analyse the &amp;acirc;??post-event&amp;acirc;?? impacts of the murder of Lee Rigby</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Terrorism and Political Violence</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ae2c78e2675c10a48809c27e5f305958"><gtr:id>ae2c78e2675c10a48809c27e5f305958</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Innes M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>585d5488afdcc7.67273200</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0B627BAB-55E8-45E5-A5B4-62B87084FFA8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Signal Crimes: Social Reactions to Crime, Disorder, and Control</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/fce3ac3a8c12985fe5849809bc6c270e"><gtr:id>fce3ac3a8c12985fe5849809bc6c270e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Innes</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780199684465</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>546284e51a23f7.78840293</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/L008181/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>CB259E50-E91D-4DCD-A395-BF252E8692B8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Criminology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
