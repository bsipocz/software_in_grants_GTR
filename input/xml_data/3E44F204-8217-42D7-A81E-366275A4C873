The project objectives are threefold:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>to examine a range of franchise models used by retailers across retail sectors for the purposes of international expansion and identify the model most likely to optimise retailer performance in emerging markets&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>to determine which features of Marks &amp;amp; Spencer?s franchise model contribute most to performance and under which circumstances&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>to compare the Marks &amp;amp; Spencer international franchise performance with their international market performance through other modes of operation (eg wholly owned subsidiary and joint venture).&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>The research will be conducted using face-to-face interviews with franchise store managers as well as a large-scale survey and analysis of company reports and other publically available information on international franchising. This research is important to retail competitiveness in the UK and has economic and societal implications overall. The findings of the research can potentially be applied across the whole international retail sector and ultimately improve international market performance for UK retailers. Following the conclusion of the study an open seminar for UK retailers will be held to share project insights.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will make an important contribution to knowledge by demonstrating how academic research in business schools can have high scholarly research impact, and be of value to business. Beneficiaries include: our partner company, its franchisees, suppliers and employees; other UK retailers, their suppliers and industry bodies; global retailing; and the academy. The project will contribute in three areas:

International Retailing
The UK economy is heavily reliant on services (including retailing) and the sector is important for UK international competitiveness. Building a global retail brand is challenging - the retail offer requires at least some adaptation for different markets/cultures. Also, modern retailing must be multi-channel - performance is linked to transparency between virtual and the physical store options across borders. Developing the optimum mix of channels and locations raises success in highly competitive global retailing. The research will contribute to knowledge of how best to deploy growth strategies (i.e., franchising) in multi-country retailing in order to build a successful global brand.

Understanding Emerging Markets
In the current economic climate, the focus of retail expansion has shifted from the Eurozone and North America to more distant emerging economics. These markets are inherently riskier and vastly different in terms of culture and business practices. However, many have demonstrated phenomenal growth in recent years and the business opportunities are well recognised. The research will contribute understanding on how best to approach these markets and in particular how to gain first mover advantage and maintain a rapid rate of expansion without exposure to a high level of risk. 

Franchising
The extent to which franchisees (or joint venture partners) in overseas markets are prepared to invest in and build the brand is a serious issue for retailers. Franchising is often central to international retail expansion as it allows for brand building with minimal cost/risk. But franchises can take many forms and the particular model used influences the actions of the franchisee. The research will show how franchising can be optimized to achieve the desired strategic objectives of the franchisor. Going further, comparisons will be made between different foreign market entry modes and their effects on performance. 

Academic Impact and Relevance
A problem for quantitative academic research is that the only readily available numerical data are highly aggregated, and do not capture business problems. Qualitative research has the task of making sense of processes within firms. This project will be an exemplar of methodological synergy. Qualitative insights will underpin not only survey data, but also the use of objective data. Commercial firms commonly under-exploit their own data but this can provide a wealth of knowledge that can be utilised by academic researchers. The lessons learned, methods and the findings of this research will be communicated through academic articles in world leading international journals in the area of international management, business and marketing. The PI and Co-I are frequent international conference presenters and will disseminate the findings at relevant conferences. The research is planned to have particular impact on new researchers, starting with the post doctoral research assistant under this project; as part of the capacity building stimulated by the research. The project will re-theorise and re-estimate franchising within the canon of international business modes, so addressing the unwarrantedly low academic attention customarily given to the mode. The research will contribute to academic understanding and knowledge of the role of franchising in international retail businesses, which is particularly important for understanding service sector internationalisation.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>153195</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Ideas in Practice Seminar Series (London)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7E34231A-794A-49EB-94CC-81631F0FADA7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The project team launched the Final Project Report at a London-based dissemination event at the inaugural session of the Business School's Ideas in Practice Seminar Series. This event was held at 11 Cavendish Square, London, and involved an audience of around 30 practitioners and academics.

These three conferences were selected with the view to disseminating the findings widely among different bodies of academics. Please note that the International Society of Franchising, in particular, is a conference that also involves many practitioners. The presentation talks sparked questions and discussion of the findings and their value to retailers and other firms.

The talk led to email and telephone exchanges with peers concerning projects that can take forward the findings of our franchising study. Such research could involve the present project's retail partner, Marks and Spencer.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5614eb425692c4.01281785</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Colloquium on European Research in Retailing 2014 (Bremen, Germany)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2214640D-6741-442B-A0CA-1B3FA30631D1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This presentation of the study's results at the CERR was to a mixed audience of retailing focused academics and practitioners. The CERR is a grouping that aims to provide managerial and scientific insights. It specialises in highly applied research and presentations are delivered by both academics and retail practitioners. The talk stimulated thinking on reasons for the perceived lack of international research on franchising despite its attractiveness to retailers as a low risk model for expanding overseas. The theme of the colloquium was retailing in post-crisis Europe and there was recognition that many attractive retailing opportunities are away from Europe.

The talk led to email and telephone exchanges with peers concerning the need to identify non-English research on international franchising and to pursue cross-border retailing research generally.

The topic of the seminar was From Leeds to Limassol: Innovations in International Business Models. The first part of the seminar was delivered by the PI, with Gobind taking over in the second half. The PI concentrated on franchising, while Gobind spoke more generally about internationalisation and use of e-commerce to that end. The final part of the seminar involved a question and answer session that addressed points the audience found particularly interesting.

After this talk I was approached by a number of practitioners who were interested in seeing more of my findings. We made arrangements to this end. Further, these discussions led to a connection with Eversheds, which is a law firm that specialises in helping retailers go international. The connection to Eversheds proved hugely important in terms of boosting the reach of the research--it led to the PI's involvement in their Annual Retail Conference.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>565b5c75aef721.88031594</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.leeds.ac.uk/info/3000/working_with_business/186/strategic_partnerships/5</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Further dissemination of findings (Marks and Spencer headquarters, London)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CFAA0AD7-EC2F-4527-9EFD-C6D38580439D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Building upon the earlier presentation of interim findings, a more detailed report of the study findings was presented and discussed. Steven Finlan, the former Director of International Operations, left M&amp;amp;S in November 2014. His replacement, Mark Koprowski (Regional Director) and his team, requested a presentation in August, 2015, that covered previous updates and results but also new findings. The role of this discussion was also to inform an allied consultancy project conducted by Javelin on how to improve the M&amp;amp;S franchising model. Essentially Javelin were instructed to pick up on our key findings in order to help make changes to the M&amp;amp;S franchising model. To this end, there was a subsequent telephone meeting with Alice Cowley (Associate Director, Javelin) on how to take forward some of the study findings.

The August meeting at M&amp;amp;S headquarters fed into work by Javelin to implement certain of our study findings and, thus, had a direct impact on the M&amp;amp;S franchising model.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5614de4083c6c5.45369621</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>British Business Group Conference - Connect 2014 (Delhi, India)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C7A455B0-F347-4345-AB32-FCA028F98D86</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The BBG annual conference is an industry-focused conference that aims to consolidate relationships between British and Indian organisations across industries.

I delivered a keynote on the partnership between Marks and Spencer and our School and the evolution of the focal research study, which fed into a subsequent panel question and answer session in which I also took part.

After my talk, there have been email exchanges and telephone conversations with practitioners from a range of organisations concerning taking the present research forward into the Indian context.

As well as raising insight into international franchising, these talks stimulated at least one of the students (Ross Baxter, an undergraduate student) to conduct a summer dissertation on the brand effects of M&amp;amp;S international franchising.

Thus far, they include the following:

? Members of the research team presented the study findings on two separate occasions to a total of six senior managers at the corporate HQ of the Retailer. The Retailer has also been handed several written reports. Further, the findings have been discussed with one senior executive of a global consultancy the Retailer is using to inform its international expansion. Our findings have fed into the work of this consultancy and driven change at the Retailer.

? The PI co-presented study findings alongside a senior regional manager of the Retailer at a high-profile seminar series run jointly by the University of Leeds and the Retailer. This Leeds-based seminar involved presenting to a mixed audience of over 100 managers, students, and alumni.

? The PI sat on an expert panel at the Eversheds Annual Retail Conference, in London, for their International Expansion Planning Workshop. The workshop covered current trends and challenges facing retailers, including international franchising-drawing on the findings of the study. This conference involved just over 100 delegates spanning the vast majority of large retailers operating on the UK high street.

? Members of the research team presented papers based on the study findings at five major conferences: the European Marketing Academy Conference; European Association in Education and Research in Commercial Distribution Conference; International Society of Franchising Conference; Colloquium on European Research in Retailing Conference; and British Business Group India Conference. Not only do these conferences span different subject foci (e.g., marketing, retailing, franchising, and international business), but also they vary in their audience make-up (e.g., academics and/or practitioners).

? Members of the research team presented the study findings at an internal Impact and Engagement Seminar Series that is organised through Leeds University Business Schools' Connections team and Professional Services Hub. This seminar will be repeated to an external audience, consisting of retail practitioners. The Retailer and Eversheds have committed senior staff to supporting this event, which is to take place in London.

? The PI disseminated findings of the study in research-led teaching to in excess of 300 students at the postgraduate and undergraduate levels. This led to the development of an undergraduate student's summer project focusing on the Retailer's franchising model and involving new interviews with their staff (facilitated by the PI).

? A paper was submitted to the Chartered Management Institute Top Management Articles of the Year Competition. Scholarly articles targeting top management journals are in the process of being developed.

? A detailed industry report that furnishes UK retailers with insights into how to set up and manage franchising partnerships with overseas retailers has been made available online (e.g., http://business.leeds.ac.uk/research-and-innovation/blog/article/best-in-class-international-franchising-report-for-the-uk-retail-sector/). The launch of the report, which was signposted in an article in the Yorkshire Post, has led to discussions between the PI and a number of retailers, legal firms, and consultancies. Indeed, we have observed that the use of well-connected intermediaries is an efficacious route to senior managers of internationally expanding retailers.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>D659C09E-F093-4D17-9BA3-9875AAF966FF</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>546225b6d32242.25796436</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Retail</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The study has discovered the following in line with the study objectives: 

The optimal model of international franchising is heavily reliant on interdependent partnerships. Unlike traditional franchising partnerships, where the franchisor is in control and intensively monitors across its network of franchisees, international franchising is best developed through using a capable overseas area development partner. The differences between emerging markets and the UK can be so extreme that it is difficult for the franchisor to control operations, irrespective of their resource base and experience. In effect, the franchisor is reliant on the franchisee to make and implement decisions in the local marketplace and absorb local risks. The overseas franchisees can effectively build the brand with the franchisor in a form of strategic alliance-both sides learn to cooperate over time to this end. Our findings contribute to the first stage of international area development franchising relationship theory development, but also contribute new insights to theory on strategic alliances.

Key to the performance of overseas franchising is the role of the overseas franchisees in interpreting local market conditions and enabling the franchisor to respond to these. For instance, in emerging market settings the consumer can be more aspirational than in the UK and represent a younger demographic profile. The ability to localize marketing (e.g., products and prices), however, can be undermined not only by the franchising model applied (e.g., levels of franchisor control and operational support), but also by the design of the UK retailer's business. More specifically, the franchisees we studied were especially critical of logistics and supply chain and buying and merchandising arrangements, which undermine franchisee responsiveness to local market conditions. These areas of the retail business can put domestic retailing first, which adds to the difficulty of resolving the issues.

The franchising model is not as profitable vis-&amp;agrave;-vis other modes of foreign market entry. However, it is optimal in its ability to accommodate head-winds in risky overseas markets. Marks and Spencer use franchising to remain profitable in Russia and the Ukraine, despite the socio-political tensions in these territories over the past twelve months. The risk of lost sales due to recession is also borne by the franchisee; though Marks and Spencer will take returns of bought and paid for goods under such exceptional circumstances. Where the franchising model has an issue is in internet related expansion, which is far easier if the UK retailer is using a form of ownership overseas (e.g., a joint venture). For instance, Greek Marks and Spencer customers can shop through the internet, whilst this option is not feasible for Cypriots. In sum, the performance of different modes of foreign market entry is highly circumstantial. Franchising should though be playing an important role in overseas retailing operations due to its flexibility and ability to absorb head-winds. UK retailers can derive advantages from using a network of franchising operations (e.g., in emerging markets) as the basis upon which to expand into other, higher-profit modes as and when local circumstances dictate this.

This said, it is expected the findings will be of most value to those seeking to investigate research questions and/or develop retail policy across the areas.

Although dissemination is an on-going activity and involves a number of firms, Marks and Spencer have already fed back on the quality of our findings in various meetings and telephone discussions, and they have begun to implement changes to their franchising model based on some of our findings (e.g., they are changing their pricing model to better localise this aspect of their international marketing). 

The most recent dissemination event - the Ideas of Practice Seminar - co-delivered with Marks and Spencer in January 2016, involved Duncan Tennent, their Regional General Merchandise Sales Manager for the Middle East and North Africa. Indeed, the purpose of this event was to open up the findings to other major retailers (e.g., Boots), and to third parties (e.g., law firms such as Eversheds) using the findings in their consultations on international retailing models. 

The project team has widely disseminated the findings to different academic and practitioner conference audiences, to interested parties using social media and blogs, and using the Business Press. Our recent success in receiving the Leeds University Business School Research Impact Award will spur further dissemination and engagement activities.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A29250AD-CCD6-43FE-A936-153CBD71B55C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54621fa3216826.62753043</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Retail</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://business.leeds.ac.uk/research-and-innovation/blog/article/best-in-class-international-franchising-report-for-the-uk-retail-sector/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The database for the study comprises rich qualitative data from over 60 interviews across five countries (so far).

In sum, the data collected will be most comprehensive and scrutinise many aspects of international franchising relationships in emerging markets.</gtr:description><gtr:id>663B2CB0-8E5D-48E1-94F3-62E203C149DB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>There has not yet been direct impact from the data themselves, though the data have generated considerable interest at the conferences and dissemination events we have attended thus far. The general sense is that the present data is broader, deeper and more analytical than data used in previous international franchising research.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>546208fea13d56.08418600</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Emerging market franchising data</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C24450A2-8311-440B-9E59-F1550F7344E2</gtr:id><gtr:title>Advances in Global Marketing</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9943acbb0e076526413b047d5258fdd5"><gtr:id>9943acbb0e076526413b047d5258fdd5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Robson M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5aa2665cf2a9d6.72352169</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1FA02F65-04FB-49B5-80CD-EC475775D06E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Retailers could look to franchise model to expand around globe</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/25bfe527605e93ebbbf5ea498180c111"><gtr:id>25bfe527605e93ebbbf5ea498180c111</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Robson, M.J.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56d458a5f35060.28127131</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9FA954B3-AADD-4DC5-B4A3-16578EDA329D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Best In Class International Franchising</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/25bfe527605e93ebbbf5ea498180c111"><gtr:id>25bfe527605e93ebbbf5ea498180c111</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Robson, M.J.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56d44cfd0a3b79.11594452</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>09F7EB5A-54E8-48AA-AB68-BB034ED638AC</gtr:id><gtr:title>ESRC Retail Sector Initiative publication on the British Library Portal</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/b4709196fa029514ab37d2015c382a0a"><gtr:id>b4709196fa029514ab37d2015c382a0a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Robson, M.J., Watson, K., Kadile, V. and Clegg, L.J.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:outcomeId>56d44b68e0eab0.61835063</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/L005212/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FF250DD2-C462-4948-B00D-7356830D455B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>International Business</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>73304753-7B2F-432F-BACE-578EEECC772A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Marketing</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F2374716-F4F8-4797-AF86-2D2436C2C14E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Retail Management</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
