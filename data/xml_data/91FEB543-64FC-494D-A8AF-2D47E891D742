The aim of the project is to extend our discussion to include those involved with advising on and making public policy in relation to the public realm of the contemporary street. \n\nToday the street is often synonymous with anxiety, worry, and anti-social behaviour: nothing of this is new. The opposite is also true, however, as urban renewal, major infrastructure and monumental architectural projects are invested by planners and policy-makers with the expectation that they will redeem depressed areas and renew the social and physical fabric of neighbourhoods and communities: again, this also applies to the past. Led by historians who are specialists on the cities, architecture, and social life of Europe in the fifteenth to seventeenth centuries, the Street Life and Street Culture network over the two years of its existence has brought together those who work on and are involved in the life of historic and contemporary cities and streets. To date, the Street Life and Street Culture network has involved architectural and art historians and theoreticians, historians, planners, public officials, artists and critics, film-makers, a sound artist and an actor, to create an interdisciplinary, international community drawn from the UK, USA and Europe. The aim has been to create a fruitful dialogue with multiple voices that will allow all of us to view the lives of cities, as witnessed along streets, through comparative perspectives. \n\nThe Street Life and Street Culture network seeks to understand the broader issues concerning the street as a place of cultural mediation and the construction of identities by comparing perspectives and methodologies from different disciplines, and confronting and comparing Early Modern experiences with our contemporary world as a means of throwing new light on issues. The street is a result of the urban process, a continuously reinforced dynamic between private and public spheres and the negotiation of public, social, and private identities. The built fabric of the street - not just a road along which people speed but a physical and social space created by the buildings that front onto it - forms an essential place for everyday social interaction, as well as a possible setting for spectacular events. The social relationships and the events that take place in the space of the street give particular meanings and resonances - temporary, local, national, or historical - to an individual street as well as to a city as a whole.\n\nThe network has sought an historical understanding of contemporary problems concerning street culture by addressing issues that may also help reframe current issues, thus feeding into public policy. This objective has been advanced by the network's varied constituencies and the involvement of our original project partners, CABE (Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment). The primary aim of this bid is to take the network one step further, to engage directly with policy/practice participants and thus to take the discussion we have initiated to a different level. In so doing, we seek again to show the value and significance of historical precedents from the Early Modern period for the debates that deal with contemporary concerns pertaining to the form and use of the public urban space of streets.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The Street Life network has already had a positive impact in relation to academics, contemporary practitioners, and the public audiences of its workshops and conference. This bid is intended to allow the PI and CI to continue that work by moving the network forward to engage directly with those working in the area of advising on and making public policy. We have already invited and secured expressions of interest from the following national charities and advisory bodies:\n- The Joseph Rowntree Foundation: in particular in relation to their 'Place' programme, which is concerned with 'contributing to the building and development of strong, sustainable and inclusive communities'. \n- The Prince's Foundation, who are much concerned with both 'the design of buildings and the public realm'.\n- Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA): in relation to the Policy and Public Affairs team and RIBA London's Street Scene, which looks at the quality of everyday streets and public spaces and the delivery of such objectives.\n- The Young Foundation: in particular in relation to their 'Future Communities' programme, which is concerned with 'designing new places for communities and housing that are socially sustainable'.\nWe intend to initiate and develop further contacts and involvement with professional bodies as well as local and national government, and policing bodies if our bid is successful. \n\nBy bringing a broad range of interlocutors to our events, we aim to inflect policy with the cross-cultural and cross-chronological breadth that has characterised the work of the network to date. We will bring key figures from these organisations together with selected historians, commentators and practitioners concerned with the contemporary city who have already participated in the Streetlife network; this variety of perspectives will enrich our discussion and extend its impact considerably. \n\nOur programme is designed so that the first phase will enable us to identify the most promising lines for collaboration and research in a closed context, and then the workshops will enable presentation and discussion of ideas and issues within a collaborative and supportive framework but accessible to a small public audience. The partnership of HEI (PI and CI, as well as existing network participants) and various high profile advisory and public bodies will facilitate media engagement and presentation to a broader public. We hope also to be able to benefit from the support of AHRC's own media office to promote our activity. \n\nThe intention of this proposed extension of the network's activities is, therefore, not to limit discussions to the academic realm but to enable the network's activities to impact on the discussion of public policy. Such discussionsare at the heart of current and future concerns and debates on the lives of communities and public spaces, and are given added relevance by the government's desire to build the 'Big Society'.\n\nThe existing network website, hosted at the University of Bath, will continue to be used (and enhanced) to provide both a public-facing account of our activity and findings, and a 'closed' site for participants to advance discussion and produce and share documents which can later be published in the public part of the site (Archive). Moreover, we envisage that the website will provide an ideal forum for the publication of the continuing work of the network, with the publication of reports, research papers and sound and video recordings of some of our events.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-03-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-02-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>24154</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>100000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Taverns, locals and street corners: cross-chronological studies in community drinking, regulation and public space</gtr:description><gtr:end>2013-02-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council (AHRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>AH/J006610/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>C8F0DC10-9563-4777-AF4F-414751DE7112</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-9903380488.88685206a46230</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-02-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>100000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Taverns, locals and street corners: cross-chronological studies in community drinking, regulation and public space</gtr:description><gtr:end>2013-02-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council (AHRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>AH/J006610/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>72F624DA-D9ED-4986-AC7A-FBF04D86E7FD</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5ec9ce8c5ec9cea0</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-02-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The Street life and street culture network (AH/G000417/1) has set out to build an international team of scholars with shared research interests in the interdisciplinary study of urban culture; in particular the relationship between the built environment and the social fabric of Early Modern and contemporary cities. The result has been a dynamic discourse between specialists from historical and non-historical disciplines that has linked the historic past to the present. Indeed, since the public urban life of the pre-Modern Mediterranean world has frequently been held up as a model for the socially engaged, publicly-staged idea of community, we have also aimed to test the potential for such cross-chronological comparisons. While textual evidence is a crucial tool for the historian, the environment of the street (visual, aural, theatrical, architectural, political) is the principal object of our study, and as such is 'beyond text'.



A focus of activities for the original network (2008-11) was to consolidate a core research group, accomplished through a series of events over a period of 2 years, details of which can be found on the network website (www.bath.ac.uk/ace/Streetlife/). The primary aim of the follow-on-funding phase of the network was to go one step further, to engage directly with policy/practice participants and thus to take the discussion we have initiated to a different audience. In so doing, we set out again to show the value and significance of historical precedents from the Early Modern period for the debates that deal with contemporary concerns pertaining to the form and use of the public urban space of streets.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The follow-on-funding was for continuation of network activity, and as such the aim was to extend the range of our participant base and engage directly with policy/practice participants. We have achieved this successfully, bringing in participants from town planning design and policymaking, think tanks, public bodies, the police force and related policy research agencies, charitable foundations and trusts involved in research, policy and practice pertaining to public space.

Possibility of developing this theme further has recently emerged in the new HERA call for which i am considering an application.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>BEC2E174-3910-4194-810A-79F66AB4DA56</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-8708765123.699574775b25d6</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.bath.ac.uk/ace/Streetlife/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>DD5039EC-1A3E-4DA4-BEA4-54521771F158</gtr:id><gtr:title>Surveillance and Control of the Street in Renaissance Italy</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>I Tatti Studies in the Italian Renaissance</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/26186579aabaf6b3bd4fee75bd0ecbe4"><gtr:id>26186579aabaf6b3bd4fee75bd0ecbe4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Nevola F</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545e62133521f1.60246937</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E32378C7-116E-4D25-A66C-EA9F6CC5DEAF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Review Essay: Street Life in Early Modern Europe</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Renaissance Quarterly</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/26186579aabaf6b3bd4fee75bd0ecbe4"><gtr:id>26186579aabaf6b3bd4fee75bd0ecbe4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Nevola F</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545e62da412181.28402442</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2C9E8698-BBDF-4EE6-A8DD-0DFB5030B1AA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Introduction: The Experience of the Street in Early Modern Italy</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>I Tatti Studies in the Italian Renaissance</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f5449c75a7c65184fda831375ad8cfbb"><gtr:id>f5449c75a7c65184fda831375ad8cfbb</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Clarke G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>545e62135b3e51.70708725</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I026022/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>608431EA-925E-44D8-A1E2-8C24B4768085</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7A76A7D6-69D8-433D-A35F-0360BC814DC2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Architecture HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
