When choosing between competing accounts of the same phenomena, they have traditionally relied on the principle of economy. General solutions are nearly always preferred to more specific ones, and it is assumed that any regularities that can be captured by means of general rules and principles should be so captured. Many linguists also believe that anything that is computable need not be, and hence is not, stored.\n\nHowever, it is doubtful that the principle of economy is an appropriate standard by which to evaluate linguistic theories, if these are intended to be psychologically realistic. Human brains are very slow processors, but have enormous storage capacity. From a psychological point of view, therefore, storage is the preferred strategy. It is easier to retrieve a complex form than to compute it; consequently, speakers tend to rely on prefabricated chunks and low-level generalisations whenever possible. \nThis project explores the tension between linguists' grammars and speakers' mental grammars, focussing on one particular construction, questions with 'long distance dependencies' (LDDs) such as (1): \n\n(1) What do you think the boy will really like?\n\nIn (1), the logical object of 'like', 'what', occurs at the beginning of the main clause rather than in the normal direct object position (i.e. after 'like'). I will explore how such questions are produced and understood, and what implications this has for linguistic theories. \n\nAccording to the traditional account of such structures, speakers first produce a sentence with the WH-word (i.e. 'what') in the logical position, then move the WH-word to the beginning of the sentence and add 'do'. Importantly, both the rules which build the original or 'deep' structure and the rules that modify it are very general, in that they apply to all kinds of questions as well as other sentence types. \n\nAn alternative account of this phenomenon begins with the observation that the vast majority of 'real life' LDD questions consist of a WH-word followed by the auxiliary 'do', the pronoun 'you', and the verb 'think'. This fact can be captured in a partially schematic templates such as\n\n(2) [WH-word] + do you think + [S-gap], \n\nwhere S-gap is a sentence with a gap or missing constituent. Speakers can then use this template to produce new LDD questions by inserting material of the right kind in the slots indicated by square brackets in (2). Thus, to produce (1), the speaker would insert 'what' in the WH-word slot and 'the boy will really like' in the S-gap. Speakers can also modify the template if they want to ask a slightly different question. For example, if they want to inquire about future hopes rather than present beliefs, they will need to substitute 'will' for 'do' and 'hope' for 'think' in the template, as well as inserting the WH-word and the sentence with the gap: \n\n(3) What will you hope the boy will really like? \n\nIf this account is correct, then prototypical LDD questions such as (1) should be easier to produce than unprototypical questions such as (3), in spite of the fact that linguists generally regard them as instances of the same construction. Thus, the usage-based account predicts that prototypical LDD questions will be produced more fluently than non-prototypical questions and judged as more natural than non-prototypical questions; but there should be no analogous effect for the corresponding declaratives like (4) and (5): these should be equally easy to produce. \n\n(4) You think the boy will really like it.\n(5) You will hope the boy will really like it.\n\nThe proposed research will test these predictions using data from spoken corpora and acceptability judgment experiments. The results will add to our understanding of how people process language and how children acquire it, as well as contributing to the development of empirical methods in linguistics.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>26926</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/F001924/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>B94A2498-60DA-4055-A957-686B6CB42654</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Linguistics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>29000EBB-2E17-48B1-A0F8-87862EF36D2B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Linguistic Theory</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
