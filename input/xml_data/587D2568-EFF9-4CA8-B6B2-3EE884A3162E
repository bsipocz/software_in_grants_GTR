IBM estimates that 2.5 quintillion of digital data bytes are produced every day on Earth (2.5 x 1018 bytes = 2.5 Exabytes = 2.5 billion Gigabytes). This huge digital data storage demand has two consequences: 

a) the increased power consumption of data storage servers; 
b) the perpetual need to develop data storage technologies that meet the increasing demand at reduced cost and power consumption. 

These issues have prompted the acceleration of research into solid-state memories, which are fast replacing traditional magnetic hard disc drives in almost all consumer electronics and portable devices. 

In Dec. 2016 and Jan. 2017, the principal investigator (PI) of this travel grant and his co-investigator from Iowa State University, proposed and demonstrated, for the first time, a novel solid-state memory effect in bulk anti-ferroelectric ceramic materials [1-3]. Although this is a very promising discovery, the authors pointed out a few issues that required further investigation, including a relaxation process that significantly limited the signal recovered from a memory cell. In addition, it was acknowledged that the effect was observed in bulk anti-ferroelectric materials, while solid-state memory chips are based on thin films. 

This modest EPSRC overseas travel grant (&amp;lt; &amp;pound;15k), seeks to swiftly redress these issues by facilitating five weeks travel to three overseas institutions, in two countries, in order to perform specialized experiments on anti-ferroelectric materials and to acquire key skills that will advance our understanding of anti-ferroelectric materials and potentially accelerate the commercialization of this research. By working with leading researchers in the field of data storage technologies at Western Digital (WD) - California, physics of anti-ferroelectric materials at Iowa State University (ISU) and experts in Mossbauer Spectroscopy at the National Institute of Materials Pysics (NIMP) in Bucharest, the PI will have the opportunity to study relaxation processes and memory effect in anti-ferroelectric thin films. In addition, the PI will acquire valuable new experimental skills such as: fabrication of anti-ferroelectric materials and their domains imaging using in-situ Transmission Electron Microscopy (ISU), device architecture / solid state memory cell testing (WD) and Mossbauer Spectroscopy (NIMP). This is an excellent value for money low-risk / high-gain EPSRC travel grant, with huge potential for academic, societal and economic impacts.

The effect is already confirmed in bulk anti-ferroelectrics, and the PI seeks to expand his research into thin films. 

The confirmation of a 4-state memory effect in anti-ferroelectric thin films is a paradigm shift in non-volatile solid-state memories. The proposed new RAM memory device, AFRAM, does not exist at present and it will combine the device architecture of existing FRAM to create a novel 4-state non-volatile memory. The successful implementation of AFRAM potentially will have huge economic and societal impact. 

In particular, the success of the project has the potential to impact the whole UK advanced manufacturing economy and the Global multi-billion $ non-volatile memory chips industry. FRAM chips have been mass produced since 1995 by Fujitsu. So far 10 billion FRAM chips have been commercialized globally and the demand is projected to increase significantly. The economic and societal impacts of potentially replacing FRAM with AFRAM are therefore huge. Companies with a strong portfolio of data storage technologies such as Fujitsu, Toshiba, and Seagate have a well-established presence in the UK with thousands of jobs in production and R&amp;amp;D, and they would be immediate beneficiaries of this research. 

To maximize the industrial impact, the PI has already established industrial links with Western Digital, a global data storage company based in California. The importance of solid state memories is best emphasised by the recent diversification of Western Digital from traditional magnetic hard disc drive storage to solid state memories by acquiring SanDisk Corporation. Under this EPSRC travel grant, the PI will meet the R&amp;amp;D solid state memory team at Western Digital to discuss the new AFRAM technology. The PI has already been invited to deliver, during his visit, one lecture at Western Digital and one lecture at the IEEE Magnetics Society Chapter in San Jose, California. 

The project has also an environmental impact dimension as it can facilitate the introduction of more energy efficient AFRAM memory chips that retain the benefits of FRAM, but require 100x less power in comparison to competitor technologies. This is especially of importance to portable electronics where battery life time is essential. 

Besides the clear academic impacts detailed in a separate section, the strongest points of this project are its potential economic, societal and environmental impacts with key beneficiaries in high-tech industry, data storage, advanced manufacturing and development of scientific measurements. EPSRC funding of this modest grant is therefore low-risk / high-gain.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-01-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-07-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>11686</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R028656/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
