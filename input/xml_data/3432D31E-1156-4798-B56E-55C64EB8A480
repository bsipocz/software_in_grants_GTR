The fundamental science such as the physical properties of the interfaces between diamond and piezoelectric material, resonant properties of the diamond MEMS cantilevers, and the basic device properties of the MPIS will be investigated. The target is to achieve a high strain factor of 100 (100 times of metal gauge, 10 times of silicon piezoresistance at Room Temperature) and high-temperature (&amp;gt;400oC) pressure sensing.

The advent of a new generation of high temperature pressure sensor based on diamond for harsh environments would be of benefit immediately to major UK industrial players, such as British aerospace (Rolls Royce plc), automotive (MG motors, BMW engine plant in Birmingham), power generating (especially nuclear power station, as diamond is a radiation hard material), oil, space and semiconductor devices sectors (Element Six Ltd, CamSemi). The devices and sensors will have applications outside the MEMS field. Subsequent beneficiaries would be global industries including optical coatings, tribology, electrochemical electrodes (when doped with boron), heat spreading, batteries, photonics, metrology and sensors, etc.

The project will have the potential to contribute to current and future UK economic success. The engineering sector makes up nearly a fifth of the UK economy (19.6% of GDP) and employs over 4.5 million people [1]. Within this, the electronics industry directly contributes in excess of &amp;pound;16 billion to the UK GDP and provides direct employment for over 300,000 people in 12,000 companies [2]. Electronic Devices and Sensors contribute significantly to this, and have an indirect economic impact many times this size through an infrastructure of suppliers and dependent trades.

The project is within EPSRC priority area: Manufacturing the Future theme. The project has a clear application and has a great potential to move into the next phase of diamond device generation and ultimately commercialization. Diamond based pressure sensors are expected to operate at elevated temperatures in harsh environments, with high sensitivity, and stability and reliability. It could replace silicon-based devices one day. The society will benefit from the prolonged lifetime and much improved reliability of diamond devices. Furthermore, diamond based devices are radiation hard, which means they can also be used in radioactive environments such as monitoring the leakae in nuclear power plants, potentially avoiding accidents.

HOW WILL THEY BENEFIT

Academic and public sector scientists will also benefit from both generic and specific technical developments underpinned by fundamental insight into diamond technology associated with ferroelectronics and MEMs technology. These observations on electronic and physical properties of the fabricated sensors from this project will allow the development of alternatives to silicon-based MEMs sensors. In addition, this work will contribute to both local government-supported initiatives in Biomaterials and Sensor Development alongside opportunities for development of nanodiamond materials on the European and Global stage.

WHAT WILL BE DONE TO ENSURE THEY BENEFIT

Academic communication and publication of the research outputs will focus on a high impact international conference and peer-reviewed journals to enable academic, industrial, and public sector scientists to rapidly benefit. Dissemination of the research findings will be carried out using UK's based Knowledge Transfer Networks (KTN), and via seminars and lectures gives at professional societies such as Institutes of Physics, Engineering &amp;amp; Technology, Nanotechnology. 

Monthly video conferences and yearly meetings with the Visiting Researcher will enable progress to be reviewed and opportunities for rapid development of IP to be taken. The broader scientific impact of the innovation within this project requires the development of a detailed Exploitation Plan covering several areas and approaches. This will be carried out through consultation with local government and Aston's TTO enabling protection of developing and know-how.

Key findings are:

(1) Piezoelectric thin films can be preferentially grown on silicon or diamond substrates by using ZnO buffer layer.
(2) Diamond based MOS structures are important components of the field effect transistors. Impedance spectroscopy has been used to characterize the diamond based MOS structures, which resulted in more reliable physical parameters extraction and understanding than conventional capacitance-voltage measurements.
(3) Impedance spectroscopy is found to be a powerful tool to provide an effective strategy to obtain not only the equivalent circuit but also the capacitance of the MOS structure, which will provide useful guidance to modulate the overall device performance.
(4) The diamond field-effect transistor based on the high-k oxide materials was demonstrated. The capacitance density of the metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) was very high which is contributed from both the high-k value and the very thin thickness of the oxide layer. The utilization of the high-k gate material brought forward the features of an improved drain current at low gate voltages.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Part of the research finding has been used to form a new consortium funded by EPSRC e-future platform.
