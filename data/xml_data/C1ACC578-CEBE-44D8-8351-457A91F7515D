Have you ever had a more serious infectious disease? Have you ever used a computer? Have you ever thought of combining the two? The use of computers to fight infectious disease may seem far fetched, but we can now realise this dream through immunoinformatics, a profound and exciting new computational science able to greatly accelerate the speed and effectiveness of vaccine discovery. Vaccines are microscopic entities that can, in effect, mimic infectious organisms so that such microbes can later be recognised and harmlessly destroyed by the human body during subsequent infection. Based on sound, experimental data we can use statistical methods to identify, in the computer, tiny bits of pathogenic micro-organisms / bacteria, virus, parasites, or fungi / which the immune system can recognise, tagging invading microbes for destruction. In order to realise the power of these advances will require much effort, however. The problem we face has made components, not least the multitudinous ways that the immune system uses to sense and recognise micro-organisms. We wish to investigate one specific part of the immune system, a single protein, called HLA-Cw 0102, and use cutting-edge technology, include isothermal titration calorimetry, to investigate how it recognises tiny fragments of invading bacteria and viruses. Using the information we gain from doing so, will enable us, hopefully, to develop new and improved potential vaccines for the prevention of a whole range of disease from AIDS to the common cold.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Mass vaccination, which takes account of herd immunity, is considered the most efficacious prophylactic control of infection. Historically, vaccines have been attenuated whole pathogens, but antigen and epitope vaccines are now commonly available. There is an increasing effort to determine and predict T cell epitopes, which requires the detailed analysis of how MHCs interact with peptides. T cell epitopes are short peptides which are bound by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules and subsequently recognised by T cells. By effectively short-cutting the vaccine discovery process, such immunoinformatic tools allow us to capitalise on the wealth of pathogen genomes now available. Principal amongst immunoinformatic tools are automated methods for the identification of epitopes in silico without the need for labour-intensive, time-consuming, and expensive large-scale in vitro assays. Our objective is to develop new in silico tools which can accelerate the pace of vaccine discovery through the rapid identification of such epitopes. There is an initial need to better characterise the peptide specificity of under-explored HLA C alleles, and we aim to use several complimentary, yet synergistic techniques - cell surface stabilisation, ELISA, and isothermal titration calorimetry - to address this problem, focusing initially on the allele HLA-CW 0102. We will also obtain crystal structures for this alleles bound to a number of different peptides, and ultimately derive robust, multivariate statistical tools for predicting its peptide binding affinity, a necessary prerequisite for epitope discovery within emergent genomic information on pathogens.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-01-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-01-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>231646</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>E0F24318-703F-4DF0-92DD-877941BB9B6A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Integrating in silico and in vitro analysis of peptide binding affinity to HLA-Cw*0102: a bioinformatic approach to the prediction of new epitopes.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>PloS one</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/c13db73b9fa8146e8292efc105f9cf08"><gtr:id>c13db73b9fa8146e8292efc105f9cf08</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Walshe VA</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1932-6203</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>56758cd42a69b</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/D004020/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
