transcription factors to cancer</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>G0700763</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This study aims to identify novel molecular mechanisms by which TCF4 and beta-catenin genes control intestinal stem cells and how changes in the properties of these genes may lead to the development of bowel cancer.

The intestine represents an easily accessible developmental system which provides an attractive route to model biologically important intestinal processes such as; embryogenesis, tumorigenesis and stem cell biology. It also provides a unique opportunity for the direct identification and analysis of factors that contribute to development of both normal and tumour tissue.
 
The transcription factor, TCF4, has been shown to be critical for intestinal stem cell phenotype but how plasticity and self-renewal is regulated by TCF4 is poorly understood. Therefore, in vivo models of mouse gut-tissue-specific depletion of TCF4 on the APCMin, a mouse model of colon cancer background will be studied.

An in-depth understanding of the mechanisms that control differentiation of distinct cell lineages during normal development and cancer intestinal epithelial stem cells by Wnt/beta-catenin signalling, may lead to identification of novel therapeutic targets. 

Given that beta-catenin signalling is deregulated in several different types of cancer, this may also lead to greater understanding of these tumours and of carcinogenesis in general.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>While the biological roles of canonical Wnt/b-catenin signalling in development and malignant evolution are well documented, understanding the molecular logic underlying these functionally distinct nuclear transcriptional programs remains a major challenge. Many proteins are associated with cytoplasmic b-catenin for regulation of Wnt/-catenin pathway activities, but the Lef/TCF family of transcription factors remain the sole focus as unambiguous DNA binding partners. However, in addition to Tcf/Lefs, the interaction of b-catenin with several other transcriptional co-regulators may be required for gene expression distinct patterns engage in development versus a malignant evolution. 
Hypothesis 
Developmentally important homeodomain transcription factors linked to b-catenin, which contribute to intestinal epithelial stem cell maintenance in the context of normal b-catenin status, are de-regulated in the transition to intestinal cancer stem cells.
Goals 
1) To define how the vast and constantly varying spectrum of b-catenin protein-modifications is interpreted to produce alterations in cellular-phenotype.
2) To examine the functionally distinct actions of the TCF4 in response to b-catenin during the generation of diverse cell types from pluripotent precursors during development and carcinogenesis.
3) Characterisation any additional transcriptional strategies independent to and/or competitor to the TCF4:b-catenin to achieve the pleiotropic effects of the Wnt/b-catenin-signalling pathway. 
Objectives and research plans
1) The yeast Ras recruitment system, already established by the applicant (2) will be carried out to isolate new-cofactors that bind to phosphorylated and/or un-phosphorylated b-catenin (Fig 1A). We speculate that this information could be shared with normal proliferating crypt cells including the IES cells and shared and distinct cofactors will be identified.
2) Stem cells are a pluripotent, self-renewing cell type that give rise to differentiated cells. To the stem cell fate determination in vivo, we intend to develop a novel in vivo model of mouse transgenic line in which the expression of H2B-GFP is controlled by a specific mouse intestinal stem cell marker, Musashi-1 promoter [Pmsi] (5,6) and with the gut-conditional villin-Cre mediated-recombination (Fig 1B).
3) The transcription factor, TCF4, a key feature of IES cells but how pluripotency and self-renewal is co-regulated by both TCF4 and b-Catenin is poorly understood. Therefore, in vivo models of conditional knockout of TCF4 (loss of function) and APCMin a gain of constitutive activation of b-catenin are proposed (Fig 1C).
4) Whether additional transcriptional strategies are required of the Wnt/b-catenin signalling pathway, to both stem cell and cancer cell function, TCF4DG, and APCMin crossed to the; Pmsi-H2B-GFP reporter mouse will be analysed.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>332416</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Nexigen GmbH</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Validation of Wnt-small molecule inhibitors</gtr:description><gtr:id>3FF24995-A07B-42B5-BF6A-07C51709AFC6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>structurally confidential</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>H36tSZgoRRb-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>NEXIGEN possesses certain proprietary business, scientific, technical information, trade secrets and know how relating to its technologies and screening platforms, research and development programs and products</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>the methodology and other applications of the University's in vivo and in vitro screening system; the biological/pathological consequences of small molecules delivery; and the mechanism(s) and molecules to control the signalling pathway(s) required for early neoplasia and gastrointestinal repair</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Cancer Research UK</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Cancer Research UK London Research Institute (LRI)</gtr:department><gtr:description>In situ hybridisation analysis of novel Catenin Interacting Proteins (CIPs) expression pattern in embryonic and adult mouse tissues</gtr:description><gtr:id>09448B4F-28D7-4288-841C-0AF51326724A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The work from Dr Bradley Spencer-Dene collaboration (no.1), will be included in a manuscript which is under submission for CIP-1/b-catenin data; he has already provided some essential in situ hybridization data as the CIP-1 expression pattern has not been addressed since identified in mammals</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>6DCF923B902-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>(Collaboration no.1) Dr Bradley Spencer-Dene (BSD) conducted for in-situ hybridization assays using their established non-radioactive labelling techniques for hybridization of mRNA expression for novel b-catenin interacting proteins within the adult tissue sections and whole mounts. cDNA probe and other required materials are provided from my lab.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>For collaboration no.1; we prepare probes for in situ hybridization and provide mice tissues (embryonic, gut adult normal and tumour tissues) which were fixed in 4% PFA and blocked and then sending off to the experimental histopathology lab for examination.

Our data however after testing the Musashi promoter activity showed that Musashi activity is not restricted to intestinal stem cells. 
Then we applied similar strategy to label intestinal stem cells by bio-imaging techniques using Lgr5 (Leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor 5) promoter fused to RFP for in vitro validation assays. Then, we cloned the 2.9kb Lgr5 proximal promoter by PCR using mouse genomic DNA and fused it to RFP for in vitro validation assays in cell culture. Our validation assays using colon cancer HCT116 and SW620 cells transfected with the Lgr5-promoter-RFP confirmed Lgr5 activity and positivity only in 1-2% of the cell population by fluorescent microscopy.
Then, we constructed the transgenic vector in which the expression of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to IRES is controlled by a specific mouse intestinal stem cell marker, Lgr5 promoter and with conditional Cre/LoxP mediated recombination strategy; e.g. villin-Cre. We have already generated few ES cell clones using Electroporation and subsequently genome screening assays based on PCR. These ES cells clones were subjected to Lentivial transduction that express Cre-recombinase and the expression of GFP confirmed by the fluorescent microscopy.
Currently 2- ES clones have been used to generate chimera mice using the tetraploid (4N)-embryonic aggregation technique by the transgenic service facility of the University of Nottingham.</gtr:description><gtr:id>AB476DE7-9248-47B2-BB08-E5FD6639063E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Stem cells are a pluripotent, self-renewing cell type that give rise to differentiated cells. To identify regulatory molecules that function in vivo to determine stem cell fate, we are developing a novel in vivo model involving mouse transgenic line in which the expression of GFP (reporter); is controlled by a specific adult mouse stem cell marker, Lgr5 promoter and with conditional villin-Cre mediated recombination. 

Once the transgenic mouse is equipped it will in principle allow the genetic tracking of normal and/or transformed Lgr5 cells and their offspring within established normal gut and/or tumour tissues. In longer term, we would cross the Lgr5 transgenic mouse with an APC single allele mutation (ApcMin/+) and a conditional homozygous deletion of Tcf4 (Tcf?G) generated in our lab to investigate the involvement of intestinal stem cells in tumourigenesis.

Also, a conditional Lgr5- mouse model and its analysis would warrants publication in high impact journal.

TCF4 is a key regulator of proliferation for intestinal progenitor stem cells, as loss of TCF4 leads to death of mice shortly after birth. We had previously generated the conditional TCF4 knockout DNA plasmid, by which the exons encoding the HMG-DNA binding domain are flanked by loxP sequences, using recently developed BAC/PAC recombinant technology. We have then transfected the linearised DNA into mouse ES cells by electroporation. We have also confirmed of insertion of a specific targeted single copy by Southern blot and PCR analysis. However, ES cells harbouring conditional TCF4 knockout could be useful for the functional analysis of TCF4 in ES cell self-renewal and pluripotency properties studies using Lentiviral expressing vectors with Cre-GFP and GFP expression that we have already developed in the lab.

The ES clone has been injected into the tetraploid (4N) embryos (blastocysts) of recipient mice by the Transgenic Facility in the Biomedical Services Unit, University of Nottingham. We have now obtained hetrozygous Tcf4 single allele floxed-Fred mice. 

Heterozygous mice are intercrossed to yield homozygous mutant mice. Hetrozygous Tcf4 (fl/+) recently been crossed to Flp-recombinase mice to remove the NeoR allele and subsequently will be crossed to specific gut Cre (villin-Cre).</gtr:description><gtr:id>7483CC5C-3FE8-464D-A9C3-4488DA7DE047</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The use of the Cre-LoxP system to obtain conditional, mosaic, inducible and ubiquitous deletion of a floxed gene. In order to obtain mice carrying a cell type specific deletion of the gene of interest, mice carrying the floxed gene of interest are bred with mice expressing Cre recombinase under a cell type specific promoter. The offspring show a deletion of the floxed gene only in cells expressing the Cre recombinase. TCF4 floxed mice (TCF4f/f) has been crossed to Flp-recombinase mice to remove the NeoR allele and subsequently crossed to specific gut Cre (villin-Cre). Heterozygous mice will be intercrossed to yield homozygous mutant mice. 

Therefore, the Tcf4fl/fl mouse line facilitate to study the role of Tcf4 in different tissue.

Also, a conditional intestinal TCF4 K/O mouse generation and its analysis within our MRC funding scope would warrants publication in high impact journal.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>90113100E60</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Conditional TCF4 knockout mouse line</gtr:title><gtr:type>Model of mechanisms or symptoms - mammalian in vivo</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>We have modified and developed a genetic screening system called; Ras Recruitment system (RRS) to isolate protein(s) that are interacting to another (bait protein) in a phosphorylation-dependent-manner.
