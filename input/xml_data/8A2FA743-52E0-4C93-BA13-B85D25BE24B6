For any species to propagate, be it a single celled microbe or a human being, it must be able to duplicate its DNA; thereby ensuring that it passes its genetic instructions onto its progeny. In cells, DNA forms a double helix. For the molecule to replicate, the double helix unzips and both strands are copied to generate two daughter molecules. The structure formed as DNA unzips and is copied is termed the replication fork. This research proposal describes a series of experiments designed to investigate the mechanims by which DNA is unzipped and copied in the replication fork. We propose to study the molecular basis of replication termination in a class of microbe, termed the Archaea. The Archaea we work on grow in hot spring environments, such as found in Yellowstone National Park. Because the organisms grow at 80 degrees centigrade, their cellular machinery is unusually robust and this stability greatly aids our analyses of the organism's biochemistry. Furthermore, over the last few years it has become increasingly apparent that the machinery that Archaea use to duplicate their DNA is a simplified version of the machinery that our own cells use. Therefore, as well as shedding light on the process of replication termination in the archaea, our studies may also yield invaluable insights into the evolution and mechanism of DNA replication fork action in human cells too.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Cellular DNA replication is centred around the replication fork. In this structure, DNA unwinding is coupled to synthesis of leading and lagging strands. Fully reconstituted systems based on the bacterial replication system have been invaluable for uncovering the basic principles of replication fork actio and architrecture. However, the bacterial replication proteins are not orthologous to those in eukaryotes. However, the archaeal replication system is fundamentallyt related to that of eukaryotes. Ths archaea can be used a simple, orthologous model system for the eukaryotic DNA replication apparatus.To date, no biochemically defined system dependent on the archaeal/eukaryotic replicative helicase, the MCM complex has been analysed. In this proposal we outline a series of experiment designed to dissect the in vivo and in vitro function of the archaeal DNA replication fork. We will purifiy enodgenous replication fork-associated complexes using immuno affinity approaches with antisera against MCM helicase and RFC clamp loader. Co-purifying proteins will be identified and recombinant versions purified. The influence of these partner proteins on the catalytic properties of the helicase and clamp loader will be investigated. We will invesitigate the in vivo progression and composition of replication forks using a combination of in vivo labelling with BrdUMP and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. We will carry out series of reconstution assays to generate a defined in vitro system for coupled leading and lagging strand replication.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-05-17</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-05-18</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>727188</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/G006512/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
