Its existence was predicted in 1930 by Dirac who discovered &amp;quot;anti-electrons&amp;quot; while analysing solutions of his famous equation which unified Quantum Mechanics and Relativity. In 1932 positrons were discovered experimentally discovery in cosmic rays by Anderson, both scientists awarded the Nobel prize soon afterwards.

Positrons and other antiparticles are cornerstones of elementary particle theories, such as the Standard Model, and an essential part of the Big Bang theory and our understanding of the Universe. They are also at the root of a fundamental unanswered question of matter-antimatter asymmetry of the world around us.

The most striking feature of antimatter is its ability to annihilate upon encounters with matter. In the case of positrons and electrons, their annihilation results in a burst of gamma rays. This unique signal enables one to detect the presence of positrons in our Galaxy, and underpins a number of crucial positron technologies on Earth. Examples of these are positron-lifetime and annihilation gamma-ray spectroscopies used widely for material characterisation, and positron-emission tomography (PET), a type of medical imaging and functional diagnostic for cancer, neuroimaging (e.g., for Alzheimer's disease), etc.

At the instant of production by Galactic sources or in accelerators or radioactive isotopes, the positrons are fast. Before annihilation they typically undergo a quick succession of ionising collisions with matter that leads to their slowing down and thermalisation. The early studies of positron annihilation in 1950's uncovered that positron annihilation with polyatomic molecules occurred much more quickly than could be expected based on counting the available electrons. This phenomenon remained a unsolved puzzle of positron physics until early this century, when the true physical picture of this phenomenon began to emerge, due to a concerted effort of theory (chiefly, due to PI's work) and experiment.

We now know that positron annihilation in molecules proceeds as a two-step process, in which the positron first undergoes resonant capture into a bound state by transferring its energy into the vibrations of the molecular framework. Although temporal, such &amp;quot;trapping&amp;quot; dramatically increases the probability of positron encounters with electrons and its annihilation. Experimental studies of positron annihilation resonances have provided information on positron bound-state energies for more than 70 molecules. However, theoretical understating of positron binding to most polyatomic molecules is lacking.

Positron binding to polyatomic molecules is a difficult problem. So far standard quantum-chemistry methods have been unable to explain quantitatively even the most obvious trends, such as the linear increase of the bind energy with molecular size for alkanes. The main difficulty here is in the subtlety of binding, which is driven by correlated motion of the positron and atomic electrons.

Based on our previous experience in positron-atom interactions, in this project we plan develop a new approach to positron-molecule interactions. We will construct positron-molecule correlation potentials and &amp;quot;calibrate&amp;quot; them using a small subset of experimental data. This should enable calculation of positron bound-states for the majority of molecules studied so far, and will allow us to make predictions for many other molecules. Calculation of the bound states will also allow us to compute the annihilation gamma-ray spectra, which remains an unsolved problem. Studying the selectivity of positron annihilation with various molecular electrons will further allow us to understand the energy deposition in molecular ions that are formed, and of characteristic patterns of molecular fragmentation that follows annihilation.

This will represent a major advance in understating positron-molecule annihilation.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Positron annihilation underpins important techniques in materials science and medical imaging and provides information on antimatter in the Universe. Our current understanding of positron annihilation in molecules shows that positron-molecule bound states play a crucial role in the process. However, for most molecules studied to date the exact nature of these states, and its implications for the annihilation gamma spectra and molecular fragmentation that follows annihilation, are not known. The project aims to fill in this critical gap and to provide a detailed picture of positron binding to molecules.

This work will have an impact along several lines.

1. Knowledge generation.

The project should greatly enhance our fundamental understanding of positron interactions with molecules positron annihilation in molecular matter in the laboratory conditions, in living tissue (for PET) and in the astrophysical environment. This understanding should allow researchers to &amp;quot;decipher&amp;quot; the information content of the familiar positron annihilation signal in a more complete manner, and to make methods based on positron annihilation more sensitive to the details of the environment where annihilation takes place. This will also enhance the significance of positrons as tools for studying molecular properties, e.g., the ubiquitous process of intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution (IVR), which is a paradigm in the theory of chemical reactions, yet, a process that has proved very difficult to obtain direct quantitative information about.

2. Development of new methods and technologies.

Detailed understanding of positron-molecule annihilation should allow researchers in universities, industrial labs and in health sciences to develop more sophisticated positron-based methods of materials diagnostic and imaging. This would enable them to extract more information from positron annihilation spectroscopy of solids, liquids and polymer systems, as well as, potentially, develop more sensitive technologies for positron emission tomography (PET) that would combine high spatial resolution with elemental/chemical specificity.

3. Personnel training.

The project will provide training for a postdoctoral researcher, which will include both project specific skills in the theory of positron annihilation, and generic skills, such as programming, planning of work, presentation (both on paper and orally), and some aspects of supervision. It is planned that the project will also provide a training ground for a PhD student (supported by NI government scholarship), and will inform a number of final-year masters projects for MSci and MSc students. Work on the projects will bring these students to the current frontier of antimatter research.

4. Public understanding and appreciation of science.

The subject of antimatter fascinates general public. Positrons annihilation is at the heart of PET that would be familiar to most, though not many probably know what &amp;quot;PET scan&amp;quot; stands for. We plan to use this as an opportunity to publicise the research carried out in the course of the project, as well as other positron and antimatter studies pursued in the UK and world-wide. This can take the form of talks at schools and career events aimed at school children, presentations at science festivals, such as the NI Science Festival, and public lectures.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-10-09</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-10-10</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>345646</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R006431/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C88380A2-9C65-425D-B4FB-4E289FACB800</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Atomic &amp; molecular physics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4D22A081-A665-4EAE-8542-CB1050A44B55</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Atoms &amp; Ions</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>66CEB256-1CFB-4A2B-A588-3AC25D4D3FB9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>90</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Scattering &amp; Spectroscopy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
