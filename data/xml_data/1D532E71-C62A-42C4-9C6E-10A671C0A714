Therapy to improve glucose metabolism by the heart have not been widely adopted as they are cumbersome, offer limited benefit and have therefore not been widely adopted in clinical practice. 

This proposed research builds on existing funding from the British Heart Foundation and the MRC to assess the effect of metabolic factors to improve the ability of the heart to tolerate the effects of a reduced blood supply due to coronary artery disease (ischaemia, clinically recognised as angina). A peptide, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), that is secreted mainly by upper intestine in response to food has recently been found to improve the action of insulin in patients with T2DM and improve glucose metabolism. A number of drugs that limit the breakdown of this peptide have now been licensed to treat T2DM, and the proposed research will investigate whether increasing the level of GLP-1 in the blood improves the ability of the heart to tolerate ischaemia.

Our preliminary results suggest that GLP-1 does indeed protect the heart against contractile dysfunction that occurs both during and after ischaemia. I addition, pilot studies in a small number of patients undergoing coronary angioplasty and stenting suggest that an infusion of GLP-1 protects the heart during the therapeutic procedure, which is particularly important in those with T2DM. The research will be informative by allowing the efficacy of a safer metabolic therapy to be tested and confirmation of efficacy in patients with T2DM will provide novel information about the mediation of a therapeutic effect and provide the basis for subsequent interventional studies in patients with CAD and T2DM.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death in patients with diabetes mellitus, and the combination of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and coronary artery disease (CAD) is a major cause of premature cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Glucose-insulin-potassium (GIK) infusions have been used in an attempt to enhance myocardial glucose uptake and protect the heart through the efficacy of this substrate in generating ATP, but the risk of hypoglycaemia, need for relatively intensive monitoring and guarded benefit has limited clinical utility. In addition, the ability of insulin to promote myocardial glucose utilisation and suppresses circulating plasma free fatty acid concentration is constrained in T2DM

This proposed research builds on existing funding from the British Heart Foundation and a MRC Experimental Medicine grant (G0701720) that was awarded as ?a reduced capped award of #100k to allow a small study to be undertaken to see whether GLP 1 produces anything useful.? The preliminary studies have assessed the effect of GLP-1 on left ventricular function during myocardial ischaemia in patients with coronary artery disease during dobutamine stress echocardiography. The results suggest that the peptide protects the heart against ischaemic dysfunction, and by use of the DPP-4 inhibitor sitagliptin to promote the circulating plasma concentration of GLP-1 provide support for the proposal that the myocardial effects are not due to a metabolite of GLP-1, or to changes in the plasma insulin and/or free fatty acid concentrations. 

Similar findings have been seen in the small number of patients studied using an infusion of GLP-1 and this application seeks the support required to complete these studies and investigate the effect of GLP-1 on myocardial glucose uptake and metabolism. We propose that in patients with coronary disease, GLP-1 will improve the ability of the myocardium to respond to stress and protect against post-ischaemic left ventricular dysfunction. In patients with coronary disease and T2DM, we hypothesise that GLP-1 will have a similar protective effect but hyperglycaemia may limit the myocardial response. These studies will be informative by allowing the efficacy of metabolic therapy to be tested during demand ischaemia and confirmation of efficacy in patients with T2DM will provide novel information about the mediation of a therapeutic effect and provide the basis for subsequent interventional studies in patients with CAD and T2DM.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>299917</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>63BA36D5-8FBF-41E6-95C6-F8DB6D9C26DC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Cardiac protection via metabolic modulation: an emerging role for incretin-based therapies?</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Cardiovascular &amp; hematological agents in medicinal chemistry</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9a7391e07aeea71c003b57e92477edfb"><gtr:id>9a7391e07aeea71c003b57e92477edfb</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>McCormick LM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1871-5257</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>pm_15723_23_22827290</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">G1000479</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>D4FDB752-4E9C-491F-9C63-B7D7F6F95417</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cardiovascular</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>160D22D0-5677-4513-A0AC-7F3526B7F336</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Metabolic and Endocrine</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>7135039D-2DB0-4D41-87B3-FA1C8D38E133</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>6.1  Pharmaceuticals</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
