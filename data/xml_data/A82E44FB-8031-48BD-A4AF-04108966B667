Information graphics (infographics) use shape, line, colour and illustration to visually represent data and are recommended as one method by which health communicators can communicate statistical information more effectively (Miranda et al, 2008). However, we understand very little about public opinion towards infographics and of viewer's comprehension of the myriad of diverse infographic types and styles available. 

Searching for the term 'infographics' on google returns over 14 million page returns and the website for infographic designers, www.visual.ly, claims half a million members. Despite the popularity of infographics there is very little evidence to support or challenge their effectiveness, particularly in relation to public healthcare. Spriegelhalter et al (2011) highlight the lack of robust testing of infographics stating that &amp;quot;despite the burgeoning interest in infographics, there is limited experimental evidence on how different types of visualizations are processed and understood&amp;quot;. If the purpose of infographics is to 'reveal data' how can we make the substance and story within that data as clear and compelling as possible?

My research will adopt three approaches to infographic design study in order to gain a more complete picture of the subject - this will involve studying the design process, studying the reception of design and employing design practice.

Firstly, it will involve studying the current approach to commissioning and design of infographics within Public Health England in order to help them improve their communication strategy in this area and to highlight best practice. How do they analyse the datasets they have access to and how is this data interpreted for use by the general public and key decision makers? My research will involve interviewing key staff and managers within Public Health England and other stakeholders and will examine examples of infographics that they currently use. What techniques do they currently use or consider using to make their data tell a more compelling story? 

Secondly, my research will focus on the reception of infographic designs with a broad range of service users. My research will examine, in particular, the reception of embellished infographics (those that include photographs and illustrations to make the infographic more memorable according to Bateman et al., 2010) and the very recent phenomenon of ambient infographics (those that intervene on the street or via evocative objects (Claus &amp;amp; Moeare (2013)). Whilst I will examine a broad range of datasets there will be a particular focus on data provided about transport and health, to reflect the new collaboration between Public Health England (Yorkshire and Humber Centre), West Yorkshire transport organisations and five local authorities. 

Thirdly, the project will involve visualising new data and producing a set of designs that will be used in the public domain. The designs will be based on principles stemming from the research and will present the data in new and compelling ways. The reception of these infographics will also be evaluated.

Together these studies of production and reception will converge in the creation of a set of design tools developed to aid the partner organisation to design infographics more effectively in the future. The research has transformative potential - transforming the working methods of the partner organisation with respect to communicating data and employing design research methods. It will also visualise data in new ways to facilitate greater understanding amongst service users. The project also has potential to impact positively on decision makers in local authorities and transport organisations in the region as well as offer new knowledge to the design and academic communities</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>There are several beneficiaries of this research beyond academia.

Firstly, my partner organisation, Public Health England, will directly benefit from the research and the entire experience of the fellowship award. Public Health England's mission is to protect and improve the nation's health and to address inequalities. According to their website &amp;quot;The government wants everyone to be able to make healthier choices, regardless of their circumstances, and to minimise the risk and impact of illness.&amp;quot; Improving the organisation's use of health infographics will directly address issues of accessibility, equality and health-literacy and thus help PHE to meet key objectives. One of the datasets to be visualised relates to the correlations between health and use of public transport. This topic again directly addresses one of the government's objectives to encourage more physical activity within the general population. 
PHE is a large organisation employing over 5,500 employees across 15 regional centres in the UK. They also work closely with health professionals in the rest of the UK and internationally. My research aims to impact not just upon the Yorkshire and Humber centre but across the organisation as a whole. The main practical outcome of the research - the design tools - will provide PHE with evidenced design guidelines to enable them to communicate their data to their service users more effectively. PHE will also benefit from review documents and presentations that enable them to reflect more about their own design processes and identify areas of opportunity. They will also benefit from being directly involved in design research with their service users, learning design methodologies to embed into their own practice. Overall the project will have a positive impact on the effectiveness of their services and impact upon their organisational policy regarding data use and visualisation. 

The general public will ultimately benefit from the research. By directly using a diverse set of service users within the research, I and my partner organisation will be in a stronger position to make more effective designs for them long term. The infographics designed and displayed towards the end of the research period (relating to use of public transport and health benefits) will facilitate greater understanding of the implications of lifestyle choices for the general public, equipping them more strongly to make decisions about change. This has potential to positively impact on the well-being of those Yorkshire and Humber region residents who alter behaviour due, in part, to seeing the designs developed as part of this project.

The designs will enable decision makers at local authorities and public transport organisations to understand the relationship between health and use of public transport more clearly, providing a rationale for other possible changes within local government. The results of the focus groups will help local authorities to understand more about the public's views regarding transport and health, thus enabling the organisations to tailor their own communications to them. Results will be disseminated via a final presentation of project findings that will be addressed to these decision makers as well as to PHE-YH.

The design community will benefit from the research findings as it will expand practicing designers' knowledge about infographic design principles, and in particular help them consider when and how to use embellishment and ambient approaches in visualising data. It will also be of interest to those organisations who work with health related data and wish to commission designs, offering them a tool for evaluating designs made before distributing them. There will ultimately be economic benefits to these parties, as design guidelines will help reduce the need for further expensive tests. To reach these communities, results from the project will be 'seeded' online on design and health blogs.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>97237</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>As part of the project a series of street infographic designs were produced with the West Yorkshire Air Quality Strategy Group to test out the design principles that emerged from the primary research phase. The designs were included in a proposal document that was circulated within the strategy group. One artefact was developed for implementation. An air monitoring station in the centre of Bradford was wrapped in an original infographic design to highlight the air quality measurement at that location. 4 sides of the monitoring station were wrapped in vinyl for approximately 3 months from September 2015. Bright colours and a clear message were adopted as part of the presentation technique. The site-specific nature of the design allowed the infographic to literally make visible something that cannot be seen. This was emphasised by the backdrop for the infographic which was designed to 'disappear' at certain angles through the featuring of photography taken at the actual location.</gtr:description><gtr:id>84DE52CF-5021-4DB0-AA25-56368BE5952A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Since Shipley Airedale Road is one of the busiest roads in the area, thousands of motorists will have been exposed to the infographic and its meaning. An observation test during its first week showed that approximately 25% of stationary motorists turned their heads to view the infographic. Given the fact that the audience was mobile, it was difficult to capture more qualitative data about the work's impact. 
The infographic was mentioned in an article in the Telegraph and Argus paper on the 23rd December 2015, raising discussion about poor air quality in the area. 
Reaction to the work from the air quality group itself was very positive and it is hoped that further work will occur as a result.

The research showed that staff had positive views about the potential of infographics though they saw other organisations, particularly charities, as having the competitive advantage. The research showed that particular problems related to issues of time, software availability and design skills. Participants presented a number of projects, with a range of styles and infographic approaches without a coherent strategic vision and thus much work is required in terms of enabling a standard and evidence-based approach to designing infographics.

The 'tests' on the general public resulted in several key findings. Participants tended to just glance at embellishments and instead remained focused on text, suggesting that embellishment may play a role more in 'implicit appeal' rather than 'explicit pull' of attention. Eye tracking didn't show a conclusive increase in attention when infographics were embellished. Use of grids however, were of primary importance, allowing the eye to be guided in a meaningful way around the compositions. 

The results of recall tests showed that people generally have a poor capacity for free short-term recall for both health statistics and infographic features. The results showed marginal increase overall in recall when embellished infographics were used (only 7 out of the 12 designs were more recalled when embellished) but recall seemed greater when high-appeal street infographic mock ups were used. The results also underscore the importance of infographic content. The main reason cited for recall was that of a personal connection with the content of the data followed by the evocation of surprise. Adding embellishment to an already busy composition was not found to aid comprehension with text being the main device used to answer the questions. However, embellished infographics did receive many more positive comments in terms of preference and thus qualities of figuration, texture and realism do seem valued by the general public. Overall the findings point to inconclusive evidence about the cognitive or attentive role of embellishments within infographics but to strong evidence about appeal and in particular, appeal for the use of colour, figuration and photography. It's not yet clear how preference/appeal effects issues of cognition and this is a further direction for future work. 

Findings from the focus groups suggest that personal risk infographics are likely to contribute to behavioural change but as part of a wider mixture of forces at play.
Participants overall rated positively-framed and photographic infographics more trustworthy and preferred than other forms. Negatively framed cartoon drawings were ranked low for trustworthiness and discussed critically. Photography was particularly well received with the notion expressed by participants that 'it could be them'.

The above findings (together with results from a literature review) were used to develop a set of design guidelines for use by Public Health England and within Public Health divisions of local authorities.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings can be put to use through the further dissemination of the resultant design guidelines. The guidelines have allowed research findings to be folded into concrete recommendations for local authorities and PHE to easily follow. As they are disseminated beyond the region, contacts for potential further research are being collected.

The findings can be further expanded by carrying out research on specific user groups e.g. pregnant women or people with certain health-related behaviour. Such a need has already been expressed by directors of public health in the area and thus this may well be an area of further funding requests. Further collaboration with local authorities with specific communication needs would be a natural next step for the project. 

Findings from the research has already been embedded within the level 3 module 'Information Design' at the University of Leeds and thus undergraduate students are already putting some of the findings to use in their own projects. The charity DrinkAware are also keen to work with the Principal Investigator to put the guidelines principles into practice for their own campaigns.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>70A12161-57FC-40FE-AB85-7F828667C503</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56cd9e20780dc7.45999795</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.visualisinghealth.com</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AFCD098F-60A2-4056-AD60-DF7642D049CD</gtr:id><gtr:title>&amp;quot; If The Guardian can do it, we should be able to do it!&amp;quot; Examining Public Health Infographic Strategies used by Public Health Professionals</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/12a084af976422db469ed01d5a4ede41"><gtr:id>12a084af976422db469ed01d5a4ede41</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Stones C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56b20fdee31270.85710699</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>55A0FF1A-B728-4831-A401-0904F6CC3AE6</gtr:id><gtr:title>What Makes Public Health Infographics Memorable?
