The Gravity Fields Festival celebrates Sir Isaac Newton's close relationship with the area of south Lincolnshire and the town of Grantham through a biennial festival which was staged for the first time in 2012 with an overall audience of 37,000. The festival is aspirational in nature and designed to appeal to a broad cross section of the general public.

The festival's aims include bringing an understanding of the physical sciences to the general population of the area and to visitors from beyond the area.
 
The proposed event will run for two of the five days of the festival, Friday 26th and Saturday 27th September. The event will take place at one of the main festival venues in the town centre of Grantham. 

The aim for all audiences is:-
To foster better understanding of the CERN LHC facility, who works there, how it works and the international partnerships
To understand the areas of science studied at CERN LHC and its outcomes and potential future outcomes
To gain a greater understanding of the applications of particle physics both at CERN and in facilities worldwide

And for young people in particular:-
To inspire young people to work in science and particularly interest them in physics
To inspire young people from the area to believe in their potential to study and work at a high level in any field

Target Audiences

Friday 26th September 

Morning - Primary Schools audiences to attend exhibition, interactive and audio visual display elements with short talk from science educators. Aims - introductory understanding of the impact of physics on our lives and understanding and what the CERN LHC is and does.

Afternoon - Secondary schools, particularly sixth form science students, will be invited alongside the general public to specifically programmed talks to learn more about CERN and related science
 
After School/Early Evening - The exhibition elements will be open for the general public 

Saturday 27th September

All day - the general public will be invited to view the exhibition and to attend related talks during the day at the same venue, An additional aim of the Saturday opening will be to add the extra dimension of looking at future areas of development in this field in facilities across the world.

Following the festival the display elements of the event will be offered to and available for other science festivals and institutions to build CERN LIVE events into their events around the country.

This event will continue to develop the Gravity Fields Festival's partnerships with scientists. 

The event has been suggested by the Festival Patron, Professor Valerie Gibson, Head of High Energy Physics at the University of Cambridge and formally UK Spokesperson for the LHCb experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in CERN. She also originally comes from Grantham and attended school locally. She will speak at the festival and Dr Harry Cliff, her research associate and the content curator of the Science Museum Collider exhibition, will support the event with research and his presence and a talk at the event.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The resource materials to be produced to market the event will include -

Festival website - full explanation of event and links to related projects including CERN LHC

Festival programme - souvenir programme - Article in addition to event information within festival programme - this is available to audiences attending the festival

Education pack for Festival to be distributed to all the schools in the District Council area and the adjoining Districts in advance of the festival to give details of the festival events including CERN LIVE to teachers and schools.

Explanatory pamphlet to be produced by Festival organisers for schools and general public attending the event.

Video interviews to be recorded by speakers at the event to be included with the future exhibition physical assets.

The exhibition to be offered via the Festival Director and Harry Cliff to other science festivals, museums or events with similar aims. 

The BBC Bus will be present as a 'virtual laboratory' at the festival and will cover the CERN LIVE event broadcasting interviews and radio coverage of the event to the Lincolnshire area. The BBC Bus also comes with a satellite link to provide additional interactive elements and connectivity as required for public participation.

Benefiting from the high profile and success of the 2012 Gravity Fields Festival, it is anticipated that there will be high level of regional media interest in the festival from the BBC TV Look North teams and ITV's Calendar News (ex Yorkshire TV). Regional TV, radio and newspapers are already broadcasting items about the preparations for the event and CERN LIVE will benfit from this regional coverage. 

National media - in 2012 there was coverage of the festival from BBC Radio 4 and we anticipate this will be repeated in 2014.

The festival is programming speakers and science educators from around the UK so the exhibition will also be visible to many science educators and academics who have links with other outreach events and public engagement projects across the country.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-11-06</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-07-07</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>10000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/M002314/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
