In interwar Britain, growing public anxieties about the police reached an important peak in 1928, culminating in the Royal Commission on Police Powers and Procedure (that concluded the following year). High profile cases involving female suspects significantly drove those concerns. These women were often turned into media celebrities, discussed not only on the front pages of newspapers but also in parliamentary debates and committees. Their cases spoke not only to narratives of crime and femininity but also to issues such as the presentation and reception of stories of women's victimisation, the police treatment of suspects (particularly women) and the political and press responses to accusations regarding the illegitimate use of police powers. Research will take place in two stages. The first involves detailed attention to cases from 1928; the second puts those events into context through a broader survey of the popular press and police records.\n\nThe year 1928 will serve as the project's chronological anchor and be the focus of the first phase of research, not only due to initial indications suggesting that police power and female victimhood seem to have been particularly significant media topics then but also because of the calling of the Royal Commission. Based upon their extensive coverage of relevant issues, we have chosen selected newspapers as our main sources, including popular papers targeted at a female readership as well as more serious and politically oriented papers, thus providing a broad spectrum of styles and perspectives on the main issues to be studied. Police files and parliamentary debates and reports regarding these cases will also be important sources. Press and official sources will be analysed qualitatively to identify the key themes (such as innocence, femininity, helplessness and vulnerability) in the construction of relevant narratives; the factors that affected the ways cases were presented and treated; and the different roles played by the press, the police and women themselves.\n\nThe second phase will contextualise the results of the first by examining newspaper reporting in the two years that preceded and followed 1928. A newspaper search from 1926-27 would determine the extent to which the narratives common in 1928 built upon -- or deviated from -- previous discourses surrounding issues of gender, crime and police power. A study of 1929-30 would then evaluate the impact that repeated scandals and parliamentary inquiry had on press reporting about female victims of police power and the relationship between police and public. For the period 1926-27, research would focus on locating instances of alleged or demonstrated abuse of police powers (particularly those involving women) and identifying the extent to which their themes or presentation would make them precursors of the more in-depth case profiles developed in the first research phase. For the years 1929 and 1930, stories dealing directly with cases examined in the first research phase and coverage of police reforms instituted in the wake of the Royal Commission on Police Powers and Procedure will also be analysed, as will commentary on other legal issues that arose from key cases from 1928 (e.g., coroner's court reform or the need for a public defender).\n\nBy exploring the interrelations between gender, media and the issue of police power, this project will not only provide a detailed cultural history of the late 1920s -- a period for which the historiography of crime is underdeveloped -- but also speak to the interrelations between press reporting and policy development, topics of considerable contemporary relevance.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>98440</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5218AD6B-3B80-4D1C-B4D4-1CBC49A6EE6D</gtr:id><gtr:title>'The Third Degree': Press Reporting, Crime Fiction and Police Powers in 1920s Britain</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Twentieth Century British History</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/33205ca33570b62b3a3cb0852e802652"><gtr:id>33205ca33570b62b3a3cb0852e802652</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wood J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d048048436b403</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/F018150/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DCE73056-5E3D-4976-B573-234E5FF4D633</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic &amp; Social History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
