It has a very practical basis: the project team will work with the organisers of three cultural festivals to programme a range of musical events and these will become the focus of a process of theoretical and ethnographic exploration developed in collaboration with the participants. The performances at the centre of the research will be drawn from non-European, refugee, diaspora cultures in the North of England and programmed in a series of events hosted by the network of three HEIs and two arts organisations established by this funding proposal. We seek to answer the following questions: How can arts festivals frame audience and performer within these performance events? In what way do these framings relate to wider conceptions of exile, group membership and festival? How are performances best mediated, archived and made accessible beyond the festival timeline? How do these mediations manifest the tension between festivals and the commodification of experience? And finally, what elements of good practice can be learnt and transmitted to future festivals and other refugee groups and contexts?

The proposed network will focus on seven musical performances held within the context of three festivals with national profiles. Two (Sensoria and Tramlines) are situated in Sheffield, while the third also takes place in Sheffield, but under the umbrella of a multi-agency national festival, Refugee Week. Beyond the proximity of the researchers and project participants, Sheffield makes a suitable host city as it became the first City of Sanctuary for refugees and asylum-seekers in 2007. With the support of the City Council it remains such and hosts high profile events during Refugee Week. The research is thus designed to understand an urban and civic context attuned to cultural festivals, performance and the experience of refugees. To achieve this the network will draw on the expertise of its two Project Participants, Sensoria and Arts on the Run. Sensoria is the UK's festival of music, film and digital art. Held in April, it is entering its fifth year of operation. Sensoria also has a hosting arrangement with Tramlines, a large multi-venue free access music festival held in July. Arts on the Run is the Yorkshire and Humberside Regional Hub for Platforma, the national refugee arts network, with extensive experience in refugee arts management. This is, however, the first time either of the Project Participants have collaborated with each other or the HEIs involved, and the first time the three festivals (Sensoria, Refugee Week and Tramlines) have been linked.

The project thus responds to the second Translating Culture research question in that it seeks to explore both the translation of diaspora and refugee experience through artistic collaboration, and the process by which such translations are subsequently mediated, archived and interpreted. In terms of reception, it is concerned with local, academic and non-academic, intergenerational audiences, in addition to the mediations produced through the digital, national and local media. The purpose of distributing performances amongst the festivals is to add depth to the research, not only in terms of academic framing and analysis, but also in the relationship of the performances/cultural events to each other. The aim is that networks, correspondences and an internal sense of coherence should emerge among the events themselves. This is intended to build on and maximise public engagement in the performances, the research network and the research outcomes. A website will ensure the research retains an overall structure, acting as both portal and locus for representation and discussion for all participants in the project, academic and non-academic, student, resident and refugee.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research outputs will benefit academia, the public sector, the third sector and the general public. As a multi-disciplinary, inter-disciplinary project, English, Music, Modern Languages, Journalism, Diaspora Studies, Intercultural Communication and Leisure Studies will all be addressed through a research paper interrogating roles of audience and performer in the context of refugee performance events held within UK arts festivals. The paper will possess multi-disciplinary relevancy, contributing to the mutual health of any discipline that engages with the lens of performance. Thus, by drawing on the cross-cutting theoretical orientation of the Research Team, the paper has the potential to be of general relevance and be widely circulated. The paper will also demonstrate the relevance of ethnography as an inter-disciplinary methodology, specifically its engagement with disciplinary-based practices from Journalism, Music, English and Intercultural Communication. Its academic impact will be heightened by the wide international relevance of refugees, asylum seekers and the arts sector. As a consequence and in order to maximise its effective dissemination the research paper will be submitted to a UK journal that possesses an international readership. It is anticipated that the paper will be ready for publication by the completion of the research period. It will contain suggestions future research and will direct readers to the project website where performances and participation will be archived. Furthermore, it is intended that the research network established by the bid will collaborate on future projects and be the source of future outputs. The research paper will also outline guidelines for best practice in relation to the management of refugee arts performances, especially the manner in which they are structured and programmed to engage a public audience.

The same research output will thus be of interest and relevance to the UK Public Sector, particularly at local governance level, where it will directly contribute to evidence based policy making decisions concerning arts festival provision and planning, and refugee arts funding and execution. These guidelines will also be of direct use and relevance to the Third Sector, namely arts festivals, refugee organisations and any organisation that hosts arts performances that seek to engage the public with the wider project of cultural translation, especially museums and galleries. In terms of outputs, both the Public Sector and the Third Sector will be further engaged by the Report Digest, a key document which will target these audiences specifically in an attempt to circulate the research's findings as widely and as deeply as possible. To this end, Sensoria (directly networked in the bid) and Tramlines (indirectly) are both founding members of the 'As If' network of independent festivals: a useful mechanisms to disseminate guidelines, results and learning experiences. The outputs will thus enhancing the research capacity, knowledge and skills of businesses and organisations.

There are broad social welfare benefits from the project which the outputs will seek to qualify. The public will thus benefit by being engaged in refugee issues, made accessible through the project website, which will be referred to within the research's national and local media outputs, targeted by the expertise of the RA. Members of the refugee community will be directly engaged, as will the audience of Sensoria and Tramlines, both in the timeframe of the project and in the future, as the research output will influence their programming. Since Tramlines has an emphasis on young people, the project will have a firm intergenerational impact. As the project is generalisable beyond Sheffield, the wider UK public will benefit, as the outputs will enrich national culture and enhance the potential for social cohesion through the shaping of future arts events, over the duration of the project and beyond.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-08-05</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-06</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>23992</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The research team collaborated with the team of the Sensoria Festival to organise a performance by refugee Tuareg musicians at a small venue in Sheffield.

The main non-academic partners were the'Tramlines' music festival (http://tramlines.org.uk/), the 'Sensoria' festival of music, film, and digital art (http://www.sensoria.org.uk/), and 'Assist', a charity 'challenging asylum destitution' (http://www.assistsheffield.org.uk/ ). In addition, representatives from organisations such as the 'Arts on the Run' network for arts and refugees (http://www.artsontherun.org.uk/) became involved because they were existing partners of the participating organisations.

The participating organisations all confirmed that the work had influenced their thinking on the programming of music by refugee performers and the value they placed on the collaboration is evident in their continued desire to work with the academic participants. Later in 2012 Matthew Cheeseman secured further funding from the Higher Education Innovation Fund to continue working with 'Sensoria' on musical culture in South Yorkshire, focusing particularly on the possibilities of using augmented reality and mobile phone applications in interpreting musical heritage in the region. He also used HEIF funding to develop work informed by the Translating Performance project at Sheffield University's experimental urban space, 'Furnace Park'. This work was built upon connections developed during the network project. Similarly, Tony Bowring from 'Arts on the Run' went on to collaborate with Richard Steadman-Jones as one of the musicians involved in the AHRC-funded project 'Transmitting Musical Heritage'. That project focused on processes of transmission in a variety of musical traditions and Bowring's contribution related to his own work with refugee musicians, particularly in the context of the 'world music collective', Rafiki Jazz (http://www.konimusic.co.uk/portfolio/rafikijazz/), one of the groups which performed at the 'World Over' concert and workshops organised by 'Assist'. Since he was one of the participants who was perhaps most sceptical about the possibility of discussing musical practice in a non-musical language, it was important to us that Bowring went on to participate in the later project and became involved in writing about it.

The 'Translating Performance' also led to a formalisation of the relationship between Assist and the University of Sheffield, the University going to on to donate further resources in support of the charity and becoming a part of the Universities of Sanctuary network, a commitment which involved offering annual scholarships to asylum seekers.
In April 2014 Matthew Cheeseman presented a paper at Birmingham City University reflecting on the longer term impact of the work. He also presented updated versions of the paper in May 2016 as a part of a roundtable at 'Humanities and Beyond: Exploring the Frontiers of Interdisciplinary', which took place at the University of York, and in February 2017 at 'The Experience of AHRC-funded Early Career Researchers in Themes and Programmes', again hosted by Birmingham City University. (He is preparing this material for publication.) Cheeseman's account of the project included reflections on the ethical dimensions of participatory research, a concern which underpinned his designing of training in Research Ethics and Integrity for all PhD students in Sheffield University's Faculty of Arts and Humanities between 2013 and 2016. Similarly, Richard Steadman-Jones' experience on the 'Translating Performance' project informed his later work as a CI on the RCUK-funded 'Imagine' project, which focused specifically on the utopian potentials of arts practice and involved collaboration between academics and arts practitioners.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>1DAADFEE-CF2A-4264-BAB4-C03F01840F84</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>58c7de35bb6df0.01809211</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project investigated how refugee experience is translated in the context of urban arts festivals and Sheffield was chosen as host city for its active festival scene and longstanding emphasis on refugee issues. Eight performances were programmed within the context of three nationally visible festivals. Two (Sensoria and Tramlines) take place in Sheffield, while the third (Refugee Week) involves multiple agencies and centres. By distributing performances amongst festivals with distinct identities and scales the research sought to develop a rich understanding of the urban and civic context in which musicians and organisers operate.

The larger the audience and the less focused their motivations, the harder it was to translate questions of refugee experience. In festivals without this explicit emphasis, intimacy and scale were vital. Variable contexts led to striking re-framings of particular performers - from 'political collective' to 'boy band', from practitioners of particular musical styles to exponents of a generic 'world music'. Online attempts to develop community amongst organisers and audience proved less successful than anticipated and the work underlined the importance of the embodied festival experience. That said, a vinyl release arising from the performances later proved useful for engagement activities by all project participants and researchers were struck by the value of the physical artefact in contrast with digital materials.

The research used ethnographic techniques to examine how festival organisers went about negotiating and positioning refugee experience. Two closely related themes emerged: (a) the embedding of musical performances/events within the music business, and (b) the organisers' desire to bring about a kind of ethically charged 'encounter with the other'. Organisers could simultaneously be hard-headed about the business context and relatively utopian about particular encounters with refugees that had changed their own lives. While music was not always seen as the best way of engendering such encounters, it was highly valued as an autonomous form of practice, one that resisted academic commentary and offered its own alternative forms of communication, representation, and reflection. Ethnography is well suited to negotiating this complex terrain because of its focus on 'grounded' rather than 'big theory' and because of its adaptability as a mode of participatory practice. The fieldwork did not - could not - characterise the practice of organisers as an inert object of enquiry but had to become self-reflexive and engage with the interaction of business context and ethical aspiration in academic as well as cultural practice.

In performing music from another culture/tradition (often with refugee musicians), or responding (however instrumentally) to funding exigencies, the organisers had become deeply involved with ethical issues and this was particularly pronounced amongst those involved in participatory music techniques. However, most of the organisers actively acknowledged the difficulty of translating ethical impulses via musical activity and pointed to performances which they saw as problematic because ethical beliefs interfered with the music-making or because the music was judged a failure in translating ideas to an audience. Thus their work is already a site of reflection and struggle, a fact that should form the focus of future investigation.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We feel that the most useful aspect of the work for others is the focus on the use of ethnographic techniques in developing reflective practice with creative practitioners. The ethnographic approach 'makes sense' to people who work in cultural fields and has been particularly successful in interactions with musicians, who - as outlined above - are sometimes resisted to linguistic accounts of what they do, feeling that musical practice itself is a mode of communication, representation and reflection. Ethnographic methods lend themselves to the coproduction of knowledge and take seriously the knowledge that participants have of their own practice. As such, we would argue that organisations outside universities could make productive use of the kinds of ethnography undertaken here in examining the processes of translation and mediation involved in their practice.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>AEB59799-292E-40B8-93CE-1E92D2822C42</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c3ebe0200218.96364664</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>36BF3018-8E5A-4996-A2BF-5CA281C89259</gtr:id><gtr:title>360-Degree Answers in (Re)Presenting the Archive</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/fc6cd4d272249bcfe20a3f12037c750e"><gtr:id>fc6cd4d272249bcfe20a3f12037c750e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cheeseman M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58c52a789fa211.95128307</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/J012629/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12F57045-398B-4CC0-BF63-76C038A2E247</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural &amp; museum studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>0AEFDABE-67A4-48B1-9DB4-99393BDE6065</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Music</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0BD15AF-D726-4525-A824-5C01385833D3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ethnography &amp; Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9DFBE9F1-538E-4C96-B606-5163472E6960</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Literary &amp; Cultural Theory</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3BFAE48F-77C7-453F-8049-A1455B8B0E96</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Music &amp; Society</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>76FB1E61-2A96-432A-BFFC-56D6B977DF1E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Policy, Arts Mgmt &amp; Creat Ind</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
