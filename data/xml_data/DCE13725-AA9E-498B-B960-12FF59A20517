The daily-circadian-regulation of body rhythms is controlled by a group of cells in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. These cells employ a specific molecular machinery of so-called clock genes, which use a self-regulating feedback system to maintain an approximate 24-hour rhythm of activity. This central clock / whose activity is fine tuned by external cues such as light / regulates multiple physiological systems including endocrine, metabolic, cardiovascular, cognitive and behavioural outputs. The discovery that clock genes are also found in other areas of the brain and in many peripheral tissues challenges the concept of a single SCN pacemaker. Unlike the SCN however, the clock genes in these other areas do not necessarily express independent long-term rhythms and need the SCN to entrain and maintain their rhythms. This immediately demands that we address the question of how the SCN can control these slave oscillators. One obvious candidate as a controller of the clock genes outside the SCN is the glucocorticoid secreted by the adrenal cortex, which is secreted in a circadian rhythm. This rhythm is under the control of the SCN, and we have recently shown that signalling through this system depends on both its circadian rhythm and the pulse character of its secretion. Furthermore, we know that a critically important clock gene / period 1 (per 1) / has the molecular signature that allows it to be regulated by glucocorticoids. In this application therefore, we want to define how the SCN effects glucocorticoid secretory dynamics, and how changes in these dynamics alter the regulation of clock genes in areas of the brain vital for cognitive function and anxiety behaviour. We shall then go on to investigate how these changes in clock genes alter the efficiency of neurones to interact (synaptic plasticity) and how this in turn alters the memory abilities of conscious animals.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Although the role of the SCN in the regulation of circadian function has been appreciated for many years, the role and regulation of peripheral clocks both in the CNS and in peripheral tissues is poorly understood. What is clear is that many of these peripheral oscillators cannot maintain their episodic activity in the absence of the SCN, and thus there must be some form neural or circulating signal that can coordinate these slave oscillators. Since one of the major clock genes / period 1 (per 1) has glucocorticoid response elements in its five prime - upstream sequence, and its expression can be induced by glucocorticoids, this would suggest that circulating glucocorticoids which are secreted in both an ultradian and circadian rhythm, may be an important factor in setting the activity of these oscillators. We should like to test this hypothesis by: 1. Clarifying the effect of the SCN on ultradian as well and circadian rhythmicity of glucocorticoid secretion. 2. Revealing the effects of altering the glucocorticoid circadian rhythm on per 1 and/or per 2 activity. 3. Investigating how blocking the activation of per 1 and/or per 2 by glucocorticoid effects synaptic plasticity 4. Examining the role of PER 1 activation in cognitive function</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-09-18</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-09-19</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>500957</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We discovered that experimentally destroying g the brain's master circadian clock did not affect the &amp;lt;24h rhythms (ultradian) rhythms in corticosterone release, but did abolish ~24h (circadian) rhythms in behaviour. This demonstrates for the first time that a separate non-circadian oscillator controls ultradian rhythms in corticosterone release and that this can function without input from the brain's master circadian clock. 

Further, we found that other brain oscillators that do not function very well when disconnected from the master brain clock could not be induced to oscillate by applications of corticosterone. This indicates that although the brain has access to and respond to corticosterone signals, these signals could not drive daily rhythms in brain clocks. 

Further, we also found daily variation in corticosterone signalling plays a role in how periodic availability of food evokes behaviours in rodents. This action depended on the type of diet that the animals were maintained on. Thus interactions between corticosterone and fat-content of diets influenced rhythmic behaviour in rodents.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Pharmaceutical firms may be interested in compounds that influence corticosterone actions in the brain, particularly with regards to effects on meal selection and diet.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>2C7351E7-145F-4AAF-81A7-C442396087FF</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e01ed3290375.20034579</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C9E4DCBF-ED1E-4D18-ADBA-5319B3BAFAA5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Constant light enhances synchrony among circadian clock cells and promotes behavioral rhythms in VPAC2-signaling deficient mice.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Scientific reports</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/34c3c0efbed7b40f60a19e0052c1aebf"><gtr:id>34c3c0efbed7b40f60a19e0052c1aebf</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hughes AT</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2045-2322</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5675eb80e7cf5</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>63BCA194-01C1-49FA-A2D0-0C59F4F53CD5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Dietary fat and corticosterone levels are contributing factors to meal anticipation.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>American journal of physiology.
