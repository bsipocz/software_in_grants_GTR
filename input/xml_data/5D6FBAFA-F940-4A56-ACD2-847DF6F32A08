construction</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/N006607/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Awareness of the impacts of climate change, rising energy prices, fuel poverty and a demand for energy security have prompted significant changes in design thinking, construction practice, building materials and building legislation aimed at reducing energy use and carbon dioxide emissions. A particular example of this is the fabric first approach and increasing requirements for air-tightness in housing. Whilst this achieves a primary objective of reducing heat loss through ventilation, other requirements for ventilation have not kept pace and there is emerging evidence of poor indoor air quality and inadequate ventilation. This in turn has been linked to a multitude of public health issues, particularly for conditions such as asthma, allergies and COPD that are all known to be exacerbated by poor air quality. 
 
Our goal is to bring public health and building professionals together with architects and their clients to identify shared research questions and develop ways of addressing these issues, with an overall aim of supporting the design of healthy, low energy homes. Despite shared interests between the built environment, environmental health and medical research communities, they are generally not well connected. Indeed there is also very little connection between the housing research and fuel poverty communities as well. The programme therefore aims to bridge the gap between these complementary fields, providing a platform for discussion and collaboration while facilitating knowledge exchange to the built environment industries, such as housing associations and architects. The programme will involve a trans-disciplinary team comprising of academics and industry professionals from the fields of respiratory health, indoor air quality and the built environment.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The intended audience and beneficiaries of the programme include built environment professionals (architects, ventilation suppliers, Mechanical and Electrical contractors), organisations involved in the delivery of airtight dwellings (Housing Associations, clients, sustainability consultants, government bodies and policy makers), and ultimately the end user (home owners and tenants). Similarly, the programme would be of benefit to organisations interested in public and environmental health (such as public health charities, health care providers, and environmental health officers). 
 
Specifically, anticipated impacts from the planned outcomes include: 
 
1) Advances of building policies and industry standards for ventilation and energy to ensure the protection and enhancement of occupant health in airtight dwellings, through improvements of indoor environmental conditions 
2) Improvements in the design process to recognise the health implications of architectural design decisions 
3) International development through the involvement of overseas participants and dissemination of results worldwide through an online platform 
5) Economic benefits through the hosting of networking activities, engagement from international participants, and the development of funding proposals (UK and European based) at the sandpit event 
6) Advancement of the quality of housing provision for both private and social housing sectors 
7) Improvements to public health services and associated economic benefits, through advancing knowledge for the prevention and treatment of Building Related Illnesses, such as asthma, allergies and respiratory diseases 
8) Enhancement of quality of life through improvements of indoor air quality and thermal comfort 
9) Advancement of energy efficient design strategies to reduce carbon emissions and meet the targets set out by the Climate Change Act (2008) 
10) Development of professional (management, networking, presentation, collaboration) and academic (methodological, analytical) skills of network participants that can be applied in all employment sectors 
 
It is anticipated that the proposed research network will ultimately help to improve the design of energy efficient buildings, particularly within the residential sector, while enhancing the quality of life of the building occupants, through improved indoor air quality and ventilation provision. In the short term, it is expected to stimulate new collaborative and/or applied research projects through sustained communication and participation of both academic and non-academic participants in the sandpit event, and also explore the development of new products and services to achieve these goals. In addition, the network will help to inform the proposed changes to the Scottish Building Regulations regarding ventilation provision over the coming years, following the consultation in February 2015. 
 
Where possible, the impact of the research network will be monitored. For example, the impact of dissemination activities can be observed through website analytical tools, number of citations and download statistics.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-04-26</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-04-27</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>35755</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>BBC coverage of health effects of ventilation</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5E49E643-0688-4E9C-9491-0738371A26A9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Recorded piece of health effects of modern homes, followed by live interview on BBC Breakfast 26 April 2017.

Development of an Elective on 'Indoor Air Quality' (based on findings from the HEMAC network) to be delivered as part of the new Part-time MSc in Environmental Architecture</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>7C83C957-D4A1-4BA5-AA31-FFCC39A19290</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>58c6c219089465.42717853</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The funding has facilitated the establishment of an inclusive and active network of researchers and practitioners in the fields of medicine, engineering, microbiology, indoor air science, building physics, architecture and ventilation. The multidisciplinary committee of over 30 members has provided a strong foundation for the network and helped to attract a wide range of participants to the funded network events (Symposium event: 89 participants; Workshop event: 46 participants).

The network has developed strong links with other leading local and international organisations in the field, including the UKIEG, AIVC, ISIAQ, ASBP, ARCC, REHVA, ASHRAE (Scotland), UKCMB, PLEA and The Aerosol Society. In addition to the funded events, the network has supported a range of other events including the Scottish Passivhaus Projects Update (16/05/16, The University of Strathclyde), and the hosting of the annual UK Indoor Environments Group Conference (26/04/17, the Glasgow School of Art); which marks the first time the UKIEG annual conference will be held in Scotland. Activities have resulted in a number of forums at the upcoming international Passive Low Energy Architecture (PLEA) Conference (Edinburgh, 3-5th July 2017), including a new forum on 'Indoor Air Quality and Health'. 

The development of an online platform has facilitated the promotion of networking activities, increased awareness of the network and helped disseminate outcomes to an international audience. Since development, the platform has received over 1,000 visitors (&amp;gt;3,600 views) from all over the world. 

The involvement of industry professionals (ventilation suppliers, housing associations, architects, clinicians and consultants) and policy makers (Scottish Building Standards Division) has helped to increase awareness and knowledge of the health effects of modern airtight construction and facilitated the transfer and exchange of knowledge between research and practice. 

The funded network events have assisted in mapping the research context, identifying current gaps in knowledge and outlining a number of key research priorities. This has already resulted in several multidisciplinary funding applications (2x AHRC, 1x Dunhill Medical Trust and 1x Chest Heart and Stroke Scotland applications) and is expected to result in more following the Sandpit event in April this year (25/04/17).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings will be taken forward through several submitted funding applications, as detailed below.

i) A pilot investigation into relationships between ventilation and health status of people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in contemporary airtight homes

Although the effects of outdoor air pollution on COPD are well established, the effects of indoor air pollution on COPD, especially in the elderly, remain unknown. The proposed study would be the initial step in investigating for the first time whether modern airtight housing adversely affects the respiratory health of elderly people with COPD, with the aim of identifying whether practical changes to the indoor environment reduces ill-health and improves quality of life for elderly people with COPD. 

ii) Influence of ventilation design on the prevalence of anti-microbial bacteria in homes

This proposed study will bring together architectural design, ventilation engineering and microbiology expertise to evaluate how design may influence the presence of AMR microorganisms in homes. While ventilation has been identified as a primary driver in the structure of the microbial community in buildings, the precise impact of ventilation type, effectiveness and operation warrants further investigation. This study aims to examine whether reduced ventilation rates lead to a higher persistence of resistant microorganisms, and to explore both design and lifestyle to assess potential reasons why this might be the case.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D5019A27-0C3C-49B5-B540-F477EF8899B4</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c6c115b68d03.73461227</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Energy,Environment,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.hemacnetwork.com</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Registered stakeholder to NICE Guideline Consultation on Indoor Air Pollution (provided comments on Draft Scope)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D08C065D-55E4-4B87-A67B-B1A374905F6C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c6c8121f2098.03415642</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/indevelopment/gid-ng10022</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Development of new Elective on Indoor Air Quality, to be delivered as part of new part-time MSc in Environmental Architecture</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>16FBE0C3-F554-4351-AC1A-884B5E1F7A03</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c6cb005e3020.35373518</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Evidence Provided to All-Party Parliamentary Group on Healthy Homes and Buildings- December 2016</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>34B77B57-0DBC-4789-96FB-33917C60FF48</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c6cdd01f13e4.43833368</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm/cmallparty/170106/healthy-homes-and-buildings.htm</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/N006607/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C087E953-30F3-4968-B0F3-D48A5998A2B4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Civil eng. &amp; built environment</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>608431EA-925E-44D8-A1E2-8C24B4768085</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F95121C7-7C31-40CE-BDBC-1E2BF025AEA6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Energy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6723A70B-A523-40AB-9740-B6AD2A0677B7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medical &amp; health interface</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7A76A7D6-69D8-433D-A35F-0360BC814DC2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Architecture HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3A99B6E4-F520-4600-BCB0-5F054BBCFB6B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Building Ops &amp; Management</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BE7CEC14-3FA2-49BC-89EE-062447C269C1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Energy Efficiency</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>86884005-D98A-4391-95D8-913141C39F7C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environment &amp; Health</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E48C802F-8897-4353-910A-09D09331BB82</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medical science &amp; disease</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
