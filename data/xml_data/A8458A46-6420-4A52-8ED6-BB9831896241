The UK government identified robotics as a key technology that will lead us to future economic growth (tinyurl.com/q8bhcy7). They have recognised, however, that autonomous robots are complex and typically operate in ever-changing environments (tinyurl.com/o2u2ts7). How can we be confident that they perform useful functions, as required, but are safe? 

It is standard practice to use testing to check correctness and safety. The software-development practice for robotics typically includes testing within simulations, before robots are built, and then testing of the actual robots. Simulations have several benefits: we can test early, and test execution is cheaper and faster. For example, simulation does not require a robot to move physically. Testing with the real robots is, however, still needed, since we cannot be sure that a simulation captures all the important aspects of the hardware and environment.

In the current scenario, test generation is typically manual; this makes testing expensive and unreliable, and introduces delays. Manual test generation is error-prone and can lead to tests that produce the wrong verdict. If a test incorrectly states that the robot has a failure, then developers have to investigate, with extra cost and time. If a test incorrectly states that the robot behaves as expected, then a faulty system may be released. Without a systematic approach, tests may also identify infeasible environments; such tests cannot be used with the real robot. To make matters worse, manual test generation limits the number of tests produced. 

All this affects the cost and quality of robot software, and is in contrast with current practice in other safety-critical areas, like the transport industry, which is highly regulated. Translation of technology, however, is not trivial. For example, lack of a driver to correct mistakes or respond to unforeseen circumstances leads to a much larger set of working conditions for an autonomous vehicle. Another example is provided by probabilistic algorithms, which make the robot behaviour nondeterministic, and so, difficult to repeat in testing and more difficult to characterise as correct or not. 
 
We will address all these issues with novel automated test-generation techniques for mobile and autonomous robots. To use our techniques, a RoboTest tester constructs a model of the robot using a familiar notation already employed in the design of simulations and implementations. After that, instead of spending time designing simulation scenarios, the RoboTest tester, with the push of a button, generates tests. With RoboTest, testing is cheaper, since it takes less time, and is more effective, because the RoboTest tester can use many more tests, especially when using a simulation.

To execute the tests, the RoboTest tester can choose from a few simulators employing a variety of approaches to programming. Execution of the tests also follows the push of a button. Yet another button translates simulation to deployment tests. So, the RoboTest tester can trace back the results from the deployment tests to the simulation and the original model. So, the RoboTest tester is in a strong position to understand the reality gap between the simulation and the real world.

The RoboTest tester knows that the verdicts for the tests are correct, and understands what the testing achieves; for example, it can be guaranteed to find faults of an identified class. So, the RoboTest tester can answer the very difficult question: have we tested enough?

In conclusion, RoboTest will move the testing of mobile and autonomous robots onto a sound footing. RoboTest will make testing more efficient and effective in terms of person effort, and so, achieve longer term reduced costs.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The potential impact of the work we propose is far reaching, given the large number of prospective and current applications of mobile and autonomous robots. Benefit to society is going to be realised, in the longer term, via the increased safety and lower cost of the robotic systems developed with the use of our techniques. For example, autonomous vehicles can become widespread, with uses for entertainment, surveillance, defense and so on, and industrial robots can become more interactive and cooperate with humans.

In more detail, we note the following non-academic beneficiaries:

 * general public, who will have another tool to understand the abstract concepts of Computer Science and Systems Engineering;
 * developers, who will have modern tools to tackle the difficult problem of verifying robot controllers;
 * certifiers, who will have techniques for program verification, and can reasonably request from developers the artefacts that provide evidence of properties of the robot controllers, with traceability provided to link designs, simulations, and deployments;

We expect the impact on the general public to be achieved during the lifetime of the project and beyond, on developers at the end of the project, and on certifiers in the longer term. 

We note that our approach is based on state machines, a notation well accepted by engineers. In addition, we eagerly pursue automation. This addresses scalability, but also accessibility of techniques and results. Impact is, in this way, improved, from the point of view of developers and certifiers. 

The multitude of applications of robots that can become economically viable mean that, indirectly, our results can support cultural enrichment (with robots used in museums, galleries and libraries), quality of life (with robots used in domestic cleaning activities), health (with robots used in home-care setups), environmental protection (with robots used for pollution monitoring). On a more technical vein, our results can provide evidence that safety cases can be made for mobile autonomous robots. This can influence governmental and industrial guidelines both in the UK and internationally. In the case of businesses involved in robot development themselves, our results will generate the knowledge that they can use to significantly improve their validation and verification skills. With the growth expected in the market, the impact will be significant, and attract and optimise investment. 

While some of our research assistants will concentrate on the scientific foundations of the testing of robotic systems, some will have just the right skills to work in the modern robotics industry. Undergraduate and MSc students will also benefit from our results, since our demonstrators and examples can be incorporated in modules on systems engineering and robotics. 

According to market reports, the UK software industry is on the rise and is presently the second largest market by value in Europe. The UK has expertise in the development of safety-critical software in a wide number of domains. Interest in verification of cyber-physical systems in general in Europe and the US is evidenced by a recent report, on the need for EU-US collaboration in modelling and simulation for CPS (https://www.steinbeis-europa.de/files/tams4cps-srac_e-book_01-2017_1.pdf). The state-of-the-art technology that we will developed will further enhance this expertise, and help us to maintain significant international leadership. 

As a group, we have a strong track record of promoting impact of our research. This covers interaction with the general public and industry. In the group, we have a previous RAEng Enterprise Fellow, a previous RS Industry Fellow, a CEO and a Director of two spin-out companies, and a winner of a Queen's Award for Technological Achievement. This is over and above very successful academic records. We will pursue all pathways to impact available to us for RoboTest.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2022-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>610059</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R025134/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5CBA14F4-F235-45B6-A9DD-5937D5C166CC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>5</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Electrical Engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>95</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
