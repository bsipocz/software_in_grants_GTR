Occasionally mistakes occur in this complex process, which may lead to blood cancer, including acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). AML is the most common aggressive blood cancer in adults with 3000 new cases per year in the UK, and unfortunately the majority still die of their disease within 6 months of diagnosis. A better understanding of the biology of the disease is needed to improve the outcome for these patients.

AML arises as a result of multiple mistakes, or mutations, in genes that control blood production. These mutations usually occur in a step-wise manner over time in a small pool of blood stem/progenitor cells (the cells that give rise to all the blood cells we need). Recently it was discovered that some of these mutations are commonly found in the blood cells of healthy older people who do not have yet have blood cancer. These mutations appear to make the cells grow more than is normal, so that over time they dominate the bone marrow (where blood is produced), and increase the risk of developing blood cancers in the future.

The most common of these mutations occur in genes which control &amp;quot;epigenetic&amp;quot; marks on the DNA. Epigenetic marks do not affect the DNA sequence, but can contribute to disease as they control how genes are switched on and off. 

In this project, we are studying how mutations in these epigenetic regulators turn normal blood stem cells into abnormal &amp;quot;preleukaemic&amp;quot; cells that can go on to cause AML. We aim to find out which blood cells get the mutations and which pathways in these cells make them grow abnormally.

To do this, we will be studying blood cells from healthy human volunteers who have donated bone marrow samples obtained during hip or knee operations, from patients with AML and in mice with one of the mutations. Our experiments will help us to work out how the mutations change the way cells behave and what genes are switched on and off abnormally. We will then use this knowledge to try to find a pathway that can be blocked to stop the cells growing.

This research is important for two reasons. Firstly, it will give us a better understanding of how AML and other blood cancers develop. Secondly, we hope that it will identify a way to kill the preleukaemic cells to prevent leukaemia before it fully develops, and to improve treatment for patients with AML.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Recently it has been shown that clonal haematopoiesis associated with somatic mutations is common in elderly individuals. The majority of mutations occur in genes encoding three epigenetic regulators, DNMT3A, TET2 and ASXL1, and notably mutations in the same genes are initiating events in the development of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Acquisition of one of these mutations in a haematopoietic stem or progenitor cell leads to clonal expansion and increases the risk of haematological cancer, though blood cell production is not impaired.

This project aims to determine the molecular and cellular mechanisms that lead to clonal advantage in the development of myeloid malignancies. To identify the cell type which propagates this state, we will characterise primary human bone marrow samples from elderly adults with clonal haematopoiesis, and from patients with AML in disease remission. In parallel, a mouse model with an inducible Dnmt3a-R882H allele will be developed, that will allow mutant haematopoietic cells to be fate-mapped in situ. We will determine the phenotypic consequences of mutations in purified haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells - this will involve assays of proliferation, self-renewal, differentiation and lineage potential - and study how the epigenetic and transcriptional profile is altered in order to identify genes that are dysregulated in mutant cells. Comparing results from human and murine cells will allow common pathways in equivalent cell types to be identified. A shRNA dropout screen will be developed to test which of these pathways are critical to driving clonal advantage.

This study will shed light on how myeloid malignancies develop, and provide general insights into cancer development and stem cell ageing. By elucidating the mechanisms underlying clonal advantage, we hope to identify a therapeutic target that would allow eradication of dominant preleukaemic clones prior to the development of fully transformed leukaemia.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our project is likely to benefit the following groups:

Academic community: As described in the Academic Beneficiaries section, scientists working in haematopoiesis, haematological malignancies and cancer more broadly, epigenetics and stem cell biology will benefit directly from our findings, potentially opening new avenues for research. Furthermore, our mouse model may demonstrate a new way to study the impact of acquired mutations in vivo, providing a valuable asset for the community.

Patients, patient groups and clinicians: Mutations in the DNMT3A gene occur in approximately 25% of cases of acute myeloid leukaemia, as well as a significant proportion of myelodysplasia and aggressive lymphomas. A key aim of this project is to identify how these mutations in increase the likelihood of malignancy. We hope our research will lead to identification of targetable pathological mechanisms to allow rational design of specific and effective treatments. We will communicate our findings during the project, through public engagement activities, However, direct therapeutic benefit could take a decade or more based on prior exemplars of translational candidates.

Commercial sector: Epigenetic therapy is an active area of interest for pharmaceutical companies in many cancers. For example, hypomethylating agents, such as Azacitadine and Decitibine have been approved for the treatment of myeloid malignancies. More recently, oral mutant IDH protein inhibitors have entered clinical practice. In investigating how mutations in epigenetic regulators lead to clonal advantage, our research can inform the development of more specific and effective epigenetic treatments.

Health sector and wider society: Early intervention in cancer is a medical, social and economic priority as it reduces morbidity, mortality and the economic cost of later stage disease both by direct reduction of treatment costs and reduced loss of economic productivity. While it would be premature to genetically screen healthy populations for preleukaemic haematopoietic clones currently (due to the low positive predictive value for development of cancer), further research may allow us to risk-stratify patients, at high risk of developing haematological cancer. This research may therefore open up a new field of preventative haematology, benefiting patients and reducing the societal economic impact of blood cancers. Progress here will require translational and epidemiological studies, so the timeframe for recouping benefit will again be a decade or longer.

Research councils and charities: This project will provide new data on areas within myeloid malignancies and cancer epigenetics, areas of active research within the UK and internationally. It will therefore help to inform future applications for basic and translational research.

Research staff: The fellowship offers an excellent opportunity for the applicant and other staff involved in the project to develop new skills. Specifically, the applicant will acquire skills in state-of-the-art laboratory techniques, including immunophenotypic cell sorting, single-cell molecular analysis, bisulphite sequencing, ATAC-seq, genome engineering and bioinformatics. More general scientific skills will also be learnt, such as experimental design, data analysis and statistical assessment, and critical interpretation and presentation of results, which will be directly transferable to future scientific and clinical work. These skills will be invaluable throughout the applicant's future career as a clinician scientist, enabling him to bridge the gap between clinical medicine and basic science. Such benefits will assist potential researchers in the future, particularly clinicians in a similar position to the proposer.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-10-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-10-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>254101</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/R002258/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
