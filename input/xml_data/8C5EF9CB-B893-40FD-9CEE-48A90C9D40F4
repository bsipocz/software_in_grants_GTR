home, in care homes and care providers. This has demonstrated the benefits of remote face to
face support, most recently using the new ?v-connect? video service. The user interface is a
key in reducing barriers to adoption of any new technology. During the development
significant testing went into the design of the user interface, particularly the use of the
person?s own TV, although we recognised that this was not necessarily appropriate for people
with substantive cognitive impairment. In a parallel piece of work, Designability undertook
an EPSRC funded project, called InTouch, that examined the use of video by people with
cognitive impairment. Considerable learning and understanding was derived from that project
regarding the development of user interfaces that overcome the limitations of cognitive
impairment. There is therefore strong synergy between the inTouch project and the v-connect
service to facilitate remote care.
There are significant numbers of people with cognitive impairments, such as learning
difficulties, brain injury and dementia, who are potential beneficiaries of video consultation
services. Individuals with these conditions have significant medication and other care needs,
they are also at risk of concomitant conditions or co-morbidities and are often unable to travel.
A service that combines the learning of the inTouch with the v-connect service has the
potential to bring remote care to this more technologically difficult to reach demographic.
This project will explore the market for the inTouch interface, integrated into the v-connect
service. This will involve consideration of the needs of care providers and users, with
commissioners reaction to the new proposition, balanced against the scope and cost of
integrating the user interface and service. This project will provide objective evidence of
whether there is a market for this integrated solution.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74"><gtr:id>E18E2F0F-AC7D-4E02-9559-669F7C8FEC74</gtr:id><gtr:name>Innovate UK</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>21279</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">700562</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
