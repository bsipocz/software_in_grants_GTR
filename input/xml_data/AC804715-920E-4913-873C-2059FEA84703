Indeed, many mitigation measures are focussed upon the transport change, and many mitigation measures are focussed upon the transport sector. However, FUTURENET recognizes that climate change also has an impact on transport. This impact has two dimensions: an engineering dimension derived from the interaction between climate design, weather events and the physical network, and a socio-economic dimension derived from the interaction between weather and climate and the patterns of transport demand. FUTURENET integrates both in assessing the future resilience of the UK transport system. This interdisciplinary approach will assist stakeholders in adapting the transport network and increasing resilience of critical transport infrastructure. Specifically FUTURENET seeks to develop a number of scenarios for how the transport system in the UK might look in 2050, and will investigate the resilience of each of these scenarios to the effects of climate change. The investigation will be carried out through the five work packagesa) WP1- The development of possible UK transport scenarios for 2050, through detailed literature surveys and the results of a number of expert workshops.b) WP2 - Identification of route corridor for study and development of an inventory of infrastructure that covers the complete range of infrastructure for the chosen route.c) WP3 - Models of the failure modes of transport systems, which will identify existing models and thresholds for the effects of climate on transport systems, and will develop new models where there are gaps in knowledge.d) WP4- Model development and application, which will develop an overarching model framework that will combine the models identified in WP3 with climate change scenarios and the transport scenarios outlined in WP1, to enable the resilience of different types of transport network to be evaluated.e) WP5 - Generic Tools and Dissemination, through which the results of the project will be made available in an accessible form to a wide variety of stakeholders, and the model of WP4 made available for application to other route corridors.FUTURENET brings together a wide variety of academic expertise spanning the engineering, environmental and social sciences, together with a diverse group of stakeholders in the transport industry. It has the potential both to develop a deeper understanding of the underlying science on the effects of climate change on transport systems and to provide information and useful tools on how such systems can be made more resilient.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>95836</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>BGS information products and assessment methods further developed and integrated into Network Rail / Highways England procedures.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>0D5B2EFC-A1AA-4278-A677-7DEBBEC90552</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56c2e5042f2fd9.41669515</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The concept of 'resilience' was explored from the perspectives of travellers, network managers and policy makers. Resilience was defined using a metric comparing actual journey time vs expected journey time. An assessment method was developed that incorporated a range of hazards causing a loss of transport service and associated travel disruptions including: i. direct climate hazards (rainfall, flooding), ii. climate-induced hazards on the road/track (rutting, buckling) and geohazards (shrink-swell, landslides). A suite of physical process models for different extreme weather-related effects on transport networks, were developed and can be used in future projects to improve infrastructure asset management.
This was integrated into a methodology for determining the resilience of large scale transport networks. Case studies demonstrated how travel disruption propagates across rail network connections following a specific event (such as flooding or landslide), causing delays across the country, which could be used to inform travellers and to optimise travel plans. Its application will help identify strategic transport resilience and prioritise future investment.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The FutureNet assessment framework is being used on the current iSMART project (EP/K027050/1).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5E32FC53-384E-4A6F-AC84-5A92B20E353A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-9123205299.603943775a82f2</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Environment,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.arcc-network.org.uk/project-summaries/futurenet/#.VsLnZvmLRQI</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A04BC861-62CB-4196-BAC8-5F12027E248F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Aged embankment imaging and assessment using surface waves</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers - Forensic Engineering</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/71a704d5febd6a2c5b989f5e41ed20ff"><gtr:id>71a704d5febd6a2c5b989f5e41ed20ff</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gunn D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a953e9b5a4312.57064792</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>0D95A6C2-FCC4-41B6-A5C5-DA44066C6D58</gtr:id><gtr:title>Forecasting infrastructure resilience to climate change</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers - Transport</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/3b8b819a72c072f8b8e57be0cc61abb1"><gtr:id>3b8b819a72c072f8b8e57be0cc61abb1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dijkstra T</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56c2f5f5e1f5b9.43804930</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/G060355/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>748617DE-4AB0-42C9-9514-B22ECFBE05E1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Transport Ops &amp; Management</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
