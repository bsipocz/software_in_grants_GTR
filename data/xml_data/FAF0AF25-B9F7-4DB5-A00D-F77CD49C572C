For example, little is known about how Amazon is able to tailor advertisements and recommend products that are actually interesting for potential online customers, or how Facebook decides which news Facebook users may be more inclined to read. All the mechanisms that support this filtering of information and products is obscure and internet users would like to know more about it, such as possible bias in their behaviour and, more importantly, have some control over these recommender systems.

This project aims to closely work with young people to further understand how aware 'digital natives' are about algorithm bias, their attitudes and main concerns and recommendations when interacting with such systems. This information will help us to better understand the way young people interact with such systems and identify youth-led solutions for teaching critical thinking toward digital information systems. We will apply different engagement tools and methodologies including focus groups, workshops and youth 'juries' to facilitate discussion, reflection and a deeper understanding of youth online behaviour and youth-lead software solutions.

Relevant for this project is the development of 'fairer' algorithms with young people or non-experts as well as with experts. To do that, we intend to run a series of hackathons or workshops in which expert programmers and young people will work together to produce and evaluate new fairer algorithms that will produce more transparent and less creepy outputs. We will also run an 'ethicon'; an innovative approach in which scientists and ethicists work together to produce ethically justifiable algorithm design. During this process the project will be able to identify a series of principles that will contribute to the development of a platform that will allow users to have more control over the existing online filtering systems. In other words, this project will provide citizens with the skills and tools to better judge when and how much to trust the information they are given, understand the digital identity that algorithms create from user's personal data as well as protecting the users' privacy and online security.

This project will provide policy recommendations, ethical guidelines and a 'fairness toolkit' co-produced with young people and other stakeholders that will include educational materials and resources co-designed to support youth understanding about online environments as well as raise awareness among online providers about the concerns and rights of young internet users. This project is relevant for young people as well as society as a whole to ensure trust and transparency are not missing from the internet. 

The results will be widely disseminated to a variety of audiences ranging from academic peer-review journals to community groups of interest such as secondary schools and youth clubs.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>*General Public:*
The public is at the centre of this project from the initial co-design of scenarios/tasks, through the 'Youth Juries' workshops and focus group sessions that map public concerns, to co-design Hackathons and prototype evaluation sessions. 

Educational materials produced as part of the project will be made available to educators, guardians and other stakeholders. These materials will help to empower citizens with skills and tools to reflect upon the behaviour of social media algorithms so that they will be better positioned to know which online services to trust, manage their online identity and privacy and be more secure from unwanted manipulation.

In addition workshop with young people, their guardians and educators, the project will also include dedicated public engagement and communications activities, such as presentations associated at:
- ESRC Research Methods Festival.
- ESRC Festival of Social Science.
- Nesta's Future Fest [futurefest.org], a weekend dedicated to &amp;quot;radical ideas, compelling talks and immersive experiences to inspire, excite and challenge perceptions of the future&amp;quot;.
- MozFest in London, an annual hackathon organized by the Mozilla foundation.

*Policy-makers:*
Our findings regarding the cumulative impact of filtering/recommender algorithms on users will be communicated to the Information Commissioner's Office, to facilitate evidence based policy review related to the UK Data Protection Act's 'principle 6' on the &amp;quot;protection of individuals against having significant decisions made about them by wholly automated mean&amp;quot;.
A report on teaching critical inquiry of algorithm mediated information will be prepared for presentation to the minister for internet safety and security for contributing towards evidence based policy making.
A report, summarizing our findings on subjective experiences of algorithm 'fairness' and related design guidelines for 'fair' information control algorithms will be produced for industry bodies, to support the development of improved industry guidelines on transparency and responsible innovation.

*Industry:*
There will be a series of workshops for software developers and service providers to encourage thinking about implicit and explicit biases that may affect information control algorithms. It is the hope that these workshops will stimulate innovations that will boost the reputation of the UK Digital Economy as leader in trustworthy, reliable systems.
The project will tap into an existing network of over 200 commercial partners at the Horizon Digital Economy Research institute to disseminate findings and encourage participation in relevant events. One route to engagement with SMEs will be through Continuing Professional Development workshops. Efforts will be particularly focused on sectors where understanding human behaviour and 'fair' unbiased information provision is business-critical, such as market analysis and product evaluation.
Beyond the immediate benefits to citizens, the outcomes will also contribute towards a fairer digital economy by helping to expose anticompetitive practices that might be embedded in algorithm behaviours and which harm SMEs especially.

*Third Sector:*
The educational materials produced by this project will be made available to support programmes by NGOs and Charities, like the Mozilla foundation, in teaching young people how to develop critically inquiring attitudes towards digital systems. Starting from the first year the project will engage with these organizations as an important part of the stakeholders workshops.
The 'Youth Juries' workshops will build on existing links between the Horizon Digital Economy Research institute and the iRights coalition which promotes the rights of young people online.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1140593</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>UnBias Youth Jury at the Explorers Fair (Festival of Science and Curiosity, Nottingham)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9CEE779A-377A-47CD-B164-6917031A91F5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>30 young people attended the youth jury at the Broadway cinema, Nottingham.

The event was a sell out with 300 attending and created much interest on social media. 
The workshop considered the legal, social and technical dimensions of algorithms and their role in governance. As our everyday lives are more and more determined by decisions made by automated algorithmic processes, the status of algorithms and how they can be regulated , queried and countermanded, becomes evermore important. To give just a few examples, algorithms now often determine how we are assessed as risks for policing and terrorism surveillance: how we get hired, fired and promoted; and what news and political opinion we are exposed to. Both personal and societal welfare and arguably, the future of democracy itself, thus depend on being able to regulate and make accountable the algorithm society. In particular a major current question is if a right to explanation of what an algorithm has decided exists in data protection law? Lilian spoke on this in her contribution: &amp;quot;&amp;quot;Slave to the Algorithm: War Stories and Legal Remedies&amp;quot;.
We hope the event will be a &amp;quot;starter seed&amp;quot; for CILP and partners (including Edinburgh and Horizon DEC, Nottingham) to investigate this fascinating topic further and we will be seeking major grant funding. ax 120000 characters)</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c6c47b9cf291.24103827</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.strath.ac.uk/humanities/lawschool/newsevents/algorithmworkshopfebruary2017/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Flamenco-Yoga as creative practice for mutual recovery.

To date, the blog has attracted more than 5,000 views and over 400 subscribers. During the last year, the CaSMa blog has posted more than 70 blogs, received many comments from followers (n&amp;gt;39) and several requests for guest posts (e.g. World Wide Web Foundation (webfoundation.org).
The blog is a valuable tool to publicize events, showcase current research projects and inform the public about current topics on social media research as well as provide a platform for the public to engage and communicate with the CaSMa team. For example, after the last public engagement event organised at Nottingham Contemporary, one of the attendees posted:

'Hello, I attended the most recent event. The event was organised masterfully and conducted with the utmost dignity and professionalism yet remained safe, supportive, engaging and thought provoking, it was &amp;quot;real&amp;quot;.

At the end of the debate I posed the question, &amp;quot;is the emerging phenomenon of digital interaction a window into Jung's collective unconscious.&amp;quot; This could be refined into a debate/exploration of virtual social groups and crowd consensus or dissension on the internet and perhaps their effects on the physical world.

please email me if you for further thoughts.'

Evidence that the CaSMa blog is reaching policy makers is evident from two occasions:
On December 7th 2015, following a blog post regarding the House of Lords inquiry into online platforms we were contacted:
Dear Dr Koene,
 I just noticed your short blog on the Lords inquiry into online platforms, particularly commenting on the question relating to algorithms.
Would you care to respond to our inquiry, on that one question? You clearly have a lot of expertise in this area. A page or two would be sufficient and would certainly enrich the debate.
The only issue is that we will stop accepting submissions on the 10th of this month.
Nevertheless, given that you have already more or less written it
Best,

On January 5th 2016, following blog posts on the draft Investigative Powers Bill we were contacted:
Dear Ansgar,
I work with the team leading on the Investigatory Powers Bill in the Home Office.
I hope you don't mind my approach, but we saw that you'd produced an analysis of the IP Bill on the CaSMa project blog site, and wondered if you might be interested in an informal discussion with officials working on the Bill. This could either be in London, or via phone if that were more convenient.
If you are interested in setting something up please do get in touch.
Best regards
Rebecca

Sessions involved hands-on exercises where students, working in pairs, compared results obtained when using different browsers and/or search engines. Participants engaged and discussed about their online preferences and/or concerns regarding: algorithm bias, filtering systems, fairness and privacy issues.

At the end of the sessions, networking with teachers led to establish links with schools to promote other current research activities within our research team (e.g., UnBias Youth Juries). Also, this activity contributed to develop strong links with the organisers of the Science and Curiosity Festival, which takes place annually in Nottingham, and to express our interest to take part in future events.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b42dc846f0e1.69811920</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://unbias.wp.horizon.ac.uk/event/explorers-fair-expo/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Gem FM radio interview</gtr:description><gtr:form>A broadcast e.g. TV/radio/film/podcast (other than news/press)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6623FC86-6265-4597-BA4B-3E89D28F10E8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I was interviewed by Gem FM about the work I did bringing yoga into children homes</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b98c517f5dc7.21258601</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Children's and Young People's Rights in the Digital Age: An IAMCR 2016 pre-conference</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>44D5B22C-C66E-4487-9D6A-99A6D22DFCFF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Are children's rights being newly infringed or enhanced in the digital age? Such questions concern researchers, child rights' advocates, and internet governance experts. Yet children's needs and experiences in the digital age are often neglected in high-level debates about global internet provision and governance and children's rights are treated as a minority interest and seen as demanding exceptional treatment from adult society. Further, current debates frequently emphasise the risks children potentially face online and underline their right to protection, but much less attention is gven to children's provision and participation rights online.

The conference will foster an international debate on key issues related to children's and young people's rights in the digital age, including: child and youth participation rights; online opportunities and risks; inequalities and digital exclusion; policy and multi-stakeholder governance; the role of peers and peer culture; participatory research; e-learning, health promotion and creativity in the digital environment; cross-generational dynamics of online engagement.
The conference includes a plenary presentation from Global Kids Online. It will begin at midday on 26 July and close at midday on 27 July to enable delegates to make the journey to Leicester for the opening of IAMCR 2016 (approximately one-hour train journey).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>589b2e87b452c6.43109344</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Third sector organisations</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.lse.ac.uk/media@lse/events/CYPR-IAMCR-2016.aspx</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>It is too early to provide a summary but these are the areas we anticipate this project will have an impact:
