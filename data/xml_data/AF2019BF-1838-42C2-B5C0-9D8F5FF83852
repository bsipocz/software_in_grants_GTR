&lt;p>First, the project will re-examine the logic of collective action, assessing the impact of reduced communication and coordination costs; the changing nature of leadership; and the effects of different information environments on propensity to participate in political mobilisation. This part of the research will involve conducting laboratory and field experiments into online behaviour.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Second, the research will develop the Digital-era Governance model for newer 'Web 2.0' applications and other technological developments such as cloud computing. The research will re-examine the nature of citizen-government interactions in this changing environment, examining the impact of Internet-based mediation on information exchange, organisational forms in government and citizen participation in policy-making. This part of the research will involve a comparison of government's online presence in eight countries, using webmetric techniques, and in-depth qualitative analysis of governance models, using elite interviewing and documentary analysis.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>429336</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>mySociety</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>mySociety</gtr:description><gtr:id>68AA7DCB-51DF-4FE1-8ECC-A3B8307BB484</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We have now applied for further funding through the ESRC programme: Civil Society Data Partnership Projects, in which mySociety will provide access to data, and we will jointly design experiments to test various hyotheses about the effect of different kinds of social information on people's willingness to undertake civic engagement.

Her presentation &amp;quot;Social Media and Political Turbulence&amp;quot; sparked questions and discussion. The abstract was as follows:

The last few years have seen increasingly frenzied speculation about the role of social media in political mobilisation. In an important recent book Helen Margetts and her colleagues report on research drawing on large-scale data generated from the Internet and real-world events to show how mobilisations that succeed are unpredictable, unstable and often unsustainable. To reach a better understanding of this unruly force in the political world, the researchers have used experiments that test how social media influence citizens when they are deciding whether or not to participate. They conclude that a new kind of &amp;quot;chaotic pluralism&amp;quot; is the model of democracy that is emerging in our networked environment.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c048c5953601.83661241</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.crassh.cam.ac.uk/events/26748</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation at Computational Social Science Conference (Warwick)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DCC0E6A6-0157-4C56-8E9D-FBE1E9E821DB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Helen Margetts was invited to give a talk to the Warwick Business School Computational Social Science Conference in Warwick, 11-12th June 2014. Her presentation Building Data Science into Policy Design? (one of the key developing themes of the Award research) was well received and attracted discussion and interest afterwards.

The conference brought together researchers across the social sciences, the natural sciences and engineering to share perspectives and identify opportunities to gain new insights into human behaviour and decision making, again a key developing theme of the research programme. So discussion with other conference participants and speakers from disciplines well outside the normal scope of a social science conference has led to further possibilities for collaboration, for example with Felix Reed Tsochas, University of Oxford.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5464b414eefac6.45654099</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academic audiences (collaborators, peers etc.)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://seen.co/event/computational-social-science-conference-coventry-uk-2014-8712/search/helenmargetts</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Participation in World Economic Forum Future of Government panel</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7A5407A8-D026-4D18-8753-619282939961</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Helen Margetts participated in a panel on 'The Future of Government' - on 19th May 2014 at the Blavatnik School of Government.

Social media are now inextricably intertwined with the political behaviour of ordinary citizens. As people go about their daily lives on an ever-changing cast of web-based platforms, they are invited to make 'micro-donations' of time and effort to political causes: liking, sharing, tweeting, retweeting, following, uploading, downloading, signing petitions and so on, which extend the ladder of participation at the lower end and draw new people into politics, particularly in younger age groups. These 'tiny acts' of political participation can scale up to large mobilizations. The overwhelming majority fail, but some succeed rapidly and dramatically through a series of chain reactions and tipping points.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c048fc6d2f55.74227473</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://politicalturbulence.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/59/2016/04/websci16.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>10th Memorial Lecture for Paul Hirst</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>54D1370A-418B-4F41-94C0-84C37A480BEC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I was invited to give the 10th memorial lecture in honour of my late colleague at Birkbeck College, the social theorist Paul Hirst. The organizers of the event had heard about my work for the Award on the subject of 'Chaotic Pluralism' (the title of the book that lays out the findings of the Collective Action element of the research) and thought this would be an excellent subject for the 10th memorial lecture, as Paul Hirst was a reknowned neo-pluralist, particularly through his work on the concept of Associationalism and the book Associatative Democracy. This took place on the 11th February 2014.

The talk was warmly received and further generated discussion on the subject of the book, and the theoretical development of the Award, informing the final stages of developing the manuscript and making deeper links between our work and that of the earlier pluralists (such as Paul Hirst), something the first reviewers of the book had urged us to consider.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>54638a93a61a42.06549014</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talk at QS2: Understanding the patterns of success in online petitioning</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A4C84C93-2FD8-44D4-823F-F20487D2A3F7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The presentation has been well received and further discussions were conducted during the event.

The conference was convened by Helen Margetts as Editor in Chief of the journal Policy and Internet, in collaboration with the Internet and Politics Standing Group of the European Consortium of Political Science. It was organized by the Oxford Internet Institute. Keynote speakers were Nigel Shadbolt and Duncan Watts.

The event led to numerous discussions and collaborations, including some of the outputs specified for this award, including two policy events on big data held in Boston in 2013 and Washington in 2014. It also led to publications - a special issue of the journal Policy and Internet, as well as numerous articles of key relevance to the project - all conference paper givers were invited to submit to the journal, and most did.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r_87242532972b43630c</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:presentationType>workshop facilitator</gtr:presentationType><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://ipp.oii.ox.ac.uk/2012</gtr:url><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Convened Internet, Politics and Policy Conference 2014</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F325AD4F-2B3B-4A94-8995-567C8CA64664</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Helen Margetts (together with Jonathan Bright, another member of the research team) convened the third Internet, Politics and Policy conference, organized by the Oxford Internet Institute, on behalf of the journal Policy and Internet, to discuss a key trend in the relationship between the internet and public policy - the theme of the 2014 conference was Crowdsourcing.

It generated cutting edge discussion on the theme of collective action and social media, and the sharing of results, methodological development and data sources.

The workshop generated high level discussions that endured far beyond the week of the workshop, and fed directly into the work of Helen Margetts' professorial fellowship, particularly on the theme of Collective Action - the subject of her forthcoming book with Peter John, Scott Hale and Taha Yasseri.

(1) Growing and shaping the field of social data science in the UK, through capacity building, training and the creation of new data sources. 
 By focusing on large-scale digitally generated data on citizen behaviour, the Fellowship proposal laid out the concept of big data before the term existed and allowed Helen Margetts as professorial fellow to be an early mover in shaping the nascent field of 'social data science'. The fellowship research has developed new ways of generating and analyzing large-scale social data and new 'data science' methodologies for using this real-time transactional data to understand political behaviour, developed and showcased in the book Political Turbulence published with Princeton University Press. 
 Over the course of the research programme, the research has built capacity in data science, particularly with the appointment of Scott Hale (in 2011), Taha Yasseri (in 2012) and the DPhil studentship of Tom Nicholls, all of whom have gone on to develop careers in the field and continue to further the aims of the research programme. The research attracted other faculty to the Oxford Internet Institute including Dr Jonathan Bright (in 2013) who has joined the core research team in various collaborations. The research has also led to the provision of various data driven courses (including digital social research; visualization; and coding with Python to gather social data from the Internet) to the OII MSc in the Social Science of the Internet, which is now being developed to include a data science track. The statistics core of the MSc degree has also been reworked to use R, a core tool in the field of data science.
 Largely as a result of developing social data science at OII, Helen Margetts is one of the three Oxford leads for the new Alan Turing Institute for Data Science, a government-funded initiative being established in London (the other partners are Cambridge, UCL, Warwick and Edinburgh) and has played a pivotal role in ensuring that social data science is on the ATI's research agenda. As part of the nascent scientific programme of the ATI, she is convening the workshop on 'The Foundations of Social Data Science'; these workshops are expected to lead to a programme of research in the future, thereby ensuring that social data science is an enduring core theme of the ATI. She is also convening an EPSRC-funded Summit on 'Data Science for Policy and Government' to take place in London in February 2015, which will draw in policy-makers and practitioners from across government with an interest in data science, to ensure that ATI research informs and benefits government and public policy as well as other sectors. 
 The research has opened up new data sources for political science research, including a complete dataset of all signatures to all petitions on the US and UK government petition sites; the network of hyperlinks between pages in the .uk domain from 1996 to 2010 based on data from the Internet Archive; and a huge variety of social media data (as detailed under 'Research Databases and Models). The fellowship enabled the collection of a complete dataset of tweets and public facebook posts for the UK general election in 2015, including all mentions of all candidates and all their own activity on Twitter. These data were initially analysed for an election blog http://elections.oii.ox.ac.uk/ and the research team are now liaising with the British Election Study team (Rachel Gibson and Jane Green) to work out how this data might be linked with the relevant BES data and used by other electoral researchers.

(2) Raising awareness of and demonstrating the potential of 'big data' and data science for government, policy-making and service design, with specific examples where methods have been used directly. 
 Social data science has distinctive potential for the public sector - yet government lags behind the corporate world in obtaining benefits from 'big data' or data science methods. As detailed in the outputs of the fellowship, Helen Margetts has highlighted the challenge and opportunities of big data and data science for government to policy-makers across the world, including in London, Washington DC, Singapore, Brussels, and the World Economic Forum in Davos. The Cabinet Office have also sought access to this work, visiting the research team in Oxford and recruiting Helen Margetts to the Data Science Working Group of the Cabinet Office, which shares examples of best practice. Scott Hale is the first external member to attend and present at the newly established Government Social Research Working Group for Social Media Research, a cross-department Government initiative to promote the use of social media research for research and policy, which has also led to his advisory role with the Food Standards Agency in this area.
 More specifically, the research has fed directly into the design of the UK government petitions platform though working with the Office of the Leader of the House of Commons; staff from the Government Digital Service; and the House of Commons Procedure Committee (as listed on ResearchFish), informing design of the new petitions platform introduced after the election in 2015. This work has highlighted the importance of platform design for civic participation and developed new methodologies (including a natural experiment) for researching those impacts (John et al, 2014).
 Similar data and methods have now been used by other departments to inform service delivery design. The research team carried out a feasibility study for the UK Department of Work and Pensions on how social media may be mined to understand how citizens experience government services and policy-making, and to inform future design, which was published by the Department (see Bright et al, 2014) and presented by both Jonathan Bright and Helen Margetts to DWP analysts. This report has attracted attention in other departments and governments and was presented to civil servants in the Netherlands (2012), Cambridge (2015), and Brussels (2015). Helen Margetts is now working (through her role on the Universal Credit Evaluation Group Advisory Panel) on designing experiments to test the impact of alternative benefits calculators on employment outcomes under Universal Credit as it is rolled out.
 
(3) Raising the profile of digital technologies in government and putting forward a new model of digital governance
 Finally, work on a new model of 'Essentially Digital Governance' which lays out four 'choice' principles and five 'do principles has attracted widespread interest from policy-makers across the world, including from the Ministry of Defence (presented to over 300 senior army personnel in Tidworth in 2015); Hong Kong; Dublin and Singapore. This work has been imported into the UK government through Helen Margetts' role as a Digital Adviser to the UK government and more specifically through a series of Digital Masterclasses on the Digital Landscape that she has given to civil servants (Grade 7 and above) in 2014 and 2015, which have highlighted the possibilities of using social big data and put forward the new model for digital government (93% of participants at these sessions have said they would be more effective at work as a result). Use by policy-makers across the world has been facilitated through her appointment to the World Economic Forum Global Agenda Council on the Future of Government, including attending WEF Global Agenda Summit in Dubai (2014) and Abu Dhabi (2015) has further raised profile of the model in the international policy-making community. This work will be published as a book entitled 'Designing Essentially Digital Governance' (with Patrick Dunleavy, under contract to Oxford University Press), the proposal for which received excellent reviews, one of which (by a policy-maker) highly recommended the book for publication because of its potential value to policy-makers, particularly its global comparative reach.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>6BA87A4C-F644-4D2B-8F49-50DE9935BD7C</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>55f2d6d4893615.50690401</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This research fellowship had two areas of investigation - political participation and governance - and four research objectives, achieved as follows:

1. To contribute to knowledge and understanding of the impact of the Internet on political behaviour and governance models

We have explored the ways in which the Internet and social media are causing political mobilization to become more turbulent and chaotic. We show how social media alter the costs and benefits of political action and enable 'tiny acts' of political participation, which may seem insignificant-but can scale up to large-scale mobilization. Many-indeed most-of these mobilizations fail within hours. But we find that those that succeed do so rapidly, attaining critical mass and tipping over into large-scale participation. We have explored experimentally two key forms of social influence acting on individuals considering whether to contribute these micro-donations of time and effort to political causes; social information about the participation of others and visibility. We find visibility to be a stronger influence in terms of maximising contributions, while social information is more efficient in delivering public goods. We identify personality as a predictor of contributions; of willingness to 'start' a mobilization and of susceptibility to these forms of influence. We show how success of collective action is dependent on the distribution of individual thresholds for action, extending work by Schelling and Granovetter on threshold models. This new ecology of mobilization, with a large number of failures, a small number of extreme events, and heterogeneous behaviour within social groups brings an unstable, unpredictable, and turbulent form of politics. 

Turbulent politics pose a challenge to models of governance. Disruptive, unpredictable and often unsustainable political movements can disrupt and even destroy regimes, but fail to supply the organizational framework to rebuild them. Understanding the relationship between social media and political participation, using the kind of methods used here-experimental and the modelling of fine-grained big data-can help to inform governmental responses. An understanding of patterns of communication or interaction in data generated from social media could provide early warning signals for turbulent politics while experiments can be used to develop policies that nudge citizens' behaviours towards socially optimal outcomes

2. To develop new theories and conceptual frameworks to study citizens and governments online

For collective action we have developed a model of democracy to accommodate the changing nature of turbulent politics. A pluralist pattern is emerging, but far more disorganized and 'bottom up' than envisaged by the early architects of pluralist political systems. We call this model chaotic pluralism, building on scientific models of chaos theory in natural systems. Chaotic systems (of which turbulence is just one example) are dynamical systems characterised by non-linearity and a high degree of interconnectivity, with unpredictable behaviour in the long-term although their governing rules are known and deterministic. The embedding of daily life into a super connected world of online social media with very low (tending to zero) participation costs could have brought political systems to a chaotic state, where small perturbations or micro-contributions can eventually lead to large social phenomena. At the same time, social media and digital transactional trails can be of help in modelling the real current state of the system more precisely, helping to understand the long term behaviour of the system. 

We have developed a model of governance for the age of social media and big data-Essentially Digital Governance-based on nine principles. Five 'Do' principles provide a design framework:
? Deliver public services for free
? Use already existing digital information
? Do it once 
? Grow scalable services in competition
? Isocratic (DIY) administration
 Four 'Choice' principles offer a normative framework:
? Value equality of outcome over process
? Provide formal rights and real redress
? 'Keep the state nodal' obligation 
? Experiential learning
For each principle, the model draws out their cultural origins from the world of information theory and science that has grown up around information systems and the Internet; highlights exemplars of best and worst practice; and illustrates the counterfactual - the dangers of not pursuing them. The model provides a framework for their synthesis in a 'whole of government' approach. 

3. To develop new ways of using the Internet to generate real-time data about citizen behaviour online

We have pioneered the generation of large-scale data sources (so called 'big data') of political participation. These include a complete data set of all signatures to petitions to petitions platforms in the UK and US over a three-year period, and a complete digital trace of all these petitions in social media. For government, we have produced complete web crawls for several governments, which will be visualized and available online. We have also worked with the Internet Archive and British Library to secure access to historic crawls of both the UK and US governments, although the varying completeness of these crawls makes empirical investigations difficult.

4. To develop methodologies for studying online political behaviour

We have pioneered the use of big data and multi-disciplinary data science approaches based on large-scale real-time transactional data (the original application was prescient in proposing the use of big data before the term was coined) to the study of political behavior, modeling data using a 'socio-physics' approach to understand the rise and fall of collective attention. 

We have developed the experimental method for understanding online political behaviour, including a natural experiment provided by a sudden change to a petition platform (showing the potential for the Internet itself to be used as a laboratory); an experiment conducted remotely to show how custom-built interfaces can take the laboratory into the field; and a public goods game laboratory experiment showing how online simulated environments can overcome some of the external validity problems associated with laboratory experiments. 

These findings will be published in Political Turbulence: How Social Media Shape Collective Action (Princeton University Press, 2015) and Essentially Digital Government: Designing the Information State (Oxford University Press, forthcoming) as well as the outputs available on Researchfish.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>For political participation and collective action, the book Political Turbulence: How Social Media Shape Collective Action is an important addition to current thinking on the relationship between collective action and the internet. The research has led to a range of outputs as described elsewhere in Research Fish which have added empirical data, methodological innovation and a theoretical framework for the study of collective action online which are brought together in the book. It has been reviewed in Science, Political Studies and the Times Higher Education Supplement, as well as being presented at the Hay Festival, the Oxford Literatary Festival, at Harvard, MIT and ETH Zurich and to a number of policy-making audiences (including the Ministry of Defence), as well as being featured on the BBC Radio 4 flagship discussion programme Start the Week. The fellowship has pioneered the use of 'big data' and data science approaches and the use of multi-disciplinary teams in political science research, and Helen Margetts has raised the profile of this kind of research through numerous speaking engagements in both academic and practioner contexts - research groups across the world are now putting some of these approaches into practice.

For government, the forthcoming book Essentially Digital Governance provides a design and normative framework for government in the digital era. We have had much interest from both academics and policy-makers in this work, stimulated by Helen Margetts' presentations to (for example) civil servants in the UK, US, Ireland, the Netherlands, Japan, Spain and the World Economic Forum (in Davos and Dubai) and other outputs described on Researchfish. All three anonymous reviewers of the original proposal to Oxford University Press cited how valuable this book will be to policy-making and practitioner communities, as well as providing a fresh new approach to academic thinking on digital government.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>51537CAA-C96B-40AE-92AB-BAB3105783C4</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5497eb7e7f18e0.79920143</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://blogs.oii.ox.ac.uk/policy/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Established a Policy Innovation Unit in the Alan Turing Institute for Data Science, to work out innovative new ways that data science can be used to improve government and policy-making</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>243FB2A9-26A1-4915-82B1-AD047BDF92BE</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c81e0f4dde26.86538884</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Membership of a guideline committee</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.turing.ac.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Expert Witness to House of Commons Public Administration Select Committee on Statistics and Open Data</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6E130FC7-DACD-4D19-B7FE-87EC211F0098</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5464835f8698a9.77894669</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/public-administration-select-committee/news/statistics-and-open-data1/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Redesigning the Government Petitions Platform</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CA868A76-DC74-4651-A6F1-A4F676BA931F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545a6441dca904.20347138</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-committees/procedure/2014-15/petition-signing-in-the-UK.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>National Audit Office Expert Group</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>08CB6CF2-FE3E-4A15-83C3-7CAA38E5AE82</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546481c1cc3207.27371716</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Membership of a guidance committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Universal Credit Evaluation Group and DWP use of research for understanding citizens</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>81C2A3C6-839B-4C4A-8E01-15A7469A0A49</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54648176eb7db0.49687701</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Keynote Speech at Command and Control in the Information Age Symposium, MOD, Tidworth</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2F647F8B-F716-4C46-8277-89455A38EAED</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>560421c42c51d4.45756374</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://static1.squarespace.com/static/53bad224e4b013a11d687e40/t/54be9fbce4b0ab9f360ccf41/1421778876068/C2+ST+Challenges+-+Symposium+24+March+2015++-+email+registration.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Expert Witness to House of Commons Procedure Committee on Government Petitions</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B16D1A1B-3258-45B7-9025-702E45045999</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5464848b6ced47.95233650</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/procedure-committee/news/second-oral-evidence-e-petitions/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Raised Awareness of the Digital Landscape</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D5F34F22-AF01-4DA2-A8FE-61746E6117EC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>On 11th June 2014 I gave a three hour digital masterclass to 40 reasonably senior civil servants (grade 7 and above) on 'The Digital Landscape'.

The idea was to educate civil servants whose primary role was not necessarily related to the digital function of the importance of digital technologies for public service design and delivery, and in particular the potential importance of 'big data' and data science approaches for government (one of the key themes of the Award). The Masterclass generated an extremely rich discussion and the feedback was very good indeed, with 100 per cent of respondents to the evaluation forms (most of the Masterclass) saying that the learning experience was engaging and that they felt able to participate - and 93.4 per cent saying 'I will be more effective at work as a result of this event'.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>5463592b5eea55.51980918</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Number of signatures to 19,621 petitions over time (hourly resolution) along with petition metadata (title, category, time of creation), directly crawled from the website.</gtr:description><gtr:id>71AB1603-0386-420C-AD11-3FF7F7C685B2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The data has been analysed extensively and the results have been communicated to the House of Commons and the Government Digital Services.
