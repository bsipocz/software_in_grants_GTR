First discovered in Drosophila, where they are required for silencing of homeotic gene expression, polycomb proteins have since been found to play a key role in mammalian development and the maintenance of stem cell identity. Their disregulation is associated with aberrant gene experssion in a range of malignancies. The general aim of the project is to study the function of Polycomb group proteins at a well defined mammalian locus, the alpha globin gene cluster, in order to establish general principles of Polycomb function in mammals. In embryonic stem cells several hundred genes are bound by Polycomb. During development, removal of Polycomb is essential for activation of lineage-specific genes. The mechanisms governing this removal in mammals remain obscure. The specific goal of the project is to study this process at the alpha globin gene locus. This locus has been the subject of intense investigation by the host laboratory and is consequently amongst the best characterised mammalian gene clusters. The host laboratory has shown that Polycomb proteins bind to regions of the alpha globin cluster silencing expression in embryonic stem and non-erythroid cells but in differentiated erythroid cells binding is absent. The first aim of the project is to establish the timing of Polycomb removal during erythroid differentiation. We will isolate by FACS populations enriched in haematopoietic stem cells and various progenitor populations from primary bone marrow samples. The presence of Polycomb at the alpha globin locus will be determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and real time PCR. Current ChIP protocols require a minimum of 106 cells, however only 103 to 105 cells of each progenitor population can be obtained from a single bone marrow sample. Therefore we will employ a novel ChIP method in which Drosophila cells are added as a ?Carrier?. This technique can reliably analyse as few as 100-1000 cells. The second aim of the project is to determine the sequences required for Polycomb recruitment and for removal during differentiation. We will employ mononucleosomal ChIP and a tiled array to determine Polycomb binding at single nucleosome resolution across the alpha globin locus. We will also characterise Polycomb binding in erythroid cell lines (interspecies hybrids) containing deletions of previously identified cis-regulatory regions and of the alpha globin promotors. We hope to discover general principles governing removal of Polycomb during mammalian development.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>110609</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">G1000865</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>939798CA-B6AE-4C12-9DCC-A0F88F84E6F3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Blood</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>CF950C9A-DB16-4E23-8AEB-94548777BCA1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>1.1  Normal biological development and functioning</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
