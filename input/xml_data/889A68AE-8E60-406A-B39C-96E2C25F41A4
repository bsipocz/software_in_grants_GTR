What is far less well understood is how the tools, techniques and procedures work within particular communities of practice, particularly in the commercial sector and in the public administration. Where complex digital data, such as 3D models and CAD/CAM are involved, potentially significant technical issues and attendant risks are increased.

In effect, collections of these digital records are spread over repositories with relevant differences in scale, policies and functions. The vast majority of these assets is represented by documentation held by Architecture practices and neither intended for ingestion in national repositories nor for long term retention in commercial archives. Cultural heritage stakeholders, such as public institutions and academic investigators, and building control authorities are potentially at risk by disappearance of these digital products. Indeed, these assets bear multiple information vital for the built heritage management and study, such as for example the detailed record of the interventions on the historical buildings and their analytical documentation. 

The heterogeneity and complexity of these digital objects, as well as the prevailing role of institutional repositories in establishing preservation and curation policies for the digital assets, discourage architectural practices from both implementing specific curatorial procedures and maximising the value for all parties in the long time management and retention of their digital assets. 

For these reasons, this project is aimed at developing specific policies, procedures and requirements for insuring a sustainable curation in the long term of these assets in the context of practices and other informal repositories. 

In order to achieve this goal, given an estimated time for this project of nine months, the investigator will: a) undertake an audit of both the assets produced and held by select Scottish Architecture practices, municipal building control authorities and building contractors and the infrastructure and procedures implemented for their preservation and reuse; b) examine the cultural and economical suitability of preservation best practices for commercial repositories; c) produce specific guidelines, recommendations and a workflow description for this curatorial framework.

This investigation will be conducted at the Humanities Advanced Technology and Information Institute of the University of Glasgow (HATII) which is one of the world's leading centres for computing and information studies in the arts and humanities. The involvement of HATII in the international project 3D-COFORM (Tools and Expertise for 3D Collection Formation) will benefit the Researcher with a wide network of international expertise on 3D documentation and representation of Built Heritage.

This research will assess six partners' repositories, two for each of the categories analysed by this study. Among the Architecture practices that have already agreed to participate in this study are the prestigious firms Keppies and Page &amp;amp; Park. These will offer a representative selection of the records held in their digital archives to be audited and disclose their production and retention procedures and infrastructures to the investigator scrutiny.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The policies, requirements and procedures that will be delivered by this study will offer Architecture practices and assimilable stakeholders, such as the Museums and small and medium archives retaining Built Environment related records, the state of the art knowledge to manage and exploit their digital data whilst reducing the risks of data loss. 

Since many European Building Regulation authorities have already established, as part of a Building Warrant application, the compulsory deposit of CAD files, it is likely that also local authorities will adopt in the near future this policy. In this case, local Building Regulation authorities could adopt the recommendations produced by this study to implement consistent and affordable curatorial procedures in their digital repositories.

An accurate digital documentation of Built Heritage is still an expensive activity although many initiatives have intended to enhance its affordability, nevertheless, its validity is rapidly consummated by the obsolescence of the production technology so causing an increase in costs. But, this research will contribute to enhancing the efficacy of investments in digital documentation of Built Heritage since, by prolonging their reliable usability, it will assure the viability of their use and reuse in order to derive new products as well as the management of the pertinent intellectual rights. For example, despite the obsolescence of technology and formats, some information resulting from past research could be still useful to some stakeholders for investigation, dissemination and governance purposes or the entertainment industry, but without an adequate curation of digital assets this would not be possible.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>61354</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Within the framework of the collaboration with the Master of Research of the University of Glasgow, I have authored together with the Master student, Gaetano Chianese, a digitally fabricated pavilion.

DEDICATE partners and collaborators included both national and international Institutions, HEIs and commercial practices. 



DEDICATE initially addressed the Digital Assets' creation and management across Scottish Architecture practices, municipal building control authorities and building contractors. One of the main, and unexpected, findings of was that the set of procedures implemented by this group of stakeholders proved to be particularly conservative: advanced Digital Design processes were completely absent and the workflows still heavily reliant on print documentation. In particular, the lack of implemented Digital Manufacturing procedures within the partners' workflows prevented the documentation and analysis of the rapidly growing phenomenon of the Design Data integration according to a product lifecycle model, that is embracing conceptualisation, collaboration, production and management. 



Because of both the extended interest in this project and the need to include in its analysis these recent developments in the Digital Design sector, DEDICATE research activities were extended to include experiments, studies and analysis that complemented the original investigation . This included novel approaches to Digital Design, Building Information Modelling, Generative Design and Digital Manufacturing that went beyond the original group of partners..



As a result DEDICATE has gathered unprecedentedly exhaustive information on both the demographic distribution of Digital Assets produced within the Construction sector, both in current professional practices and emerging speculative initiatives, and the workflows and procedures implemented by their stakeholders. 



Through the DEDICATE investigation it was possible to individuate, beside the renowned difficulties and issues of managing Built Environment related Digital Data, a new set of both curatorial issues and management problems arising from the implementation of Collaborative and Concurrent Design within the framework of advanced Digital Design procedures.



These challenges in the management of these Digital Assets were demonstrated to be difficult to resolve without the active participation of stakeholders in the discussion and implementation of guidelines and workflows specific to their contexts. The DEDICATE investigation also focused on the consequent need to educate and train both Architecture students and Architects on the Management and Curation of their Digital Data. The collaboration with two important HEI institutions allowed us to design the first Digital Curation module for Computer Aided Architectural Drawing (CAAD) education.



Through its initiatives a network of national and international experts and stakeholders was gathered that had, during the DEDICATE symposium, an opportunity to meet and discuss the state of the art and the priorities for future investigation in the field of the Information Management for Architectural Data.



From this investigation, the network debate and the contacts with the Construction sector emerged the need to invest further research into the standards, policies and procedures to facilitate the long term management of Data integrating Generative Design and Building Information Modelling through scalable Information Management Systems.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Explicitly addressing the Construction sector, the results of this investigation could benefit the development of this industry as it is envisaged by both the Government and international policies. For example, in Netherlands, since November 2011, the Rgd BIM Norm obliges design contractors involved in public building projects to produce and deliver their products in Building Information Modelling formats following the policies of the Rgd BIM standard. In the same year, the United Kingdom Cabinet Office announced in the Government's new Construction Strategy that will require on all public works BIM (Building Information Modelling) documentation by 2016.



The introduction of Digital Technologies in this sector it is sought to resolve energetic efficiency of the products, to improve the efficacy of the Design process by enhancing the accessibility and interoperability of the data, to allow for the early detection of clashes within collaborative procedures, to facilitate the Building process management and the prefabrication of elements and to foster the management of the Built Products. The results of this project could especially foster the optimisation of the information accessibility in this sector, its durability, authority and long term reliability by both promoting curatorial competences among its stakeholders and informing the development of specific Information Management tools.



IT specialists could benefit from the DEDICATE results to orient the development of both technologies and specific solutions for this sector. For example, the actual management functions offered within CAD packages are neither adequate to preserve the accessibility of Digital Assets along the product lifecycle and across domains, nor to document the professional liability of Designers. The DEDICATE results could be used to design solutions for these shortcomings. Further, the AEC sector (Architecture, Engineering and Construction) is lacking specific Information Managements tools tailored on its technical and operative challenges - this investigation has both highlighted the features such systems should implement and stressed through its teaching initiative the level of customisation users from this sector should expect from these products.



The DEDICATE research reviewed also the development of Standards for the Construction sector and made patent that, despite the great recent advancements, many shortcomings are still arising from the adoption of current Standards. This investigation demonstrated also the scarce adoption of relevant Archival Standards in this sector. Regulators, Representative Bodies and Institutions could use the DEDICATE results to both promote the diffusion of Standards across stakeholders of the Digital Assets of this industry and enhance the curatorial aspects of already available Standards. In this way, the DEDICATE results would foster also the sustainability of the development policies developed for the AEC sector.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>3C000DCE-DE5E-49C6-9449-03D7FE12A7F7</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-5564450300.824316775f1ca4</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Construction,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://architecturedigitalcuration.blogspot.co.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>16AC1BA8-C434-4624-AC92-7D1E25183847</gtr:id><gtr:title>Digital Curation in Architecture Curricula and Vocational Training for Architects - The DEDICATE Framework in Architecture CAD Courses Design</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/a21e9f0b6af6809c0364d7dae2b05b11"><gtr:id>a21e9f0b6af6809c0364d7dae2b05b11</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ruggero L (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>r_614943871964233e2c</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/J008265/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>9DD86EE2-EE6B-432E-AEE0-0C8669A1CBB0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Library &amp; information studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>C96AF50D-AD7C-4C61-A30E-B8619DB33BAA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Archives</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>0A982A4A-12CF-4734-AFCA-A5DC61F667F3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Information &amp; Knowledge Mgmt</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4CB45E5D-2967-4DA2-A648-379E829E1892</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Records Management</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
