However, it is connected with a problem that excites the imagination more generally and has been the subject of many films and books: How can I know that those around me are not automata or creatures lacking what we call a mind? Philosophers have debated this question in one form or another since at least the time of Descartes. Descartes considers in his Meditations whether, when he looks out of his window and sees men crossing in the street, the hats and coats might conceal automated machines. \n\n'Acting With vs. Knowing Others'\n\nThe question, then, is how I can know that those around me are not all automata - individuals without a mind? Since the time of Descartes, epistemologists have been concerned to give an account of our knowledge of the world and other minds which can satisfy the radical skeptic who asks this question about automata. More recently, philosophers such as Alvin Goldman, Fred Dretske and Robert Nozick propose to give an account of knowledge that remains neutral or silent on the skeptical question. This work has come to be known as' knowledge externalism', and the Cartesian account of knowledge that this opposes has come to be known as 'knowledge internalism'. I argue that the challenge that knowledge externalists make to internalism is not as radical as that offered by another philosopher, Ludwig Wittgenstein. In his collected remarks, published under the title On Certainty, Wittgenstein also offers a challenge to Descartes and the internalist (via a challenge to the work off G.E. Moore). I claim that Wittgenstein's challenge here is deeper and more radical because it challenges the very idea that we know that others are minded as we are. In the place of knowledge Wittgenstein writes of acting in the world with others. Exploring the relationship between acting and knowing forms an important part of my research here. \n\n\n\n'Perception of Other Minds'\n\nIn his recent book, The Possibility of Knowledge, Quassim Cassam defends a perceptual account of our knowledge of other minds. Cassam here develops an idea first put forward by John McDowell some years ago. The idea is a powerful one, but neither McDowell nor any other philosopher - until Cassam - has developed it. For this reason alone, Cassam's discussion is an important one. Cassam claims to develop a model of perceptual knowledge here first suggested by Fred Dretske. Dretske, however, is less ambitious than Cassam. Dretske believes that I see, for example, that another is in pain but he does not believe that I can see that the other is not an automaton. The defense of Dretske's position is complex and difficult. Cassam thinks he can avoid this counterintuitive conclusion. Cassam holds that I can have perceptual knowledge, for example, that the other is in pain as well as perceptual knowledge that the other is not an automaton. I discuss this important difference between these two philosophers and suggest an account of why they come to such different conclusions about the scope of the perceptual model. I then argue that Cassam is not yet in a position to defend his more radical conclusion. Cassam defends his position by appealing to our basic commitments. I shall suggest that we need to explore this idea yet further before it can do the work Cassam wants from it. \n\n\n\n\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-05-09</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-01-12</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>26725</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>It has been added to a handbook in philosophy and psychiatry.
