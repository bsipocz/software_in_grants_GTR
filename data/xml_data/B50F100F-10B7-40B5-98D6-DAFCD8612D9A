The goal pursued by SysMO is to record and describe the dynamic molecular processes occurring in microorganisms in a comprehensive way and to present these processes in the form of computerized mathematical models. The aim is to pool research capacities and know-how from eleven projects. To facilitate this process, the Data Management Group (DMG) has been created to support data access and integration. Each of the individual projects in SysMO are working towards different research outcomes and represent a cross-section of microorganisms, including bacteria, archaea and yeast. The environmental conditions for each organism also vary widely with organisms growing in culture, soil, water and animal hosts. As a consequence of this diversity, there is no one model for experimentation or for the types of data collected and the types of models produced. In order to pool the research outcomes for SysMO, our job is to support and manage this diversity and promote a shared understanding across the community by using the same technologies. The underlying premises are (i) the systematic management of data, models and processes; (ii) the gathering of minimal information to support reproducible science, and (iii) shared best practice. The main objectives of a data management solution for SysMO are thus to: facilitate the web-based exchange of data between research groups within- and inter- consortia, and to provide an integrated platform for the dissemination of the results of the SysMO projects to the scientific community. The aim of this proposal is to present a progressive and scalable solution to the data management needs of the SysMO initiative, that: facilitates and maximises the potential for data exchange between SysMO research groups, maximises the 'shelf life' and utility of data generated by SysMO, provides an integrated platform for the dissemination of the results of the SysMO projects to the scientific community, and facilitates standardization of practices in Systems Biology for the interfacing of modelling and experimentation. We will adopt a progressive solution to the data exchange, comparison and dissemination needs of the SysMO initiative combining elements to support data storage and annotation, model storage and annotation, and the definition of (common) processes using workflows combining access to SysMO and external resources and for building models. We will provide unified access through a portal - the SysMO-HUB. We will create a catalogue of data assets - SysMO-SEEK; of models using JWS Online; and of workflows using myExperiment, and integrated search across all these through the HUB. We will help the partners develop their data management systemsand adopt community solution;, annotate models and adopt community standards and develop and share workflows using a de facto community system, Taverna. Metadata for discovery and exchange will be identified and developed on an on-demand basis sufficient without being overbearing. We will create an environment where the SysMO groups will be able to exchange their results as and when they want, disseminate their results outside the consortium and effectively use the resources of the wider Systems Biology community.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>We will adopt a progressive solution, with regular staged delivery of capability, to the data exchange, comparison and dissemination needs of the SysMO initiative. The solution combines elements to support data storage and annotation, model storage and annotation, and the definition of (common) processes using workflows. There will be an emphasis on training, dissemination of best practice and 'help yourself' throughout the consortium in order to ensure sustainability and scalability. We will provide unified access through a secure portal - the SysMO-HUB - implemented using the Liferay Portal Framework, with fully customised access control. We will create a new, annotated, catalogue of data assets - SysMO-SEEK; of models using the JWS Online repository and simulator; and of workflows using the myExperiment workflow repository and social network system. Integrated search across all three repositories will be possible from the portal. Plugins through portlets will enable query and updates to datasets, model simulation and workflow execution. We will help the partners to: develop their data management systems and adopt where relevant community solutions such as SABIO-RK; accurately annotate models and adopt community standards such as SBML and MIRIAM; and develop and share workflows for the automated build of SBML models and the integration of resources within and without SysMO, using a de facto bio-community system, Taverna. Metadata for discovery and exchange of data, models and workflows will be identified and developed on an on-demand basis sufficient without being overbearing. We will create an environment where the SysMO groups will be able to exchange their results as and when they want to whom they want, disseminate their results outside the consortium and effectively reuse the resources of the wider Systems Biology community.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>636905</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies</gtr:description><gtr:id>1FA068F9-9788-4B0F-BE4A-C97A42FDF0A9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>See the outputs and outcomes arising from the SysMO-DB1 and SysMO-DB2 BBSRC awards.

The platform had been adopted by 10+ independent projects (e.g. Unicellsys, JenAge, RosAge, SBCancer, Sybacol projects) and local group instances have been established at the VU Amsterdam for Yeast Glycolysis, Systems Science for Health in Birmingham and Magdeburg Centre for Systems Biology. Commercially, SEEK is a component of Eagle Genomics Ltd's eaglecore platform.

Since the establishment of the FAIRDOM project (partially funded by the DMMCore BBSRC award) 58 projects now use the FAIRDOMHub (a public Commons which subsumes the SysMO and ERASysAPP SEEKs) and 30 projects use the software platform in their own instances. 

The SysMO-DB project has also directly lead to the DMMCore award that created the FAIRDOM project, a consortium of 4 EU funding councils to: Establish a sustainable European Infrastructure to extend the network services to the wider European systems biology community; Develop the necessary toolset and set up a data and model management platform for systems biology project, building on SEEK and openBIS (SystemsX); and document and disseminate the outcomes and activities to funding agencies, projects and centres with the goal of establishing a sustainable business model for this infrastructure. See the DDMCore entry. 
We have since established the FAIRDOM Association e.V. to promote and sustain the products and services first developed in SysMO-DB.

The JWS Online Sys Bio model database and simulation system continues to offer data and simulation facilities.

The PALs knowledge network and the workshop/tutorial programme have been adopted by other projects

Our work on COMBINE (MIRIAM, SED-ML) and ISA standards is adopted by the wider community for data and model management.

In partnership with HITS, Heidelberg, the project:
- developed the SEEK platform for the lightweight management of data, models and SOPs in Systems Biology (http://www.seek4science.org). This has functionalities for project management (yellow pages), organising outcomes using the ISA framework, catalogues ad repositories for digital assets arising from Sys Bio research, seamless integration with Sys Bio simulators and gateways to third party data archives. It is standards driven.

- established the SysMO-SEEK resource for the projects to register, interlink, retain and share their results (http://https://seek.sysmo-db.org/)
This has now been subsumed into the FAIRDOMHub Commons (http://www.fair-dom.org). 50% of the projects still actively use the platform many years after the programme ended.

- developed a methodology for lightweight data gathering using Just Enough Results Model (JERM)

- developed tools (RightField, http://www.rightfield.org.uk) for making JERM templates and spreadsheet tools to help biologists with data curation

- developed the JWS Online Sys Bio model database and simulation system.

- ran summer schools, workshops, tutorials and training programmes

- founded and operated a PALs knowledge network of young researchers in the SysMO projects who became skilled data managers, champions and scouts for the platform.

- assisted projects to curate their data and models, with numerous site visits

- participated in Sys Bio Standards activities, notably the COMBINE and ISA standards.

- worked with funding councils to set data sharing policy and data management strategy.

The SEEK was adopted by all but 1 of the SysMO projects and has gone on to be widely adopted in other programmes, notably the Virtual Liver Network, ERANet ERASysBio+ projects, and the ERANet ERASysAPP projects. 

The platform was adopted by 10+ independent projects (e.g. Unicellsys, JenAge, RosAge, SBCancer, Sybacol) and local group instances have been established at the VU Amsterdam for Yeast Glycolysis, Systems Science for Health in Birmingham and Magdeburg Centre for Systems Biology. Commercially, SEEK was a component of Eagle Genomics Ltd's ElasticAP platform. 
Since the SysMO Programme the platform has been further adopted (see the DMMCore Entry). currently 58 projects use the FAIRDOMHub; 30 projects/groups use their own instances of the platform.

Two of the BBSRC SynBio Centres use the SEEK as their data/model/SOP Platform.

The SysMO-SEEK resource continues to be used by over half the SysMO projects, even after the funds, the programmes and the projects ended. Many groups are including the platform in their new grant proposals. 

The JWS Online Sys Bio model database and simulation system continues to offer data and simulation facilities.

The PALs knowledge network and the workshop/tutorial programme have been adopted by other projects, notably FAIRDOM and the VLN.

The Platform is now developed under the FAIRDOM Initiative (funded by the DMMCore project partners, including the BBSRC) http://www.fair-dom.org.

The software platform has been independently adopted by 30+ groups in Europe, Russia, South Africa, USA, and the UK. EU Projects that adopt the platform include: EmPowerPutida and Mycosynvac; national projects include the German Systems Medicine for Liver project and the de.NBI German Bioinformatics Network, and the Norway's Digital Life programme. The platform has been adopted by the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory a large national scientific user facility at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) in Washington State, USA. Combined with the openBIS system, it is the platform for two UK Synthetic Biology Centre's data management (SynBioChem and SynthSys). 

58 projects are currently registered on FAIRDOMHub.org Commons, a centralised public community instance of the SEEK4Science Platform. 
Work on the SysMO-DB project and the SEEK directly lead to participation in the ESFRI Research Infrastructure ISBE Light - Infrastructure for Systems Biology Europe, and we have lead the Data and model management work package setting out Europe's plans for this area. 

The SEEK4Science software and associated software, FAIRDOMHub Commons and its support services form a core pillar of the ISBE Light Interim phase. 

Commercially, SEEK was the prototype component of Eagle Genomics Ltd's eaglecore platform and is currently being reviewed by 3 commercial organisations.
