They are important both because they can attack pathogens and cancer cells themselves and also because they control the immune response of other cell types. This project will investigate how three proteins called Hedgehog proteins help to control T cell function. Hedgehog proteins are molecules that are secreted to send signals from one cell to other neighbouring cells. They are essential during development in the foetus as they control the shape of our bodies and the formation of many different types of tissue. After birth Hedgehog proteins are still very important because they regulate many self-renewing tissues in our bodies, such as gut and skin and lung. Hedgehog proteins are also involved in cancer and are secreted by some tumours and inhibiting them is a treatment for some types of cancer. This project will investigate what signals Hedgehog proteins give to T cells and how Hedgehog proteins influence the immune response. We will also test what effect secretion of Hedgehog proteins by tumours has on the way T cells respond to the tumour.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>This project will investigate the roles of the Hedgehog (Hh) signalling pathway in peripheral T cell differentiation and function, and the molecular mechanisms that underlie these functions. We aim to understand how Hh proteins produced by peripheral tissues influence T cell fate. We will investigate Hh function in peripheral T cells in mouse Hh pathway mutants and conditional knockouts, TCR-transgenics, and Hh- and TCR-reporter mice, using in vitro assays of T cell activation and function, and in vivo models, analysing by flow cytometry, microscopy, protein chemistry, transriptomics, and ChIP.
We will use TCR-reporter transgenics and Hh-reporter transgenics to test the hypothesis that Hh pathway activation reduces TCR signal transduction at the single cell level, and to investigate cross-talk between Hh and TCR signal transduction. We will define the different functions of the three Hedgehog proteins in CD4 and CD8 T cell differentiation and test the hypothesis that Hedgehog pathway activation influences Th17 induction. We will test the impact of manipulation of Hh signalling to T cells on tumour rejection. We will use RNAseq and ChIPseq to identify Hh target genes in CD4 and CD8 cells and we will investigate the function of selected target genes in T cell differentiation and effector function.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our research into the immune system will impact on human health and the treatment and prevention of human diseases, and we will therefore communicate and engage with the Health services and the Pharmaceutical/Biotechnological industry. In addition, the project will train members of the workforce, and we will be actively involved in Public Engagement in Science.

1) Development of strategies to enhance immunotherapy to cancer
Hedgehog inhibitors are used to treat several cancers and the recent emergence of T cell check-point inhibitors in immunotherapy to cancer have revealed the importance of the T cell response in beating cancer. It is therefore essential and timely to understand the influence of Hh-inhibition on the T cell response to tumours. This has relevance to the NHS and Healthcare Sector, and to the Pharmaceutical industry.

2) Development of strategies to treat T-cell leukaemia
Understanding the way in which Hedgehog signalling regulates T cell fate should shed light on T acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL), which arises from malignant transformation of T cell progenitors. Dysregulated Hedgehog signalling has recently been shown to be involved in T-ALL, and T-ALL is difficult to treat, and new strategies are needed. This is of direct relevance to industry for drug discovery (Pharma), and to the NHS, and private healthcare sector.

3) Development of strategies to treat allergic disease, autoimmunity and immunodeficiencies
Understanding the way in which Hedgehog signalling regulates T cell fate should shed light on diseases involving T cells and Hedgehog pathway components, such as allergic disease, autoimmunity and immunodeficiency. This is of relevance to industry for drug discovery (Pharma), and to the NHS, and private healthcare sector.

4) Biotechechnology and Pharmaceutical industry
The project will produce Intellectual Property and may develop reagents, which may be commercially exploited to benefit the UK economy, by Pharmaceutical and Biotech industries.

5) Training for biomedical scientists
The project will train the postdoctoral scientist in wet-lab biomedical science (molecular biology, immunology, cell biology). This will potentially benefit academic and industrial biomedical science in the UK.

6) Personalised health care for human well-being
The project provides a strong framework to train the postdoctoral scientist in computation skills and bioinformatics (through analysis of next generation sequencing data- RNAseq and transcriptomics). The current revolution in personalised biological data has enormous implications for health care and well-being, and has resulted in an increasing demand for skilled labour in the field of computer science/computational biology and the handling of massive datasets. This unmet need currently limits UK competitiveness in public and private sectors. Our project will train the postdoctoral scientist in these areas, with relevance to the public and private sectors for healthcare, the insurance industry, and Pharma/Biotech industry. 

7) Public understanding of science.
Through public outreach events and events for school students, the project will promote public understanding of biomedical science and inspire school students to study biomedical science.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-01-04</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-01-05</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>481824</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2CD30E6C-0D87-4CFF-AA54-E0235E95173A</gtr:id><gtr:title>In the fetal thymus, Gli3 in thymic epithelial cells promotes thymocyte positive selection and differentiation by repression of Shh.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Development (Cambridge, England)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/bf9f0bd65d21d307ebef97e9ce8deb7c"><gtr:id>bf9f0bd65d21d307ebef97e9ce8deb7c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Solanki A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2018-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0950-1991</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a678eea565662.15930313</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>164A87CA-C31D-4CFE-979C-989CADFBC210</gtr:id><gtr:title>The transcription factor Gli3 promotes B cell development in fetal liver through repression of Shh.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Journal of experimental medicine</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/bf9f0bd65d21d307ebef97e9ce8deb7c"><gtr:id>bf9f0bd65d21d307ebef97e9ce8deb7c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Solanki A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0022-1007</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fcc256b59b3.79797326</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/P000843/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>C6D70A71-8796-47BC-AFE0-CC2286E66A06</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Inflammatory and Immune System</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>CF950C9A-DB16-4E23-8AEB-94548777BCA1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>1.1  Normal biological development and functioning</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
