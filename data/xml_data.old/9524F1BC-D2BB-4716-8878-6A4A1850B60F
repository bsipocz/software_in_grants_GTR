It affects the skin, joints and in some cases is associated with inflammatory diseases such and Crohn's disease and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. The disfiguring nature of the disease, often occurring on the face and scalp leads to multiple debilitating sociopsychological consequences including depression and suicide. In addition, 20% of people suffering from psoriasis progress to have psoriatic arthritis. This element of psoriatic disease is painful and debilitating and without early appropriate therapy causes permanent joint destruction with similar clinical manifestations to those of rheumatoid arthritis.
Although generalised treatments can be effective in some people, misdiagnosis of different subtypes of skin disease, side effects and the prohibitively expensive nature of more effective drugs often prevent appropriate and early treatment, leading to permanent tissue destruction. We are therefore in urgent need of new ways to diagnose subtypes of psoriasis to determine which patients are likely to develop psoriatic arthritis and require a better understanding of the molecules and genes involved in the disease for the targeting of new drugs. Our findings and those of others show that a particular group of regulatory proteins (IL-1 related family of cytokines) may be crucial in determining the disease course of psoriasis as well as acting as very selective diagnostic markers. Through this grant we intend to test and validate our newly developed tools against these molecules as diagnostic and prognostic reagents in psoriasis and arthritis subtypes. Using molecular techniques and skin models generated from the cells of healthy and diseased individuals our proposal will investigate the role of IL-1 related cytokine activation in the initiation and maintenance psoriatic inflammation. This research should lead to discovery of novel targets for future anti-psoriasis drugs and provide diagnostic and prognostic tools to allow for the appropriate and early treatment of skin psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Psoriasis is one of the most common immune-mediated inflammatory diseases affecting up to 4.8% of Europeans. It affects the skin, joints and in some cases is associated with significant co-morbidities including Crohn's disease and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. The disfiguring nature of skin psoriasis, often leads to multiple detrimental sociopsychological and economic consequences. Importantly, 20% of people suffering from skin psoriasis are affected by psoriatic arthritis. This element of psoriatic disease is debilitating and without early appropriate therapy causes permanent joint destruction similar that observed in rheumatoid arthritis. The complex genetic and environmental etiology of psoriasis leads to heterogeneity in disease subtype, progression and responsiveness to drugs. We therefore require further molecular insight into the initiation and progression of the disease in order to provide new drug targets, and need new diagnostic/prognostic tools to allow the subtyping necessary for early and effective therapeutic intervention. From published and unpublished results showing the dramatic and selective gene regulation, and the functional requirement for post-translational processing, we hypothesise that the regulation and proteolytic activation of IL-1 related cytokines is critical in initiating and modulating psoriatic inflammatory. Our objectives for this proposal are:

Using patient biopsies, already generated recombinant proteins and inhibitor screening we will: 1 &amp;quot;Isolate mature IL-1 related cytokines generated in psoriasis and determine the proteases responsible&amp;quot;
Using newly generated unique monoclonal antibodies suitable for assaying serum and synovial fluid we will: 2 &amp;quot;Compare IL-1 related protein expression in psoriasis subtypes and other immune-mediated inflammatory diseases&amp;quot;
Using a skin equivalence model from healthy/patient-derived cells we will: 3 &amp;quot;Validate the role of IL-1 related cytokines in a 3D skin equivalence model</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Impact summary

Academics
As described in the Academic Beneficiaries section our findings and reagents should prove usefully in the advancement of knowledge in a number of research areas including: skin inflammation, anti-fungal immunity, arthritis, skin development and homeostasis, scarring/fibrosis and wound healing. Further work into these in these areas will have obvious future economic benefits and impacts on patient wellbeing.

Patients and NHS
Possibly the most significant impart from this research will be on psoriasis patient wellbeing. Due to the conspicuous nature of skin psoriasis, symptoms can often lead to depression, anxiety, withdrawal from society and sometimes suicide. In the long term, improvement of diagnosis/treatment generated from this research will obviously greatly benefit patients psychological as well as have indirect benefits to the wider economy through reducing time off work and treatment in primary and secondary care etc. The development of tools and knowledge through this proposal may allow the early diagnosis and effective treatment patients who will progress to psoriatic arthritis. Again this will help reducing patient suffering by altering the disease course and help reduce the economic burden which according to 2008 studies cost the US $11.25 billion per annum in both direct and indirect costs.

Industry
In addition to academic colleagues, we envisage that the commercial sector will wish to utilise our findings and screening methods to develop small molecule protease inhibitors for the potential therapeutic use against psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Ultimately, this will enhance the economic competitiveness of the UK, improve the skills base of UK-based scientists and ultimately may provide part of an effective anti-inflammatory chemotherapeutic strategy. To facilitate this transition from the basic science proposed in this application to translational research, the University of Leeds has several mechanisms already in place, including seed funding, dedicated personnel with industrial and knowledge transfer expertise, and previously established commercial/academic partnerships. 

Public
The final group of beneficiaries is the public. At the UoL and Faculty of Biological science we have strong links with local schools and museums, particularly the Thackray Museum (The Museum of Modern Medicine, Leeds). We regularly work with the museum on biologically and medically relevant science being undertaken at UoL. In addition, members of FBS (including Dr Stacey) routinely visit local secondary schools and participate in the Leeds Annual Festival of Science to explain the purpose of their research. In this way the public will be made aware of the efforts of academic institutions to safe guard the nation's health.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>426474</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>9776F484-D0F0-4941-A2FE-7E5470DD1531</gtr:id><gtr:title>Cathepsin S is the major activator of the psoriasis-associated proinflammatory cytokine IL-36?.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5ec4a2696b4f6c6fdc4555181c924a5d"><gtr:id>5ec4a2696b4f6c6fdc4555181c924a5d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ainscough JS</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0027-8424</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fd6b79925d6.83239869</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>838FB251-F868-46C0-8443-956C3FE590FA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Neutrophil Elastase-mediated proteolysis activates the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-36 Receptor antagonist.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Scientific reports</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/59652378d78f4e8ff6a33291907e40ef"><gtr:id>59652378d78f4e8ff6a33291907e40ef</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Macleod T</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2045-2322</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>585d7407bbb9f7.14697194</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>FF1370A0-FA5C-402B-9F9A-FEE16A014964</gtr:id><gtr:title>IL-36? has proinflammatory effects on human endothelial cells.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Experimental dermatology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/cd51594f2cf9ea392cd9168ece07261c"><gtr:id>cd51594f2cf9ea392cd9168ece07261c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bridgewood C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0906-6705</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58b569aaa42b64.26215669</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>AB293057-9CBD-433B-9236-AE3BA87A8AF0</gtr:id><gtr:title>IL-36?
