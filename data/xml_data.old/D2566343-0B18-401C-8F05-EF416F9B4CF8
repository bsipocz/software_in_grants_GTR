Fraud/Crime</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/M003094/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>As food supply chains have become increasingly global and complex, new and challenging risks have emerged. One of the risks gaining attention from industry, governments, regulatory bodies and consumer organisations is food fraud conducted for economic gain. The Food Standards Agency says that Food fraud is committed 'when food is deliberately placed on the market, for financial gain, with the intention of deceiving the consumer'. Although there are many kinds of food fraud the two main types are: (1) the sale of food which is unfit for consumption and (2) the deliberate misdescription of food. Both types may directly threaten human health. For example, a cancer causing toxin (called melamine) was added to milk and infant formula in China to increase its protein content. Additionally, swapping one fish species with another could expose consumers to different allergens which could make them sick. In many instances, food fraud can reduce consumer trust in the both the food industry and food safety, and negatively impact on sales, as was demonstrated in the UK horsemeat scandal.

There is a growing concern that in some ways food fraud may be more risky than traditional threats to the food supply as the adulterants used in these activities are often unconventional. Melamine for example was not considered a potential contaminant in the food supply before 2007 and hence was not included in routine quality checks. In addition, current food protection systems are not designed to look for the never-ending number of potential adulterants that may show up in the food supply. As criminal activity by design is intended to elude detection, new tools and new approaches to supply chain management are called for. 

This proposal suggests combining theories and methods from psychology, political economy, sociology, anthropology, criminology and law, with natural science disciplines.
In order to develop new approaches to detect possible criminal activity in food supply chains, this project will undertake 34-40 semi-structured interviews with major buyers, brokers, regulators, customers etc. relating to the three food chains which are most prone to food fraud (wheat; fish and red meat). This will help us to determine how fraud can happen and what measures could be put in place to prevent it from happening in the future. Furthermore, using a desk-based approach we will explore how other countries deal with issues of food safety and analyse legal law cases as they relate to fraud. Based on an assumption that fraudsters WILL exploit any intelligence gathering system we will examine current and potential models of data collection and intelligence sharing and test their vulnerabilities to future fraudulent attacks. This will help to develop a novel data collection sharing system that is more robust and secure.

By evaluating a number of risk ranking methodologies used for fraud, food contaminants and emerging food issues, we will develop a risk ranking framework, to classify and highlight food security risks for different food commodities in our chosen supply chains. This will help recognise and prioritise the incentives/pressures to commit fraud, opportunities to commit fraud, and attitudes/rationalisations to justify fraud. A cost-benefit ranking will also be conducted in the risk assessment procedures. 

Finally, based on the data gathered for this project and a previous food fraud report we will identify methods of presenting fraud detection/prevention strategies to the public. We will also utilise eight focus groups with consumers to investigate their perceptions, attitudes, behavioural intentions, trust parameters, and expectations in relation to food fraud. Based on the findings we will conduct a survey (with 1000 UK consumers aged 18+ from different socio-demographic groups) to experimentally test the efficacy and feasibility of different fraud prevention strategies for its impact on enhancing consumer trust and increasing sales.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Impact to Industry through change in organisational culture and practices
Through their close involvement in the project design and implementation, both organisations (M&amp;amp;S and Youngs) will gain a key insight into how they could change their practices based on the research findings. We expect to have direct impact on all other retailers (e.g. Tesco, Sainsburys, etc.) working in the same sector as the organisations in the study. Further practices and lessons learned will lead to recommendations for improving risk management strategies. The efficacy of strategies tested with consumers will offer a way forward for food industries to enhance trust and confidence in the food products with a long term impact on sales. The knowledge gained about the environment in which food fraud/crime transpires within the international food system will assist UK suppliers and retailers to implement best practice. 

The use of developed model systems in the UK for addressing the knowledge and technological challenges in combating fraud may in the long term increase competiveness through reducing the incidence of food recalls which, in turn, will improve consumer confidence in the UK food supply. 

Impact on government departments through contributing towards evidence based policy making and influencing public policies and legislation at local, regional, national and international revel
The interaction with industry and Which? on the Expert Committee will allow the development of feasible and workable recommendations for data gathering as well as flagging up potential problems that can subsequently be communicated to regulators so future legislation/regulation is 'fit for purpose'. This is one of the unique aspects of this proposed research.

These findings will also help regulatory organisations (FSA &amp;amp; DEFRA) to review existing regulations and practices. Impact of food fraud on policy relevant information will be distilled and distributed to decision makers to inform their work around the area of public trust and credibility. The knowledge gained about the environment in which food fraud/crime transpires within the international food system and its effect on the UK will inform policy-makers on best practice for ensuring that food fraud does not taint supply chains. 

The models developed will be an advantage for both assessing the risk of compromised food security or fraud and through its implementation could help to maintain UK consumer safety associated with imported foods and ingredients. Capitalising on the team's previous and current involvement in international networks and EU projects would enable the UK to have a major influence on EU level regulation in future.

Impact on public perceptions and behaviours through enhancing consumer trust and industry risk management
We expect to have a direct dialogue with the consumer through the use of traditional and social media such as national and international TV (BBC, ITV, Sky), radio broadcasts at national and local levels, print media including all national newspapers, trade and consumer journals, LinkedIn, Twitter (@QUBFoodProf) and YouTube.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>421014</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Manchester</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>QUB and UOM proposal to the Global Food Security Programme</gtr:description><gtr:id>3717CE07-EA36-4F76-B8DE-CFCB55494901</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The proposal did not receive funding.

Chris acted as 'scientific advisor' for the show and attended the event which was held on Saturday 14th May at 12pm and 2:30pm in Edgbaston Street, Birmingham. 

The purpose of this event was to raise public awareness of the issues and the widespread implications of food crime both locally and nationally - and to create a platform for discussion. Audiences were encouraged to follow the conversation both in the run up to and during the live shows with #StopFoodCrime. 

This fun, arts-based event enabled wider audiences to engage with food crime, where the role of science, i.e. the forensics of food fraud, play a big part in helping to ensure that our food supply chains are reliable and robust.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>57399f93b1ada4.23229284</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2016/05/05/hand-feeds-musical-food-crime/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>3000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>Unknown</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>&amp;pound;3000 GFS Policy Lab Award to develop a report for the GFS programme (Dr Michelle Spence; Continuous Professional Development)</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Global Food Security</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>333B8BE8-F661-4809-96D8-56209E9BCBAD</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56dee80a0c1673.89435035</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-03-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>163000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>ESRC standard grant (open call based thematically on the case study in Work package 4):'The Right to Certify?

Mapping the food chain helps to identify and assess vulnerabilities with a greater need for global information sharing and detection
2. Traceability and transparency were considered to be important for deterring food fraud. However the way traceability information is conveyed was debated with some wanting shorter supply chains with trusted known actors while others were accepting of longer complex supply chains which conveyed traceability information through alternative means such as QR codes
2. Traceability information can enhance consumer beliefs resulting in positive attitudes and trust towards the product and supplier
3. Approximately 50% of the participants in the UK survey were keen to buy products with traceability information. However increase in intention to buy didn't always mean they were willing to pay more for the product
4. Not all consumers are interested in traceability information. Some sub groups within the population who are interested in traceability information would be willing to pay moderately more for the product. These individuals have greater concerns about general food hazards, have greater trust in traceable products and trust in the ability of consumer organisations, scientists and government bodies to provide this information.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The consumer study results will feed into the design of the H2020 EU-China-Safe - Delivering an Effective, Resilient and Sustainable EU-China Food Safety Partnership project that will start in October 2017.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>59E0F3F4-0396-4185-AE29-EDC55016D1A3</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56e0533ab739b3.74120093</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Work package 1: Prof Chris Elliott asked to chair FIIN</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>03FAA3E7-160C-4516-8DE3-B7FA991F4293</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Prof Chris Elliott has been asked to chair FIIN which met in October 2015 for the first time.

Prof Chris Elliott has informed and commented on the guide and written the welcome quote. It brings together advice on general food fraud prevention measures and practical measures that can be taken as well as steps at different points in the supply chain including transport and cold storage as well as how insurance plays a role in protecting a business.

The guide was presented to IMTA members and other attendees at the 2015 IMTA risk forum on 24th November in London. The forum included sessions entitled 'Reflections on the 2014 IMTA Risk Forum', where an update on food fraud initiatives where given by IMTA, Andy Morling (head of the FSA's NFCU), and Prof Elliott. This meeting brought together IMTA members and the NFCU with the aim of strengthening meat supply chains and mitigating meat crime threats to consumers.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56df06f73d9323.82541742</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.imta-uk.org/images/stories/press_releases/IMTAFraudPressRelease.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Work package 1: Young's Seafood Limited (YSL); A leading company in food crime risk analysis</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>35C55139-F01C-4D3D-814D-291D6E94AC08</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Based on both conversations with Prof Chris Elliott and on the Elliott review, Young's Seafood Limited (YSL) have carried out a full analysis of the fraud risks in their supply chains and have developed the industry leading food crime risk analysis. An up-to-date database is now maintained by YSL which identifies the mitigated food crime risk level (in nine areas) for all commodity materials purchased. The level of mitigated risk is contingent on the appropriate and identified measures being in place at the time of purchase. This approach was presented by Mike Mitchell (from YSL) at the World Seafood Congress in Grimsby on 8th September, 2015.

This will ultimately protect YSL, making it harder to penetrate by fraudsters and criminals in order that the greatest levels of protection and assurance can be provided to the
