This period marks the beginnings of a significant cultural exchange between the two countries that was also influenced by the close ties between England and Hanover. \n\nUsing the unique resources of Edinburgh University Library, I will examine the manuscript letters, library correspondence and Edinburgh University Senate minutes relating to the University library's acquisition of a rare life mask of the German poet Goethe, which was once owned by the Scottish writer and essayist Thomas Carlyle. Edinburgh University also holds Carlyle's letters, records of the Phrenological Society of Edinburgh and a collection of skull casts which may be linked to the Goethe mask. Carlyle had a special interest in German literature: Faust's Curse, Goethe's Helena, Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship and Travels, The Nibelungen Lied, Goethe's The Tale and Novelle, and Romantic fairy tales in German Romance This study will trace the history of Thomas Carlyle's replica of Goethe's life mask. The mask went through the hands of several professors at Edinburgh University.\n\nThe second part of the project focuses on Scottish Literature in the German-speaking world. I will be researching in the Bavarian State Library in Munich, for a chapter called 'The German Language Reception of Robert Burns in the Austrian Empire'. The chapter will be published in a book called The Reception of Robert Burns in Europe, edited by Murray Pittock. Not much is known about the perception of Burns in Austria. I will investigate the political importance of dialect in Burns's poetry and the reaction to the idea of the peasant poet in the Austrian Empire. \n\nI will be continuing my research in the Bavarian State Library for the third part of the project, which focuses on 'Scots in Goettingen in the Early Nineteenth Century'. This research is related to previous work that I have completed in preparation for the publication of a book, called Goettingen University in the 1820s: British and American Experiences, co-authored with Dr Essaka Joshua (Notre Dame University, IN). The chapter examines Scots' encounters with German culture, using their travel writing, letters, and translations. The Scots were young men who studied at the University of Goettingen in the 1820s (John Murray, William Weir, and George Finlay). The aim is to establish the nature of the academic network between Scotland and Germany, and to explore the extent to which universities could facilitate the dissemination of a culture. Aspects of German cultural reception in the nineteenth century will inevitably relate to the reception of Goethe. Many students met Goethe through their contacts at the university, and several went on to translate his works. These were the earliest disseminators of German literature to the English-speaking world, and their personal narratives reveal a strong appreciation of German culture. \n\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The beneficiaries of this research project are: academics, librarians, archivists and undergraduate and postgraduate students working in the following research areas: Anglo/Scottish-German Cultural Exchange, Robert Burns, Thomas Carlyle and Goethe, Goettingen University history and the relationship between German and Anglophone universities. The institutions and societies that will benefit are: Edinburgh University, Edinburgh University Library, Goettingen University, the Centre for Burns Studies in Glasgow, Anglo-German Societies in Scotland, the Goethe Institute of Glasgow, and centres for Anglo-German Studies throughout the world. Edinburgh University library will profit in particular from research into its Goethe mask; the investigation draws on specialist expertise and enhances their knowledge of its significance as a cultural object. The National Portrait Gallery of Scotland is another potential beneficiary as it has displayed masks loaned from the University of Edinburgh in the past, most notably of Sir Walter Scott and the death mask of the serial murderer William Burke of Burke and Hare infamy, complete with the markings of the noose around his neck. Potentially, this research could be used by them to professionally display the mask as a loaned piece from the library. Correspondence and discussion with the library and the gallery will be undertaken during the research phase. Full documentation of the Goethe mask's history will be of great informational value to them and would attract visitors. Students at all levels will profit from viewing this mask in a University library exhibition as an educational experience of national and local interest. A 'pilot' event in November 2010 has proved this is an attraction. Its long-term presence as an iconic image on the University of Edinburgh's German department website would draw lasting attention to its presence and the research on it. The beneficiaries of the research on Robert Burns in Austria are chiefly academics and members of the public with an interest in reading about the reputation and importance of Burns in Europe. The beneficiaries of the research on Scots in Goettingen are chiefly academics in Scotland and Germany. It is part of a book on Goettingen students that documents the early intellectual links between Britons, Americans and Germans, and reveals the effects of cultural experiences in an educational context. It has relevance to today's concept of the 'year abroad' and documents the emergence of the university study of German Literature and Language as an academic subject. It will enrich our awareness of the origins of German Studies as a discipline. \n Via publications, a future library exhibition, and a potential display in the National Gallery of Scotland, the project as a whole will contribute to the public awareness and understanding of the history of the cultural and intellectual connections between Scotland and Germany, and the reception and impact of major and minor writers and translators of the early nineteenth century. \n\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-06-12</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-09-13</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>65331</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Goethe and Schiller Relics</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5BC6FEB0-7F99-4124-A9F4-4A3587148575</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This events took place in the University of Edinburgh Library, in the Centre for Research Collections. The intended purpose is to introduce students to handwritten texts by Goethe and Schiller, important early translations and editions of their works, and the face of Goethe, in the form of the life mask, that was taken from his face during his lifetime, and copied and given to Thomas Carlyle. The event is for undergraduate students who are taking the course on &amp;quot;Goethe and Schiller&amp;quot; and visiting students. Postgraduates and postdocs who work on 18th century German literature have also attended in the past. The manuscripts introduce students to German handwriting of the 18th and 19th centuries which is written differently to the present day. I discuss my research into the Goethe mask and explain that it was possible to establish its exact history and route to Scotland via England and France. I explain the Scottish focus on German literature in the 19th century which was important for Walter Scott and Thomas Carlyle. The questionnaires reveal that this event is stimulating for knowledge of the wider impact Goethe and Schiller on the English-speaking world, because of the manuscripts and the rare life mask which gives an accurate indication of what Goethe looked like in his 50s. It also showcases local research with a wider impact and relevance and introduces final year students to the research collections, which is an archive that would otherwise remain unknown to them. The impact is measurable as at least one student in every year that I have run this event has continued their studies on a postgraduate programme. It gives undergraduates an insight into research possibilities in relation to cultural artefacts, manuscripts and rare editions.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d73d0718b2c3.57411606</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Undergraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014,2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Thomas Carlyle's Goethe Mask Revisited</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4C810E6E-157C-483F-85CD-6EB71C21ADA6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>About 15 people attended the research seminar which generated questions and discussion afterwards.

This was in the very early stages of the research and before the AHRC award for the project was granted. The event demonstrated live research, as it was my first discussion with the archivist about the rare mask. This was done in front of a live audience of undergraduates in order to give them an insight into research and how literary scholars and archivists can work together in documenting the history of cultural objects. It attracted 30 students, colleagues from the German Department, and some postgraduates, and there was also a student waiting list. After the presentations and discussion round, the student audience was invited to identify a second unidentified mask in the special collections lot and successfully established that it was Dante.

I received emails from the participating students evaluating the event very positively. Some of the students, including the student who identified the Dante mask, later went on to do postgraduate study at the University of Edinburgh.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>542a9e78037ff9.31781782</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ed.ac.uk/polopoly_fs/1.71195!fileManager/German-LibraryAndEventBasedTeaching.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:year>2010</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Robert Burns in Austria.

My visit was reported on the organisation's magazine (p. 62) as the main focus of the event at which the Working Group for Regional Language and Literature - the Salzburg Education Centre celebrated its 40th anniversary. My talk was part of the Working Group's further education programme. My lecture was commended highly by the head of the organisation as in important contribution to making local dialect poets aware of the international context and impact of dialect writing historically.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-7463488995.5292350c197fae</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.salzburgerbildungswerk.at/files/taetigkeitsbericht_2012.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>My article on Thomas Carlyle's Goethe life mask is the source of new archival information about the mask and the correspondence relating to the mask. As a result of my findings, the University of Edinburgh Library has corrected its catalogue records on the Goethe mask which it previously claimed was a death mask. The Carlyle Letters Online are also in the process of updating their records on the mask, based on this research. My lecture on the influence of Robert Burns on 19th-century Austrian dialect poetry had an educational and cultural impact on an international non-academic audience of creative writers. 40 Austrian dialect poets attended the event which broadened their horizons beyond their own regional context, informing them of how outside influences on Austrian dialect poetry, in particular Robert Burns, have occured historically.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>EDEE99B2-11E4-4910-B568-0609BFFDAE1C</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>542a96cc0a77f7.15850740</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>I achieved my main objectives for the outcomes of the project &amp;quot;Scottish-German Cultural Exchange&amp;quot; of publishing an article and a book chapter, and researching a chapter which will form part of a future book. I succeeded in achieving the goal of establishing the complete history of Thomas Carlyle's Goethe life mask, its ownership history, and its significance as a cultural relic, from the moment it was made until the present day. A negative outcome was that it was only possible to establish a direct link between the pioneers of phrenology and the mask, but no link between the Edinburgh Phrenology Society and the mask. My research proved that the claim that the Goethe mask had been lost and rediscovered in the 1980s was incorrect. It had never been lost and was always known about in the German Department of the University of Edinburgh. I also discovered new archival evidence in the form of letters and an obituary, which confirmed that Peter Hume Brown was the last owner of the mask, and found a picture of it in his biography of Goethe, which nobody knew about. I provided concrete evidence that it is not a death mask, as Carlyle scholars had previously thought. This was of benefit to the University of Edinburgh Library which holds the mask. Carlyle Letters Online will be changing their incorrect information about the mask as a result of these findings. It also led to the discovery of a Dante death mask, which Carlyle may also have once owned. My research on Robert Burns has produced an important resource for Burns scholars and researchers on the history of Austrian dialect poetry. It was published by a leading Burns scholar, Professor Murray Pittock, in a book on the complex European Reception of Robert Burns. I produced new information about the fact that the Austrian reception of Burns was dominated by a desire to identify the Germanic nature of Burns and to find linguistic and cultural common ground between Scotland and Austria. I also gave new insights into the censorship of Burns in the Austrian Empire, and explained how dependent the Austrian reception was on the German engagement with Burns. The Austrians began by producing dialect translations of Burns, which marks them out as different to the Germans, however. Whilst carrying out the research I formed new links with the German Department at the University of Salzburg, and an Austrian dialect poetry scholar at the University of Salzburg has disclosed that she will be drawing on my research on Burns in her next research paper. Contact and collaboration with her led to my giving a lecture to 40 Austrian dialect poets in Upper Austria who discussed it with me afterwards. She informs me that they have benefitted from hearing an international and historical perspective on the dialect poetry of their region. I benefitted from their knowledge of Upper Austrian dialect and cultural traditions. This research also opened up a new important research question which I am currently working on, namely subject of the German women translators of Burns in the nineteenth century.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The outcomes of my research could be used in an exhibition displaying the Goethe life mask and this could be taken forward by the University of Edinburgh library.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5213A020-2E5E-4C9E-864F-36B298020B8C</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544109fbb433e7.45777710</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>14D0B4C5-E6C0-4265-896C-3AEE48E1F4F7</gtr:id><gtr:title>THOMAS CARLYLE'S GOETHE MASK REVISITED</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>German Life and Letters</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/849e18d3f8921027e88b91fd45337965"><gtr:id>849e18d3f8921027e88b91fd45337965</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Joshua E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_55f882882255ef6d</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6D45CFB5-7AFC-4F10-A8B2-51EFCB501439</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Reception of Robert Burns in Europe</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ce6860025193367935e64fec6861bd03"><gtr:id>ce6860025193367935e64fec6861bd03</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bodammer, E.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>HB:987-1-4411-7031-6</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>545760a8e5c5e1.91213613</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>F7825E4A-C550-481D-B134-D5E9F5F80140</gtr:id><gtr:title>THOMAS CARLYLE'S GOETHE MASK REVISITED</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>German Life and Letters</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/849e18d3f8921027e88b91fd45337965"><gtr:id>849e18d3f8921027e88b91fd45337965</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Joshua E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d067067be39476</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I027436/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>9DD86EE2-EE6B-432E-AEE0-0C8669A1CBB0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Library &amp; information studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>C96AF50D-AD7C-4C61-A30E-B8619DB33BAA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Archives</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FB301405-099D-44B9-ADA9-75B11FDED8C0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>English Language &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E1C8BB85-9786-48E9-AB22-7CE39428AFD3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>German, inc.
