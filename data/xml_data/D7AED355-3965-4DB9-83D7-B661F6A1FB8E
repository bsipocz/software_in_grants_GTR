Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/L001055/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>This research takes the form of nine inter-disciplinary seminars over three years. The series, entitled 'Behaviour change' past, present and future: interdisciplinary responses to behaviour change in policy and research?, has three aims:&lt;/p>

&lt;ol>
 

 &lt;li>in response to the limited effectiveness of communication of research insights between academia and government, the seminars will provide a platform for improved dialogue between these groups&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>based on concerns about the lack of rigorous evidence around some behaviour change approaches, the seminars will provide a forum for exploring research innovation&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>given the need for interdisciplinary responses to ?behaviour change? challenges, the series will provide a structured forum for different disciplines to develop an interdisciplinary agenda.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>The three hour seminars will commence with an introductory session highlighting a range of key topics at the forefront of behaviour change research, policy and practice. Thereafter, seven seminars will focus on a particular topic of high social interest. These are obesity, food and physical activity; alcohol, drug and smoking; sustainable behaviours; corporate ?behaviour change?; mobility behaviours; civic engagement; online security/ privacy. The final seminar will synthesise cross-cutting issues and set future plans for research, application and publication.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The main beneficiaries of the research are:

- Government Policy makers
- Charities 
- Academics researching behaviour change and the influences of problem behaviours
- Industry bodies
- The general public

How will they benefit:

Government policy makers and the scientific community within Government will benefit by the opportunity to engage with behaviour change specialists across a range of topics of particular interest to policy makers. This will enable policy makers and their advisors to shape policy and the provision of public services that seek to change behaviour in a more effective way. Given the emphasis of the specific topics to be covered by the seminars, and the involvement of the Behavioural Insights Unit in the Cabinet Office in the application, we also expect tangible benefits in terms of health, sustainability, and the cost-effectiveness of service provision.

Many charities and industry bodies are also engaged in behaviour change. They will benefit through access to experts in the field, and the generation of interdisciplinary insights into how to enact effective behaviour change interventions. The full dissemination plan accompanying this bid is intended to enable as many third sector organisations as possible to share in the seminars' findings.

The field of behaviour change will also benefit through the engagement with policy, encouraged in the seminars, and the emphasis on interdisciplinary insights into behaviour change. As noted in the case for support, many different disciplines are engaged in behaviour change, but given the structures in academia there is currently limited interaction between them, or synthesis of approaches. It is this synthesis that has been recommended for the future of 'behaviour change' by important bodies such as the House of Lords Science and Technology Committee (2011) and NICE (2007). The proposed seminar series addresses this head on, and will advance not only our understanding of behaviour change, but also create new, innovative approaches that combine methods and analysis techniques from multiple disciplines.

As the recipients of behaviour change interventions, the general public will benefit through the design of more effective interventions, which will lead to improved health and wellbeing for all. These interventions will inevitably provide the most benefit to those from the more deprived and socially excluded populations. Also, the open approach of these seminars to analyzing different intervention approaches represents the team's clear aims to include all political, ideological and theoretical approaches in the conversation about effectiveness. For example, there will be an emphasis on combining top-down, designed / nudge type approaches with more participatory approaches common in social marketing and community development. This interdisciplinary approach will seek to avoid 'victim blaming' and give the 'targets' of interventions a voice that can often be overlooked.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-04-03</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-04-04</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>30393</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The impact of the seminar series has raised the profile of interdisciplinary behaviour change. The evidence for this is an invitation from Public Health England to sit on their advisory panel as they shape their future behaviour change strategy. They recognise the significance of including fields beyond behavioural insights (behavioural economics) and psychology, and have invited me to ensure inclusion from a range of perspectives. The invite was made expressly as a result of the seminar series.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2017</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>0127D670-A1BC-414C-BA0C-B0E7E5BB3C65</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>544e1dbe368492.36543024</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The seminar series is exploring the key issues in behaviour change; where we are now and where we need to be. Each seminar tackles a different area. We have had all nine seminars; focusing on key issues, physical activity, drug/acohol/smoking, sustainability, corporate behaviours, mobility, online security and civic engagement. The first was an introductory and scoping seminar and the final one picked up one of the key cross-cutting issues to come a topic of discussion in its own right. 

The key cross-cutting issue discussed in seminar nine was based on one of the key findings so far; that the nature of 'evidence' in behaviour change needs to be reconsidered. There is a tendency to require positivist, quantitative (often RCT-style) data to underpin behaviour change interventions, but this has skewed the type of interventions that are used towards more individualist, downstream types. This is because researchers tend to measure what they CAN rather than what is actually required for large scale behaviour - or even culture - change. This became a theme in the discussions, as did related discussions around the need for different types of research (including ethnography), different methodologies (including discourse analysis) and different theoretical bases (including social practice theory). The 'systems approach' to behaviour change has also cropped up a lot in discussion, meaning that activity at an upstream as well as downstream and midstream level is required for change to occur, and this may not have immediate results, yet be required to lay the foundations for change in the future. The final seminar was a discussion between 15 key thinkers in policy and academic circles who are interested in the 'policy evidence gap'. The discussion was chaired by Paul Lincoln from the UK Health Forum and included five introductory statements from different perspectives in public health and sustainability. The ensuing discussion was themed into 'problem scoping' and 'solutions'. The discussion lasted four hours and 49 pages of typed transcript have been produced. The plan is to analyse this transcript and produce a written report, academic paper and article as a result. 

In sum, the discussion concluded that there is a problem in the way that academic researchers conduct and disseminate research, which does not always meet the needs of policy makers. In addition there is a limitation in the scope of the types of research that are a) emphasised in academe and b) considered to be 'evidence' by the policy audience. One of the suggestions that came from the final seminar was for a behaviour change 'hub' to be launched which would act as a repository of advice, evidence and expertise on the full range of behaviour change thinking, research and theory that is available for policy makers and practitioners.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The discussion, captured in the synthesis documents from each seminar, might be used by speakers and delegates in their behaviour change activities.

Furthermore, the plan to produce written documents (papers, articles and policy advice) scoping out the problem of the evidence-policy gap and identifying potential solutions, may form the basis of a step change in the way that behaviour change policy is formulated and underpinned.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>179D9D15-88EF-478B-9E6F-D11D80E4A265</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544e1d814d9760.07239628</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Environment,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://esrcbehaviourchangeseminars.blogspot.co.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Public Health England behaviour change advisory committee</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6E988249-5401-4370-A393-F8138FD43B0F</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58bed7898101e4.71811247</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Membership of a guideline committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/L001055/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E844174D-6A1C-4D2D-8F24-57698F7DA353</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environmental planning</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DA22549B-026D-41FC-9204-F0CC6913B24D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Health Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>73304753-7B2F-432F-BACE-578EEECC772A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Marketing</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>56C9394E-9F52-4433-9619-6A14493473A8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AF20B57E-E40B-45BC-85C8-DDC6F4777697</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Spatial Planning</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
