Innovative models accounting for quantum effects or uncertain information are high-dimensional and hugely expensive - the lifetime of the Universe would not be enough to solve them by classical means. However, many such problems exhibit structure that if exploited can significantly reduce the computational effort. This project aims to break the complexity of high-dimensional models, and open them for routine use in computer simulation. This will be accomplished by the development of new methods that reveal hidden low-dimensional structures using classic mathematical methods, such as separation of variables and singular value decomposition. I will substantially extend the power of these methods, and apply them across a variety of important physical problems.

We know that our world is three-dimensional, so how do high-dimensional models arise? Imagine a bacterium in a lake. At any point in time it makes a move in an arbitrary direction. We cannot say definitely that the bacterium will reach a certain region in the lake and infect a plant growing there, but we can calculate the probability that this will happen. If we would like to consider all plants growing in a lake together we will have to store in computer memory the probability values for all plants. If we describe the behaviour of two bacteria at the same time, we will square the consumption of computer memory, since independent of the position of the first bacterium the second one still has the freedom to go anywhere. With an increasing number of bacteria, the amount of data explodes exponentially and quickly exhausts any reasonable memory. So the term &amp;quot;dimension&amp;quot; refers to the number of bacteria, and is naturally very high.

However, if bacteria move independently it is enough to store probability values just for one of them: the joint probability of the overall situation in the lake is then simply the product of the marginal probabilities. In reality, the bacteria will interact to some extent with near-by bacteria and will be influenced by the ambient flow in the lake. However, it is highly unlikely that a bacterium on one side of the lake will be affected by bacteria at the other. So the volume of data that effectively approximates the whole system will be many orders of magnitude smaller than the total number of degrees of freedom. The concept of high dimension in this example is in fact ubiquitous. An airplane, experiencing a fluctuating load on its wings, quantum effects unravelled by a magnetic resonance spectrometer, circadian rhythms or virus replication - all these phenomena are described by high-dimensional models. I will design methods that set new levels of prediction accuracy in these existing models, in particular such vital problems as subsurface flows of pollutants in an uncertain medium or stochastic virus dynamics, and extend the class of problems that can be tackled.

The new methods I am going to develop combine a range of mathematical techniques. The tensor product concept is a powerful data compression method, but it is in fact nothing more than an immediate generalisation of the separation of variable concept for continuous functions that can be accurately computed via the singular value decomposition. The workhorses in the tensor product framework are alternating optimisation algorithms. Their convergence can be substantially enhanced by employing ideas from classical Krylov iterative methods for matrix equations. I will extend tensor product methods further, and embody them in publicly available software with transparent user interfaces to popular scientific packages in order to encourage other researchers to try the new methodology in real-life problems.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>* Academic dissemination

Tensor product methods can be interesting for different beneficiaries in both applied mathematics and in physics, chemistry and biology, which are closer to real problems. Efficient data compression techniques based on separation of variables could become a method of choice for complex stochastic models that otherwise require too much computational effort with existing methods. To name just a few examples:
 - Monte Carlo-based methods for uncertainty quantification may require the solution of thousands or even millions of high-resolution deterministic problems, and take days or months to complete.
 - Stochastic models of virus replication in vaccine design have been avoided for a long time due to their high complexity, despite the fact that replication of viruses is an intrinsically stochastic process.
 - State of the art model reduction methods in magnetic resonance spectroscopy do make it possible to simulate NMR experiments for proteins, but they still consume up to a terabyte of shared memory. To compare: our preliminary tensor product calculations for the pulse-acquire model (one of the simplest experiments) needed a couple of gigabytes, and were tractable on a laptop.
 - Leading Density Functional Theory software packages are still prohibitively expensive, and may take weeks to simulate a point defect in a crystal with extremely simplified boundary conditions.
New numerical methods can reduce the amount of high-load scientific computations, and by that cut down the energy consumption of supercomputers. Besides, if new accurate models are available for numerical simulations, we will have more chances to discover some new physical phenomena, and broaden our understanding of nature.

To disseminate my work I will publish mathematical aspects, descriptions of algorithms and their analysis in top rated mathematical journals (SIAM, LAA), complemented by papers in physical journals (JCP, CPC, Phys. Review), to present results of the application of tensor product methods to particular problems in collaboration with experts in these areas. To provide equal opportunity to access to these publications, I will accompany journal articles with up to date preprint versions. I will also continue to give talks at major international and UK conferences to engage other researchers with my project. I plan to attend several established annual conferences in applied mathematics (see Justification of resources for details), as well as some events in application areas, which will be identified together with my beneficiaries (for example, I was invited to the 9th European Conference on Mathematical and Theoretical Biology). I will be also glad to visit local workshops and seminars
organised by collaborators.

* Software development and user support

Numerical algorithms are often only as good as their particular software implementation. The main reason why tensor approximation methods based on the singular value decomposition have quickly become preferred to generic error minimisation techniques (such as the Newton method) is the incredible efficiency and reliability of the SVD algorithm realised in LAPACK and MKL libraries. I am going to take into account my previous experience and the needs in applications to develop a versatile multi-level tensor product software package which will be made openly available.

To encourage beneficiaries to try the new methodology in their applications, I will implement a MATLAB interface to tensor product algorithms, with as transparent overloading as possible. It will be complemented by high-performance low-level codes for computationally demanding problems. The software will be accompanied by an extensive documentation and typical benchmark and tutorial examples. An open-source toolkit with quick start possibilities will make an instant impact on recognition of tensor product methods in a broad community and I see the biggest impact of this project to come from this.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>220665</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Computational Mathematics and Applications Seminar, University of Oxford, UK, February 11, 2016.</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9977AE9A-B28E-43D7-A9A8-511053771F6A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>&amp;quot;Computational Mathematics and Applications&amp;quot; is a series of weekly seminars held at the Mathematical institute of the University of Oxford.

Tensor product algorithms allow to compute a reduced model without ever solving the full original problem.
However, an optimal control of such systems is more challenging.
It requires solving optimality equations, which led to instabilities in existing tensor algorithms.
In the framework of the project, I developed a new technique that mitigates this issue by reducing forward, adjoint and gradient equations separately.
It allowed fast modelling of inverse stochastic problems in fluid dynamics (http://dx.doi.org/10.1137/15M1040414 and http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cma.2016.02.004).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Fast computation of an optimal control under a lack of knowledge should allow researchers and engineers to investigate more scenarios and designs of a technological process in a timely manner.
