People with serious mental illness frequently have low socioeconomic status, sedentary lifestyles, poor diets and smoking is common. All of these are recognised risk factors for heart disease. In addition, some medication used to treat symptoms of serious mental illness increase the risk of weight gain and diabetes, further increasing the risk of heart disease. It is unclear whether these risk factors are the reason for the increased risk of heart disease in those with serious mental illness, or whether the biology of serious mental illness overlaps with the biology of heart disease. 
Many variations in an individual's DNA (genetic material) are known to increase the risk of serious mental illness. This project will firstly investigate whether these variations also have an effect on diabetes and heart disease. Secondly, this project will determine whether these variations are able to identify people with highest risk of heart disease. Finally, this project will examine whether low socioeconomic status and lifestyle factors have an even great effect on heart disease risk when combined with these genetic variations.
The results of this project will improve understanding of how serious mental illness develops. If the biology of serious mental illness overlaps with heart disease, then drugs used to treat heart disease might be improve treatment for serious mental illness. If DNA variations linked to serious mental illness can improve prediction of heart disease risk or do interact with socioeconomic or lifestyle factors, then heart disease risk can be better managed, by individuals, doctors and policy-makers.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>An urgent question facing health researchers is why individuals with serious mental illness have not benefited in recent advances in cardiovascular prevention. My research investigates possible reasons for this by combining health, genetic and social/lifestyle data with statistical and genetic approaches. Firstly, I will determine whether there are common mechanisms underlying the increased risk of cardiometabolic disease in people with mood disorders. Secondly, I will assess the extent to which low socioeconomic status interacts with these mechanisms. Finally, I will explore whether genetic predisposition to serious mental illness can identify subsets of individuals with distinct cardiovascular risk profiles. 
I will utilise European research cohorts, as well as real-world data. The research cohorts (specifically the IMPROVE (European high cardiovascular risk cohort) and PROCARDIS (European coronary artery disease case-control) studies) have been extensively phenotyped for cardiometabolic metabolic variables. The real-world data (specifically PsyCIS (an ongoing study of &amp;gt;10,000 individuals with serious mental illness and/or psychosis within the NHSGGC Safe Haven) and UK Biobank (a population study of ~500,000 individuals with genetic, clinical and lifestyle/social data as well as linkage to NHS records) allow for long-term follow-up. The UKBiobank is particularly valuable for analyses of lifestyle and socioeconomic data. Standard genetic and epidemiological methods will be used for objectives 1 and 2 respectively. Objective 3 will repurpose quality control methodology in an innovative manner.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-02-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-02-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>323270</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/S003061/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
