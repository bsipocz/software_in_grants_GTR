'Public engagement with research' goes beyond uni-directional dissemination to involve individuals and communities in two-way reflexive interactions intended to inform, inspire, involve, upskill and enrich. Public engagement is vitally important to universities as it increases the actual and perceived value of research to wider society, builds research capacity and broadens research horizons. 

Research context

Public engagement with research (PER) is an emerging practice-centred field which over the last 15 years has advanced understanding the need for university researchers to engage with wider, stimulated increased PER activity, and advanced understanding of the impact of public engagement with research and the mechanisms which are most effective for nurturing quality, reach and impact in PER. Many UK universities have signed RCUK's Concordat for Engaging the Public with Research and the National Coordinating Centre for Public Engagement (NCCPE)'s Manifesto for Public Engagement. However, PER is still not consistently valued by researchers or research managers and support provided for PER is not consistently high. 

Aims/objectives 

The University of Lincoln is a post-1992 university with a growing reputation for research and a strong commitment to, and track record in, public engagement. However, analysis with NCCPE's Edge Tool has shown that, lacking the resources of many larger and older institutions, support for PER at the university is not consistently of the highest standard. PEARL aims to improve this in order to benefit wider publics and researchers and act as a model for other HEIs. PEARL's objectives contribute to a wider Strategy for PER and focus on identified needs to strengthen the support for, and visibility of, PER. 

Methods

PEARL will firstly carry out a series of surveys to provide detailed baseline data about attitudes to the provision of, and support for, PER at the university, and assess the full extent of PE currently carried out at the university. These data will then enable the impact of PEARL interventions to be evaluated, and will also identify what improvements in support for PER need to be introduced. Next, four training workshops will be developed in response to researchers' identified requirements, and a database of current PER activity (including researchers, subjects, publics) created. A dedicated PER microsite within the university website will be designed to act as a landing strip and portal for information and news about research and how wider publics can engage with it, including a blog, archives of previous PER activity and resources from workshops and research. Six new PER activities will test the new PER support systems and provide exemplars for others. New systems for rewarding PER will be devised and taken through necessary university committees, and formats for an Annual Conference and Annual Report on PER will be devised and inaugural event/issue run/published. The impact of all activity will be evaluated using a range of methods and evidence.

Benefits

PEARL will benefit members of wider publics including adults, school pupils and community/voluntary sector groups, city councils, county councils, tourist bodies, local businesses, public engagement enablers, NCCPE, researchers, policy makers and universities. Benefits will include PER which is better designed, targeted and evaluated; wider publics with a more informed knowledge of the benefits of research and how to engage with it; new PER activity, improved understanding of the efficacy of different ways of supporting PER and improved understanding of the benefits of PER to wider publics. Impacts will reach beneficiaries in person, via conferences and academic publications and online.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Achieving wider impact is integral to PEARL as it aims to enhance the processes used to support public engagement with research in order to ensure that this can be more effectively embedded and delivered across and beyond the institution. By advancing sectoral understanding of how and why different support strategies for publicly engaged researchers work PEARL will propagate down-the-line benefits to academia and wider publics in the form of wider publics better engaged with university research. Key impacts will be:

1. Better understanding of what motivates publics to engage with research. This will benefit researchers and PER practitioners by enabling them better to design and target their PER activity, and benefit wider publics as improved PER provision can be targeted to meet their wants and needs.

2. University research will be more visible and accessible. Wider publics will benefit as they will be able to find and follow information about research and how to engage more easily; tourism organisations and local businesses will be able to promote research engagement opportunities to visitors and benefit from visitor trade; researchers and PER practitioners will be able to access models for successful PER.

3. Greater volume and range of PER activity. This will benefit wider publics as it will enable greater numbers of people to engage with research more often and in more diverse ways, reaching and meeting a wider range of aspirations and needs and more effectively engaging, informing, inspiring and upskilling. Researchers will benefit from more opportunities to develop PE experience and transferrable skills and from their research being better known and understood.

4. Improved public understanding of research, its benefits, and the benefits of engaging with. Wider publics will benefit as they will be better able to access the benefits that research and research engagement can deliver if they know what these benefits are likely to be; researchers and HEIs will benefit from their research being better understood and valued.

5. Better understanding of the efficacy of different methods of supporting PER. This will benefit researchers and HEIs as developing and embedding improved support will encourage more researchers to engage wider publics with their work, and will improve the quality of the activity on offer. It will benefit PER enablers, HEIs and policy makers by enabling effective strategies to be disseminated across the HE sector in order to propagate more widely the benefits above. It will benefit wider publics by making more and better public engagement more widely available.

6. Better understanding of the benefits to wider publics of engaging with research. This will benefit wider publics firstly because engagement activity can be better designed to achieve and record ve those benefits while public knowledge of the benefits of PE will create a virtuous circle encouraging greater uptake of PER opportunities. It will benefit researchers and PER enablers as they will be better able to demonstrate the positive value of their work; and will benefit policy makers as they will be able to justify adaptations to policies to support effective public engagement with research, and to increase the amount of PER activity.

The dissemination strategy for ensuring the benefits above reach their intended beneficiaries includes discussions at collaborative SEE-PER quarterly meetings; presentations at internal, external and international conferences; publications ranging from peer-reviewed academic journals to local press; online via a dedicated website and social media; local and national radio; partnership working with local tourist offices and businesses.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>60441</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R019657/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
