The collapse of buildings at the World Trade Centre (WTC) has thrown the field of structural engineering into the spotlight and professionals and the public alike have a heightened awareness of the dangers posed by the collapse of buildings. The post-WTC deliberations have highlighted and brought into sharp focus a previously limited debate on the shortcomings in our knowledge of the response of framed buildings to accidental or malicious damage. Even before the September 11 attacks, an American government working party stated that Progressive structural collapse is a primary, if not the leading, cause of injury and death in building failures, regardless of the source of loading...For this reason, predicting and designing to prevent progressive collapse of a building under a specified attack scenario is (and should be) a primary objective... The same report noted that ...guidance on building collapse and building code requirements would be valuable. The phenomenon of progressive collapse is not well understood, despite the widespread recognition that most building failures include building collapse. Although building codes admonish designers to ensure that collapse does not occur, they do not provide guidance on how this can or should be accomplished. Among their recommendations is The nature and mechanism of progressive collapse is a subject that merits further study by the academic community. This topic, which has not been addressed at a meaningful level for almost a quarter of a century, could have benefits in mitigating risks from many hazards. The situation in the United Kingdom is similar. A pre-September 11 report acknowledged that, whilst the requirement for structures to be robust against accidental damage is not disputed, there is presently no established basis for determining how much redundancy is required in order to provide an acceptable level of safety in the event of damage, or to estimate how the forces in a damaged structure are redistributed. The same report pointed out that, inherent robustness of buildings may have been compromised by advances in structural analysis and design, which have enabled the designer to model a structure more accurately. This, it argued, has reduced the usual over-design of structural frames in the pursuit of economy of construction, and may have resulted in buildings with reduced robustness. Although current UK design guidelines emphasise the importance of catenary action in providing robustness against damage in framed buildings, and the consequent requirement for tensile capacity of members and connections, in practice, it is likely that both moment resistance (in Virendeel bridging action) and shear resistance (to debris loading) of connections will be equally important. Recent authoritative publications in both the UK and USA have highlighted the current lack of knowledge of the dynamic response of bolted steel connections and there is a pressing need for authoritative data on both the response of different types of framed structures to damage (a topic already under investigation by the proposers and the subject of an earlier research proposal), and the dynamic behaviour of steel connections.The overall aim of this project is to conduct an experimental study of the response of steel connections to dynamic loading and compare the results with existing design recommendations. A range of connections typical of those used in UK construction will be examined, including web cleats, fin plates, partial depth- , flush- and extended endplates.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>344600</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Qinetiq</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>UK MoD Force Protection Engineering Research Programme</gtr:description><gtr:id>B3E46971-F259-416B-B025-93D3F7C2CF98</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>b98cac94b98caca8-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:piContribution>The research teams run by Andy Tyas at University of Sheffield and Mike Byfield at Southampton University have collaborated on several publications in the field both during and following the period of this grant.



Both research teams are currently part of the QinetiQ plc-led consortium running the UK MoD Force Protection Engineering (FPE) research programme. In this work, the UoS/SU teams are conducting fundamental and applied research on the behaviour of steel connections in protective structures subjected to military attack. Facilities and expertise developed during this EPSRC project are being directly applied to the FPE work.

The context of this work is that, should a steel-framed building be damaged by, say a vehicle impact or a terrorist bombing, leading to the loss of one or more of the main columns, the rest of the structure has to re-distribute the structural load. This requires connections to rapidly take up new deformations and loads. Prior to this work, there was no experimental data on the load capacity and failure mechanisms of connections at fast loading rates. This work has developed an experimental facility for conducting this work, and has produced detailed data on the performance of typical connections. Some have been found to perform similarly at high rates to their behaviour under quasi-static loading, whereas others have exhibited significant loss of ductility at higher loading rates. Models for predicting connection response have been developed which may be useful in analyses of damaged building frames.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The results from our work can be used to validate computational models of connection behaviour, identifying weaknesses and in the fullness of time, helping to develop more resilient connection details.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>73897C5E-38F0-4A6D-AAD7-EB1C5AB9AC9B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56a202a56c5140.73260796</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Construction</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>608E8013-586D-463E-8469-BC9A83705435</gtr:id><gtr:title>Web shear failure of angle-cleat connections loaded at high rates</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Constructional Steel Research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4a77de7807187e482f8939da4314cf4b"><gtr:id>4a77de7807187e482f8939da4314cf4b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rahbari R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5675fc78a1759</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>34890444-362B-4424-B5A6-0A00B5F7534D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Investigating the Robustness of Steel Beam-to-Column Connections</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/3b7672417118a57e41f6366a2683f429"><gtr:id>3b7672417118a57e41f6366a2683f429</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Buick Davison</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>r_3029609632cac5308e</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C832206F-77D1-46BE-9B10-131DBA18B97F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Robustness of Steel Connections</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/57009a449444792a48a4efce6c6fca3c"><gtr:id>57009a449444792a48a4efce6c6fca3c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>davison jb</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2008-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>r_6712510487cac72f42</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>FF5081EC-1DA0-4931-86A7-9F943597CE9B</gtr:id><gtr:title>A Methodology for Combined Rotation-Extension Testing of Simple Steel Beam to Column Joints at High Rates of Loading</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Experimental Mechanics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/427481f724af599e5d79c6bd2a4c052f"><gtr:id>427481f724af599e5d79c6bd2a4c052f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Tyas A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cfdffdf442c933</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>6039271D-C835-4B18-A931-28666D512653</gtr:id><gtr:title>Numerical Simulation of Steel Bolted Beam-Column Connections Subjected to Dynamic Loading</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Applied Mechanics and Materials</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/deb46507a842de11e1eed7b3fe258ac7"><gtr:id>deb46507a842de11e1eed7b3fe258ac7</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Chang L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d088088b92e9e3</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>40BDD1DE-2347-48C7-B870-24EDFF761210</gtr:id><gtr:title>Dynamic testing of semi-rigid steel beam-column connections</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/45303e685d265eab20c82c497d4814db"><gtr:id>45303e685d265eab20c82c497d4814db</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Andrew Tyas</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>r_4781216078cac3a188</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>FC249DC6-127A-4105-8CEF-72773DD8E1AC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Strain rate dependent component based connection modelling for use in non-linear dynamic progressive collapse analysis</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Engineering Structures</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4d3fb9b0098205bd96bc3055f8291960"><gtr:id>4d3fb9b0098205bd96bc3055f8291960</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Stoddart E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53cff0ff0767d587</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/F004338/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C087E953-30F3-4968-B0F3-D48A5998A2B4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Civil eng. &amp;
