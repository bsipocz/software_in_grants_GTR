In stark contrast the heavier chalcogen (sulphur, selenium, tellurium) containing homologs of these oxygen containing metal organophosphonates have attracted far less attention, predominately due to a lack of a reliable synthetic route to these systems.

We now propose to exploit our recent advances in this area by carrying out a full study on the reactivity and coordination chemistry of these new compounds as well as extending our synthetic route to prepare novel compounds containing two or more trichalcogenophosphonate groups.These new compounds and materials will be studied for a variety of applications including as new porous materials for the removal of heavy metal contaminants such as mercury and arsenic from contaminated water supplies. Organophosphonate based materials are already used in water treatment for the removal of limescale whereby the hard calcium metal ion binds strongly to the hard oxygen atoms in the organophosphonate group. Replacement of one or more of the oxygens with the larger, softer sulphur atom in our new compounds will result in a new material capable of binding strongly to larger, softer metal ions such as mercury cations, hence removing them from the water supply.In addition we will study the use of these trichalcogenophosphonate compounds as reagents for the synthesis of organic and bio-organic compounds, for example in the conversion of ketones (R2C=O) to thioketals (R2C=S). It is expected that their much increased solubility in polar solvents over existing reagents for this reaction will allow the use of less harsh and more green-chemistry conditions (lower temperatures and less solvent).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>126654</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, commodity fine chemicals and functionalised materials all have a massive impact on the quality of life for each and every individual alive today, no-matter their age, health, occupation or country of residence.

To this end the research goals achieved in this programme, most notably the establishment and study of a new class of heavier-chalcogen organophosphonate , will prospectively lead to small but significant impacts in these industries over future years with consequential societal and economic benefits.</gtr:description><gtr:id>CFF71329-6E1C-4330-9344-7542EBA6A420</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545ce168207423.44576729</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Metal organophosphonates have been extensively studied over the last thirty years due to their potential and practical applications as ion exchangers, sorbents, sensors, proton conductors, nonlinear optical materials, catalysts and hosts for the intercalation of a broad spectrum of guests.

In stark contrast the heavier chalcogen (sulphur, selenium, tellurium) containing homologs of these oxygen containing metal organophosphonates have attracted far less attention, predominately due to a lack of a reliable synthetic route to these systems.
This project has led to the development of a new, clean, and high yielding route to trichalcogenophosphonates containing three sulphur or three selenium atoms in place of the three oxygen atoms in metal organophosphonates. These new compounds and materials are of interest for a variety of applications including as new porous materials for the removal of heavy metal contaminants such as mercury and arsenic from contaminated water supplies: Organophosphonate based materials are already used in water treatment for the removal of limescale whereby the hard calcium metal ion binds strongly to the hard oxygen atoms in the organophosphonate group. Replacement of one or more of the oxygens with a larger, softer sulphur atom can result in a new material capable of binding strongly to larger, softer metal ions such as mercury cations, hence removing them from the water supply.
The initial synthetic route to trichalcogenophosphonates developed in this project involved the reaction of primary phosphines with a metallating agent and elemental chalcogen. Although this preparative route proved highly successful, leading to the attainment of many new chemical compounds and complexes, it was thought that difficulties in the handling and availability of air-sensitive primary phosphines would curtail any widespread academic or industrial uptake. The synthetic route was therefore further refined to allow the use of organophosphonate ester starting materials. Organophosphonate esters are cheap, air-stable, easy to handle and readily available, thus widening the scope of available organo groups and facilitating the further exploitation of trichalcogenophosphonates.
During the course of this work, a number of novel phosphorus-chalcogen containing compounds and complexes have been prepared and fully characterised. Many of the new compounds were shown to exhibit unique structures and bonding motifs which had been previous unreported. These new compounds and materials were also subjected to preliminary studies to probe their potential applications in a variety of fields including metal extraction technologies for mining and water purification, as single-source precursors for the preparation of metal chalcogenide materials and quantum dots, and as reagents for the synthesis of thio- or seleno-containing organic and bio-organic compounds.
In addition to the above scientific advances, the project also resulted in the full training and qualification of a new Ph.D. chemist.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The novel trichalcogenophosphonates and their complexes prepared in this project are of interest as heavier chalcogen homologs of metal organophosphonates with corresponding potential applications as ion exchangers, sorbents, sensors, proton conductors, nonlinear optical materials and catalysts.
