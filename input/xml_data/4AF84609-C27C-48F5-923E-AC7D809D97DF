i) poor quantitative understanding of how intrinsic hydrological, geomorphological and ecological factors influence biogas and nutrient recycling/release in the active layer and its interface with the upper permafrost
ii) poor knowledge on how such changes in permafrost characteristics and function of the active layer influence the adjacent coastal marine ecosystems. 

The direct and indirect impact of permafrost changes on the Arctic GHG budget can only be reliably predicted when these key problems have been resolved with quantitative estimates. The necessary modelling platforms to quantitatively describe the relevant processes and their interactions within the system already exist, and it is the need for new process understanding to forecast dynamic impacts on climate change that is the most urgent consideration. We have therefore assembled an international multidisciplinary consortium with expertise in hydrology (Solovyanova); permafrost dynamics and geomorphology (Christiansen), biogeochemistry (Hodson and Yde), redox geochemistry (Thornton, Finster) and microbiology (Finster) to provide this information. It is further augmented by leading experts in regional modelling (Romanovsky, De'Ath), ecosystem change and biogeochemistry (Rysgaard, Tranter and Vincent) and isotope geochemistry (Heaton and Bennett), who add significant value as Project Partners. 

We will conduct an integrated field, laboratory and modelling study of sites from relatively warm Svalbard in Norway, eastwards into colder Siberia, covering the entire Arctic permafrost gradient. We will construct &amp;quot;field observatories&amp;quot; in important thaw environments, including yedoma terraces, ice wedge polygons, raised marine wetlands and deltas. In each case we will collect cores for laboratory studies and conduct field monitoring to construct mass balance models that describe their integrated GHG forcing potential. Laboratory studies will determine (i) how biogeochemical and microbiological conditions change with depth, from the active layer into the permafrost, and (iii) how changing temperature and moisture regimes influence the microbial communities and their functional potential for C and nutrient processing at these depths. In this way we will quantitatively link the biogeochemical conditions to the physical and functional differences between the permafrost types, establishing their potential for microbially-mediated GHG production and nutrient export to marine ecosystems. The potential impact of nutrient and organic matter export from lowland permafrost on marine ecosystem production will then be estimated by amending incubations of sea water with runoff from the different field observatories. Two workshops will provide crucial fora for establishing the integration of permafrost GHG feedbacks into the next generation of regional biogeophysical models, while also allowing our scientific contribution and its wider societal importance to be showcased. We will also establish the field observatories as innovative learning resources for future students visiting the Arctic university of Svalbard.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>1) Policy Makers
We have planned direct dissemination to policy makers in the EU through the European Environment Agency and workshop invitations to key personnel. The EEA promises to engage with projects like ours by encouraging use of the Shared Environmental Information System (SEIS), which also gathers pan-European environmental data collected via the EU's European Environment Information and Observation Network. We will invite key persons from the EU to our second workshop, including Anne Bergenfelt, the advisor to Connie Hedegaard, who is the European Commissioner for Climate Action. Anne is responsible for research and development within the field and would therefore be sent Project-related materials produced by a science writer. Second, Anna Johansson is Head of Communications in the Climate Action Directorate General DG CLIMA and is influential with respect to the calls made during the EU's Horizon 2020. 

2) Members of the public
Public engagement events will involve advertised public lectures and debates in the UK, Norway and Denmark. We will focus upon how different the perceptions among our public audiences are, since they will range from the world's northernmost permanent community (Svalbard) to major European cities. Sheffield has much to benefit from these events, because they will inform the public how resource exploitation in Svalbard (our principal study area) underpinned some of the city's industrial development during the 1900s (Spitsbergen Coal Trading Company). They will also learn about how the fate of this venture changed lives in Norway by convincing policy makers of the need for an international agreement on resource exploitation and other aspects of environmental management and governance via the Svalbard Treaty. 

School children and students will also be informed of LowPerm research, which will be condensed into brochure form for dissemination in English, Norwegian, Danish and Russian. Students will be invited to two workshops, where they will be exposed to research presentations from an interdisciplinary group. The knowledge transfer to students and schoolchildren will be enhanced by a Science Writers' Competition and use of Sheffield's Writers in Residence programme.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-03-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>321889</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>CPD Event for A Level teachers</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>91593549-F0DB-4A90-9191-52271F74764C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We designed new learning resources for the field, laboratory and computer-based learning on carbon in water with a specific emphasis on the new A Level curriculum.
