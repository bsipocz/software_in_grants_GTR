The present project provides a novel solution by using insights from those with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, who are known to excessively monitor (eg, &amp;quot;Did I turn the oven off?&amp;quot;), and apply this to those who don?t monitor their finances.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The research will examine which cognitive factors explain why debtors fail to adequately monitor their debt. Then examine debtors? attentional biases with debt-related stimuli and how this relates to how they monitor their finances. This information will be used to modify how debtors interact with debt-related stimuli, and quantify its influence on financial behaviours. Finally, this will be applied to the design of a Manage Your Debt Application System (MYDAS) mobile phone intervention which aims to improve how debtors monitor their debt.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This research will have the following implications:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>&lt;strong>Science:&lt;/strong> By providing an empirical understanding of the thought process of debtors and an intervention to change those thought processes key to debt.&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>&lt;strong>Society:&lt;/strong> By providing new tools to identify problem debtors and interventions (MYDAS) the research will benefit debtors (reduce debt), creditors (repayment) and debt agencies.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Debt and reducing personal debt are the focus of significant and sustained attention, both in the UK and internationally. For example, in the last year there was a 48% increase in family household debt suggesting that people are falling further into debt as financial constraints tighten. However, despite this the psychological underpinnings of debt have remained elusive with empirically validated interventions non-existent. In filling this gap my research will benefit the following.

DEBTORS. The end point of this research is to produce an empirically validated intervention called 'Manage Your Debt Application System' (MYDAS) which will be made freely downloadable to the mobile phones of debtors and will be accessible on the project website (see: http://mydasresearch.org.uk/). I will also target these key beneficiaries by challenging the 'debt as taboo' through my project website, improving debt seeking advice and/or repayment and improving mental health outcomes. In addition, my research will bring to the fore that debtors and those who ignore their debt specifically need to be considered as a unique group with their own cognitive profile, needs, demands, and problems. 

DEBT HELP AGENCIES. As I will work in close collaboration with a number of debt help agencies: Citizens Advice (Sheffield and UK wide), Consumer Credit Counselling Service, Debt Advice Foundation, National Debtline, and Debt Support Trust, this research will serve these key beneficiaries by providing an empirically grounded understanding of the psychological mechanisms underlying debt and debt avoidance. For example, working alongside my project partner Steve Wilcox (Sheffield Citizens Advice Debt Unit: CAD) with the aim of rolling out MYDAS within Sheffield and the UK - 17 interlinked CAD Units Nationwide - this research will influence debt policy by showing that debtors have specific cognitive profiles requiring specifically tailored interventions. 

CREDITORS. Another set of beneficiaries are creditors companies and organizations, such as, Her Majesty's Court Services, Utility (Electric, Water), Local Authorities and Debt Collection Agencies. These downstream beneficiaries will benefit as MYDAS proposes to increase financial monitoring leading to increased likelihood of seeking debt advice and/or debt repayment. 

SOCIAL AND CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY. Improving monitoring has traditionally focused on using external tools to induce behaviour change. This research provides the new insight that we can borrow from cases of pathologically monitoring in Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and then apply these same mechanisms to debtors. This may help change a view that clinical disorders are not always a negative endpoint per se but rather, in specific instances, can inform a means of positive behaviour change. 

COMPUTING SCIENCE. Computing science as an intervention tool is receiving increased attention. Critically, my research will impact this field by targeting the ESRC strategic aim to 'Influence Behaviour and Inform Intervention.' Wherein, I highlight the mechanisms of different behaviours (i.e., debtors vs. non-debtors) and apply interventions specifically designed to these problematic behaviours (i.e., MYDAS). Advancing knowledge of how mobile phones can positively change behaviour is evidence of the broad impact my work will have. 

SCIENCE MUSEUMS/GALLERIES. With science communicator Simon Watt (from Channel 4s: Inside Natures Giants) we will collaborate to produce an exhibit of my work, with an emphasis on MYDAS, to impact a range of non-scientific beneficiaries. As a result, my project will make central contributions to public knowledge of the psychological underpinnings of debt, the health concerns of debt, and interventions to debt, i.e., MYDAS.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-12-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>230266</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>GAP Property</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Improving rent payment completion rates in an impoverished sample</gtr:description><gtr:id>237902BA-BD8F-4272-9C2A-DA6747CB91AD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>At present the study is about to commence, with data collection estimated to be complete in July of 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dd8eafde0b61.95475596-1</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>At this stage I am working on this study alone.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>A study is presently being designed in collaboration with a Mr Luke Piggot who works for GAP Property: Property Rental Agency at 1 Town Hall St, Grimsby, DN31 1HE.

His project is similar to mine in that he will be be working in partnership with the Citizens Advice Bureau and Money Advice Service in Leeds and in Bradford. The aim of the project is help develop financial advice service provision so that it incorporates some degree of understanding of the psychological barriers that might interfere with people's ability to address their financial difficulty (things like agency, self-efficacy, and stress coping skills). These things are often overlooked as CAB advisors must focus on the more practical aspects of their clients situations-getting the bills paid, dealing with the creditors, benefits issues etc.

Our collaboration will seek to understand the manner in which key psychological factors (i.e., financial estimates, avoidance, stress) influence the manner in which people deal with an upcoming financial event, i.e., Christmas, going on holiday, buying a car, etc. For example, it may be that those who tend to avoid financial outcomes (i.e., don't look at their bank balance), then more poorly underestimate how much they need so spend on Christmas, which in turn results in greater stress and poorer financial decision-making.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>My work with the Chesterfield and East Derbyshire Credit Union has shown them that psychological intervention can be successfully employed within a real world setting and benefit them in terms of improving the quality of the information (i.e., income and expense estimates) that they provided.

In conjunction with my recently hired research assistant, we are presently testing participants with a classic approach-avoidance task with the aim of testing if this can improve financial decision making (i.e., less avoidance of financial information).

The abstract for two studies associated with this are:

Many people avoid dealing with their debts to the point that they are burdened with
significant financial, legal and health problems. Across two studies, we show experimentally
that debt-related stimuli prime avoidance and identify cognitive bias modification (CBM)
tasks that can be used to reduce this bias. To measure avoidance biases we used a priming
task where debt-related visual stimuli were briefly presented followed by target words related
to approach and avoidance. Across both experiments, debt avoidance biases were found.
Participants initially made faster responses to the avoidance compared to the approach words
when preceded by debt stimuli. In experiment 1, participants then completed an approachavoidance
task (AAT) in which they were required to repeatedly pull a joystick, which
incidentally made debt stimuli become larger on the screen. In experiment 2, participants
completed an attentional bias modification (ABM) task in which they had to respond to a dot
probe repeatedly presented at a location incongruent with a preceding debt stimulus acting as
a spatial cue. We found that only the AAT reduced avoidance priming by debt stimuli,
although both CBM paradigms reduced negative valence and arousal ratings. Our findings
suggest that debt-related stimuli prime avoidance and that an AAT can reduce this
association. Attentional bias modification may have maintained the avoidance bias due to it
being a form of informational avoidance. We suggest that the next step will be for studies to
establish if the AAT can be usefully applied to reduce debt amongst debtors.</gtr:description><gtr:id>C7783299-7CE9-4A38-8375-44B1933D5FFD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>These studies have recently been submitted to the Journal of Neuroscience, Psychology and Economics.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56dea193ab9053.62602486</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Approach-Avoidance Study</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>76C777C9-23EA-44F2-A351-0F5FC902C846</gtr:id><gtr:title>Do Psychological Measures Predict Debt Problems?
