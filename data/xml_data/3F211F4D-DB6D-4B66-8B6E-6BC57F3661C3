The edition will be divided into two volumes, one of which will consist almost entirely of 'Hesperides', the single collection which Herrick published in 1648. The other will gather for the first time the somewhat different corpus of poems which circulated in manuscript form, copied from one collection to another, during Herrick's lifetime, and on which his reputation rested before 1648. \nThough Herrick's critical reputation has fluctuated over the centuries, he has almost always been recognised as a lyric poet of great grace and wit. More recently, 'Hesperides' has been seen to possess a unity which makes it more than the sum of its many and apparently heterogeneous parts (it contains over 1,400 mainly short poems). This unity has been variously located by modern critics in such overarching concepts as ceremony, transience, the classical epigram book, and the presence of a semi-fictional, carefully characterised version of the poet himself. Herrick has also been recognised in recent times as a major figure in the development of the concept of 'authorship' in England, the first poet to publish what amounted to his own definitive 'Collected Poems' as a summary of his life's work. Such critical themes, nearly all of them products of the fifty years that have elapsed since the last major edition of Herrick's work, will be analyzed in a new introduction, as will recently discovered biographical information that bears on his writing. \nJust as important as a general introduction for the modern reader of Herrick is a commentary on his poems. Despite their deceptive ease and grace, they depend for much of their complex effect on allusions that his contemporaries would have recognised, but which are now lost. Often these are echoes of the Bible or of Latin, Greek and French writers, or of his immediate predecessors, especially Jonson and Shakespeare. Herrick also alludes, however, to contemporary social and political events and persons, and to popular custom and ceremony. All such references need to be explained, and the enormous resources of searchable databases unavailable to previous editors will allow a richer and clearer picture to be drawn of Herrick's place in the literary tradition.\nAt the centre of this project, however, are the poems themselves, and the highest priority of a new edition is to provide the reader with texts of Herrick's poetry which are as close as possible to what he intended. In the case of 'Hesperides' this will be achieved by a painstaking collation of twenty different copies of the 1648 edition, tracing corrections which were made during the course of printing, not all of which are likely to have been recorded by earlier editors. In the case of the sixty-three surviving manuscript poems the process is more complex, since only one poem in Herrick's hand survives. All the remaining manuscripts (nearly five hundred in all) are scribal copies, and in the many cases where more than one copy of a poem exists -- in one case there are fifty-nine copies -- it will be necessary to make transcriptions of all of them, and then to trace their relationship to each other in a way that leads back to the copy that is nearest to the lost original. This version will be taken as the copy text, and only emended where absolutely necessary, thus providing a corpus of poems whose texts approach as nearly as possible to what Herrick himself wrote. \n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-09-04</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>288210</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/D001382/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>470B20F0-5FD1-4AA6-8809-5E2780CBDB18</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Comparative Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
