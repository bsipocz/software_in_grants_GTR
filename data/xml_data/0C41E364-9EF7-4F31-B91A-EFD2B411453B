More specifically, the study focuses on the use of translation by various groups of well educated and committed Egyptians who have the language resources to provide an alternative interface with global audiences, one that projects a different account of the Revolution than can be found in mainstream sources and simultaneously questions hegemonic, patriarchal narratives circulating within Egyptian society, for example by video-recording the testimonies of women who have been active in the Revolution and disseminating them on the web to question male-centred accounts of the uprising. 

A cornerstone of the political activities of such groups is the circulation of written documents and audiovisual material that are originally produced in Arabic, to contest mainstream domestic narratives. These documents (press releases from activist groups, news not reported in mainstream sources, short documentary films) are then translated, primarily into English, in order to reach a wider global public and intervene in shaping narratives of the Revolution that circulate internationally. The study aims to offer a nuanced, empirical account of how these groups function, how they mobilise volunteer translators, how they see their relationship with global movements of justice, and what their modes of practice, including the selection of texts and audiovisual material to translate, might reveal about the extent to which they are embedded in the culture of global movements of collective action. In doing so, it sets out to demonstrate that translation is a key and pervasive mode of interaction that exercises significant influence on the way we come to understand the events unfolding around us at any moment in time. As a major tool of contestation, it is also increasingly used to connect activists across the world, and to demonstrate that local and global grievances cannot be addressed separately but must be negotiated and contested jointly across national and linguistic boundaries.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The main beneficiaries of this research fall into the following groups:

(a) Policy makers in government organisations, e.g. Commonwealth &amp;amp; Foreign Office, have an intrinsic interest in understanding how different groups of Egyptian activists work, how they connect with other activists worldwide, and what narratives of the Revolution they are invested in promoting.

(b) Think tanks and interest groups with an interest in political movements in the Arab World, including the Egyptian Revolution, e.g. Foreign Policy Centre, Chatham House and Arab Reform Initiative, will benefit from findings about progressive, grassroots initiatives that offer alternative models of citizen-led mobilisation and contestation of mainstream narratives.

(c) Independent news services such as Democracy Now and Indymedia, as well as networks of bloggers and citizen journalists, such as Global Voices Online, which focus on circulating reports from blogs and other sources of citizen media in order to give space to voices that are not ordinarily heard in international mainstream media. These will benefit from findings about local Egyptian groups with compatible agendas.

(d) Non-profit and charitable media trusts such as One World Media, which support global media communities that promote dialogue, democracy and fair government worldwide will be interested in the findings for similar reasons.

(e) The wider British and European public. Perhaps more than any other political movement in the region, the Egyptian Revolution has captured the imagination of the general public everywhere. The outputs of this research will reveal a novel aspect of the Revolution that is hardly covered in mainstream media and will give exposure to the groups under study and their contribution to elaborating a different set of narratives of the Egyptian uprising.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>140453</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Translating Dissent: Researching the Prefigurative Politics of Subtitling in the Egyptian Revolution (Manchester)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AD983176-CDD9-4977-BDC8-95778D9E57D1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Keynote at Symposium entitled 'Researching Translation in the Context of Popular Culture', attended by scholars (lecturers) and research students from wide range of institutions, and including a delegation from Cairo University.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56c6e1d3147b62.94681724</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://artisinitiative.org/events/events/manchester2015/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Hong Kong University 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>813191FF-D6E9-454A-BDB4-1635AAF1020B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>An invited seminar attended by Professors and students from various disciplines.

Keynotes and workshops were video recorded and are available on the conference site: see https://globalizingdissent.wordpress.com/resources-2/. The conference was billed as a huge success and provided a much needed platform for networking and political expression during a period that witnessed exceptional levels of repression in Egypt.

The workshop resulted in excellent debate beyond the event itself, and in one award winning film maker writing an essay on the issues discussed, and which she had not considered at all before the workshop. The workshop was video recorded and is available to a wide range of audiences on the web.

One award winning film maker has engaged extensively with the issues discussed in an extended essay due to be published early next year. Other film makers have been raising the issues concerned in interviews and in the mailing list of a prominent activist group in Egypt.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>543453286ca251.57642997</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.translationstudiesportal.org/ar/media/entry/subtitling_workshop</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>University of Padova, Italy: Subtitling the Revolution:  Challenging Gender Categories in Words of Women from the Egyptian Revolution</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D14F68AD-FF70-40F7-AB40-D65CA89980D6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Roundtable debate organised by the Next Generation Global Studies Research Group at the University of Padova, Italy (Department of Political Science, Law and International Studies).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56c8699b692ce5.06844934</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seminar at American University in Cairo on Subtitling in the Egyptian revolution</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>43773DC0-1C20-4F68-833C-42DA2E15882D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Approximately 15 postgraduate students and lecturers attended and debated some of the findings of my research on the political impact of subtitling choices in the context of the Egyptian revolution.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56c6e607d13840.43473310</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6NTBds1W50</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>?

Several of the film makers and subtitles in Mosireen and Words of Women from the Egyptian Revolution contributed to my edited collection, Translating Dissent, and used that space to think about the ethical and political implications of the decisions they made as film makers and translators and how they might engage with each other and the process of translation differently in future. The Globalising Dissent conference I organised in Cairo in March 2015, during a period of extreme repression and censorship, provided a much needed space for activists to reflect on the trauma of the past few years (see http://muftah.org/a-conference-in-cairo/#.VtOkJMcftSX) and was attended by cultural works, journalists, cartoonists, academics, and members of the general public, many of whom later wrote to say it was a transformative experience for them. I have many of these personal messages saved.</gtr:description><gtr:id>48C1309C-CC7C-4D67-9228-F0B15D97F6F8</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56d7be1f423540.24051976</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project has confirmed that translation, including subtitling, is an integral part of any political project, whether those involved in the project are aware of its impact or not. Subtitling practices either undercut the project by failing to reflect or partake of its goals and values, or enhance it by providing an additional space for actualizing these values and enacting them textually and visually. The values examined include solidarity, respect for diversity and pluralism, a commitment to non-hierarchical and non-representational modes of practice, and a willingness to experiment and innovate rather than accept dominant practices and values. Subtitlers involved with the collectives examined in this project are positioned by the filmmakers, and position themselves, outside the collective proper, rather than as an organic part of the political project. For the prefigurative potential of subtitling to be realized, both filmmakers and subtitlers need to renegotiate their position vis-&amp;agrave;-vis each other and the political project. As they do so, many factors will make the dialogue difficult: their physical separation across continents, given that volunteer subtitlers tend to be dispersed across cities, towns, countries and continents while film makers in place-based collectives such as those studied in this project tend to have regular face-to-face contact, at least while they're filming and editing; the persistent attitudes to translation that influence the way even political activists approach it, and the way subtitlers think of their role; the emotional burn out activists often experience, which leaves them little energy to reflect and act on yet another 'problem' that is understandably dwarfed by the momentous events they are trying to document; and the tremendous pressure and time restrictions under which both filmmakers and subtitlers work in the context of protracted protests and violent repression. Despite these challenges, the dialogue must be initiated and attitudes on both sides must be rethought if subtitling is to play a positive role in effecting the kind of global solidarity the world needs at this stage.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>By working more closely with different protest movements (in Spain, Turkey, Argentina, Hong Kong, etc) to describe the role of subtitling in mediating narratives of protest locally and globally and supporting or undercutting the values which seem to orient most protest movements today across the globe, and by engaging in dialogue with activists involved in this movement and the subtitlers (and translators) who mediate the documentary material they produce, in order to raise awareness among both groups of the impact of subtitling practices on the entire political project and the global movement for justice more broadly.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>18383AA7-14A3-4724-98C2-31D2C3BD43C8</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d7bc2f4513a7.28433578</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>65A4F1F0-6C46-423B-8045-1959834F3316</gtr:id><gtr:title>Translating Dissent: Voices from and with the Egyptian Revolution</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/549cbf805ce7d8520d8a40810c6b0188"><gtr:id>549cbf805ce7d8520d8a40810c6b0188</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Baker M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781138929876</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>56c6bafa4b96f4.01546926</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3EDAA7C9-E3E5-4A85-8C34-1E75090E360D</gtr:id><gtr:title>The prefigurative politics of translation in place-based movements of protest</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Translator</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/549cbf805ce7d8520d8a40810c6b0188"><gtr:id>549cbf805ce7d8520d8a40810c6b0188</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Baker M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a7352a674c1e3.51468750</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>432E917C-9347-4FAB-AC6B-10406B66FADA</gtr:id><gtr:title>The prefigurative politics of translation in place-based movements of protest: Subtitling in the Egyptian revolution</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Translator: Studies in Intercultural Communication</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/549cbf805ce7d8520d8a40810c6b0188"><gtr:id>549cbf805ce7d8520d8a40810c6b0188</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Baker M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56d7b84a7f9e55.75238359</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/K008242/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DB058E35-DBAD-4B21-B030-5C3C78825B11</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Area Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>062860E1-C81F-4028-9095-19A5E6455C70</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Languages &amp; Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8E63C4A9-31AC-4950-BF4C-643F945B707F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Asian &amp; Middle Eastern Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3E66DC80-F20F-4AC2-915A-AF46F5C6ED14</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Interpreting &amp; Translation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8CFBC166-7B26-4853-BEC7-A2087E737752</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Middle East Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5455CCD0-BA52-40F6-8DAE-1BA1063EE624</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
