&lt;p>Synchronicity arises when practitioner and patient focus on a single event, which breaks down habitual boundaries between them and generates space for negotiating uncertainty and interpersonal relations.

This ensues in a subsequent sense of general well-being. Chinese foot massage is procedure undertaken for pleasure at leisure, for health maintenance and for therapeutic reasons. It has gained popularity in contemporary China, particularly among the urban middle classes (massaged by the floating population from a rural background). The footage was shot in a massage parlour of Nanjing city, PR China, in autumn 2009. The micro-gestures were named by the masseur, who wrote them from memory onto a piece of paper in the ethnographer's presence, a sequence of over forty different gestures in total. The massage assembles techniques for treating Chinese medical body parts, Western biomedical body parts and the solar plexus as known from South Asian healing traditions and concludes with the application of an electronic device. The micro gestures were applied in much the sequence in which they are filmed. 

The film (camera: Elisabeth Hsu, editor: Paola Esposito) has no sound track. It presents the foot reflexology zones to which these techniques were applied based on research undertaken by Chun Liu and Wu Xiaojiao.</gtr:description><gtr:id>92C01749-764D-435D-9337-38E4319FB051</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The pen-ultimate version of the film was presented in the Green Templeton medical anthropology film and discussion group, in February 2016.

This workshop will focus on the techniques for managing time which specialists and their clients use to obtain desired resolutions to crisis situations. Whereas previous research has been concerned with classic meaning-centred analyses, including catharses that arise through religious symbolism or reinterpretations of the self in medical narratives, this conference will consider how specialists, their clients and even the techniques themselves mutually manipulate time. The workshop's main aim will be to explore what techniques do to people, rather than how people influence techniques.

There are a wide range of religious and medical techniques for managing time and crises. For instance, Mongolian divinatory practices sometimes yield innovations which escalate the timing at which the household's fortune rises. East Asian medical practitioners have also developed calendrical techniques to deliver treatment in specialised cycles, as well as bodily techniques involving touch such as massage or pulse diagnosis, to instigate moments of vitality-engendering 'synchronicity' between the practitioner and patient which may be conducive to health.

Through their impact on people and crises, techniques may acquire the same levels of agency that are held by other subjects (e.g. people, spirits or animals). Indeed, the triangular relation between specialists, clients and techniques gives rise to 'the viewpoint of the technique', which is a perspective unto itself and may only be detected by the more virtuosic specialists. The purview of the technique, then, affords numerous modes of agency within - and perspectives onto - any given crisis situation. In light of this, the workshop will compare how people in North, East and Southeast Asia look onto the world, and actively manipulate the timing of events, through the lens of the technique.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-1098486921.84173232ab07ca4</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:url>http://www.isca.ox.ac.uk/research/medical-and-ecological-anthropology/eastern-medicines-and-religions/argo-emr/seminars-and-events/workshop-the-viewpoint-of-the-technique/</gtr:url></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Facial tattooing among Drung women and the transition to womanhood</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:id>D4122131-D2FD-4D2A-9A1C-7FBF538BE1BD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>My presentation will focus on some aspects of female facial tattooing among Drung women in Yunnan (China) through their discourses and descriptions. I will discuss a (now obsolete) practice whereby, through a technique, the body and the person are both the subject and a means of transformation. Facial tattooing is essentially a transition to what is and ought to be a woman. Endowed with metamorphic power, tattooing makes things happen. Gender performativity is associated with the materiality of the body: it is in fact the tattoo that makes a woman. If the tattoo makes a woman, then she can play her role. It is indeed all about alliance, as if for a woman alliance is the basis of her humanity. Yet beyond the mere kin relationship, there are also specific relationships between women; relationships involving fertility which is exchanged, transmitted or, perhaps more accurately, &amp;quot;revealed&amp;quot; and represented by the tattooing. I intend to examine the transition established by the tattoo that is the mark of time and destiny. Female tattooing sustains, marks, or speeds up time which is the physiological time of the transition to nubility. This is critical to fully assign to a woman her destiny, her social role as a perpetuator of life.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-8961698486.4340152a8e95e4</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:url>http://Facial tattooing among Drung women and the transition to womanhood</gtr:url></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Generating synchronicity : an exploration into the efficacy of Chinese medicine</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:id>273ADBBE-771A-4993-8FAF-71A152B13D73</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was a presentation, attended by about 40-50 practitioners of acupuncture and herbal medicine at the conference: the British conference of acupuncture and Oriental medicine, hosted by the British Acupuncture council, 11(-12) Sept 2010.

Each qigong style has its own way of dealing with qigong malpractice, from administering acupuncture to the use of depressants. In addition to 'physical' remedies, Zhineng Qigong employs a set of 'heart-mind methods' in preventing and treating qigong deviation. As a 'scientific' form of qigong, Zhineng Qigong has integrated classical Chinese thought and modern science to produce a unique cosmology that provides resources for the various techniques used to manage encounters with - the most fundamental constituent of the cosmos. Despite its materiality, is also treated as an omnipresent and non-sentient form of , which when not properly handled by practitioners, leads to qigong deviation. This rather counter-intuitive conception of agency requires a critical re-assessment of the Cartesian epistemological assumptions that go with it. Drawing inspirations from Zhineng Qigong metaphysics and Anne Scott's fusion of actor-network theory and phenomenology, I argue that agency does not necessarily exist as conscious choices enacted through corporeality, but is located between and within the myriad components that constitute the cosmos, i.e. as . Even though Zhineng Qigong acknowledges the 'will-full' nature of , the art also strongly emphasizes the power of the human volition in influencing the courses of events. How then, do Zhineng Qigong practitioners manage the inevitable frictions that arise from the meeting of human and cosmic agents? Drawing parallels between qigong training techniques and Ingold's notion of 'enskilment', I seek to show how (qigong competency or power-skill) is acquired from, reflected in, shapes, and shaped by the 'doings' of everyday life. Qigong enskilment is thus not merely picking up a new skill within a bounded training ground, but a process of that involves the immersion of the self within a relationship with the cosmos. The focus of my talk will be on the various heart-mind methods, which when seen in the context described above, are not unlike techniques of diplomacy.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-7282877040.3590772a967b1a</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:url>http://rss.oucs.ox.ac.uk/oxitems/generatersstwo2.php?channel_name=socanth/anthropology-audio</gtr:url></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1B05F56F-4431-4CF2-AD6A-AC94A1B544D1</gtr:id><gtr:title>The
