I plan to write a book articulating and defending an account of ought-claims that is motivated by the idea that 'ought' adds expressive power to English of a specifically logical nature. I'll develop this by deploying semantic methods from the philosophy of language and linguistics while remaining sensitive to theoretical implications in ethics and epistemology. A brief summary follows.\n\nEthicists are interested in what is right and wrong, good and bad, and what one ought and ought not to do. Meta-ethicists seek to abstract away from these issues, in order to ask about the meaning and objective status of these claims. Epistemologists are interested in the nature of knowledge, justification, and evidence. And meta-epistemologists seek to abstract away from these issues, in order to ask meta-epistemological questions about the meaning and status of these claims. \n\nIt has become widely accepted that ethical claims are a species of something more general: normative claims. What this means is that, although we make claims about e.g. what one ought to do morally, we also make claims about what one ought to do prudentially, or as a parent, etc. Similarly, although we make claims about e.g. what one ought to believe in light of the evidence, we also make claims about what one ought to believe prudentially, or as a friend, etc. All of these claims differ in which norms are implicated, but they all seem to share in deploying norms. This suggests that questions about the meaning of ethical and epistemic claims might be best approached by situating them together within a broader question about normative claims in general.\n\nIn this project, I will begin to address the more general question by arguing for an account of ought-claims. These are not the only types of normative claims, but they are paradigmatic. And, since we can formulate many of the relevant ethical and epistemic claims with an 'ought', an account of ought-claims promises suitable generality.\n\nI begin with 'ought' instead of 'good', 'right', 'virtue' or 'reason' because 'ought' is recognized by linguists to be a modal auxiliary verb. Among other things, this means that 'ought' must always be combined with another verb to form a grammatical sentence, and it can often be viewed as an operator on a proposition. Also, there appears to be a rich system of modal verbs in all natural languages; in English, 'ought' is similar to 'must' and 'should' in often expressing compulsion or obligation, which contrasts with modals like 'may' and 'can' which often express ability or permission. Linguists try to articulate this system for particular languages and explore cross-linguistic comparisons; philosophers of language seek to prescind from particular languages and ask what a system of modals allows us to say that we couldn't say without them.\n\nThis interesting work in linguistics and the philosophy of language has been mostly ignored by meta-ethicists and meta-epistemologists. It is a key aim of my research to rectify that oversight. I will achieve this by deploying a general system for the modals to articulate an account of 'ought', which is intended to be neutral across ethical and epistemic deployment. \n\nWhile that will be of independent interest to ethicists, epistemologists, philosophers of language, and semanticists, I also think it lays the groundwork for bringing more precision to the meta-ethical debate about the meaning of normative claims. Realists think the expressive role of normative claims is to help us to describe aspects of reality that we could not otherwise describe, while Expressivists think their expressive role comes in their expressing attitudes that we could not otherwise express. By viewing 'ought's modal operators and developing an inferential-role view them, I hope to defend a new view that moves beyond this traditional debate.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The increasingly pluralistic and secular nature of contemporary society often seems to encourage a sort of scepticism - not only about ethical rules but also about the possibility of objective knowledge of the natural world. Academic philosophers and philosophically astute laypeople are often tempted to look for an answer to such scepticism by appealing to some supposed aspect of reality (e.g. God, natural selection, human nature, overall utility, brute facts) or by insisting that ethical and epistemic claims aren't in the business of stating facts but expressing subjective attitudes. This research pursues a different tack, and will thereby increase understanding of the way rules or norms are codified in our language, regulating both our interactions with one another (ethics) and our pursuits of further knowledge of the natural and social worlds (epistemology). This will lay the foundation for a new way of responding to the challenges of ethical and epistemological scepticism in popular culture.\n\nIt does so in three ways (see my Impact Plan for more on each of these). \n\nFirst, it locates issues about the meaning of the word 'ought' within issues about linguistic rules, where linguistic rules are conceived of as mind-dependent, in one sense, but potentially objective, in another. In my view, ethical and epistemic norms are our norms, but in order to be so they - like linguistic rules - have to stretch beyond particular people or groups in setting up standards of correctness. \n\nSecond, by finding a place for epistemic norms in the social sphere, this research develops conceptual foundations for understanding the process and value of knowledge-transfer and knowledge-exchange. What we ought to believe is in my view determined in part by what is likely true but also by social aspects of the regulation of human beliefs in community. This transpires in light of epistemological and practical norms at the foundation of knowledge-transfer and knowledge-exchange.\n\nThird, given the way I seek to account for claims about what one ethically ought to do and what one epistemically ought to believe within one semantic framework (see case for support), the research also lays conceptual foundation for thinking about the interactions and potential trade-offs between ethical and epistemic rules in policy making. For instance, many public policy decisions (e.g. reactions to climate science, preparations for flu pandemics, military planning in light of intelligence) seem to manifest a complicated interaction between what we ought to believe and what we ought to do in light of what we believe. \n\nPhilosophers will benefit from this research by reading the book and articles in which it is published and building on it in further research into the nature of normativity and the semantics of other normative words and/or in incorporating the insights into their own understandings of humanity and human language. Like most good philosophy, the broader impact is meant to come mostly over the long term in how it affects the ways people such as public intellectuals, politicians, journalists, religious clergy, teachers, novelists etc. think and communicate with the public at large about living together in the natural and social world we find around us. This sort of impact is difficult to specify or predict precisely, but its reality and significance is born out in the history of philosophy. Nonetheless, I want my research to reach a wider audience in the short term as well. So, in addition to the primary academic outputs of this research, I will also write a piece for the popular journal Think (Royal Institute of Philosophy focused on bringing philosophy to a very wide audience) on the problems arising from ethical and epistemological scepticism as well as apparent competition between ethical and epistemic 'ought's.

Ethical theorists are interested in the meaning of this word because general ethical principles and particular ethical conclusions can often be stated with an ought-claim. For example, Utilitarianism can be put as the view that one ought always act so as to maximize overall happiness. And the extreme pro-life position in the abortion debate can be put as the view that one ought never to have an abortion.

However, the word 'ought' is also interesting from a linguistic point of view. This is because it is not a normal verb but a modal verb. Moreover, along with other modal verbs like 'must' and 'may' it exhibits a variety of flavours besides the moral flavor. For example, we can say 'To get to Harlem, you ought to take the A train' which is narrowly instrumental. We can also say, 'You ought to com 'round for dinner sometime' which expresses a speaker's desire or wish. And even more remarkably we say things like 'They left an hour ago, so they ought to be home by now,' which seem to have to do with probabilities and evidence rather than actions in accordance with a rule.

This project seeks an account of the meaning of 'ought' that is sensitive to both sources of interest in this word.

?'Ought' is not homologous across deontic and epistemic uses.
?We should strive to give a semantic account of 'ought' that is unified across deontic and epistemic uses and systematic within a structure of modal terms.
?Semantically, 'ought' is best viewed as a modal operator.
?Realist and expressivist meta-semantic accounts are unsatisfactory when combined with our best linguistic understanding of the semantic properties of 'ought'.
?Inferentialist meta-semantic accounts offer a more attractive home for our best linguistic understanding of the semantic properties of 'ought' and the foundations of a unified and systematic philosophical understanding of the meaning of 'ought'.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The results of this research have already been uptaken in the research of other
