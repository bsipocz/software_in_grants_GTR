However hydraulic systems are inherently very noisy and new techniques for fluid-borne noise (FBN) attenuation are needed to achieve acceptable and safe noise levels as documented in The Health and Safety Executive 'The Control of Noise at Work Regulations 2005'. It is obvious that low-noise hydraulic machines can significantly improve people's working environment and quality of life.

Hydraulic systems are often inefficient with an average efficiency of 21%. An average 5% improvement in efficiency can save 0.51 quadrillion Btu of energy and US$10.1 billion while reducing carbon dioxide emissions by more than 33.95 million metric tons, according to the recent study of 'Estimating the Impact (Energy, Emission and Economics) of the US Fluid Power Industry, 2011'. Some new techniques such as 'digital' fluid power promise much lower energy losses but are hampered by higher noise levels according to the findings from the recently completed research project (EPSRC grant EP/H024190/1). Effective noise control techniques should enable use of these more efficient hydraulic systems, resulting in considerable reduction in fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions.

The noise in hydraulic circuits presents itself as FBN, structure borne noise and air borne noise. FBN is caused by the unsteady flow produced by pumps and motors or 'digital' hydraulics, and propagates through the system causing vibration or structure borne noise, which in turn causes air borne noise. Traditional noise control measures can lead to additional power losses. Unwanted noise also consumes energy and generates heat which may lead to machines instability and failures. In response to the engineering challenges in noise control and energy efficiency, this proposal is a timely investigation into a novel integrated noise attenuation system for hydraulic machines. The proposed research would be a world first, and will apply a newly integrated noise control approach engaging both active and passive control methods to obtain an effective, robust and high-bandwidth noise attenuation for fluid power systems. Uniquely, this new approach allows the dominant harmonic pressure pulsations to be attenuated by the active attenuator and high frequency noise to be cancelled by passive tuned flexible hoses without impairing the system dynamic response. This novel methodology can significantly improve the noise attenuation performance. Simulations of a generic integrated FBN control system studied by the PI show that 55dB attenuation was achieved, while 40dB was achieved by only using the active control method and 20dB was achieved by using the passive control approach, respectively.

The research outcomes will deliver effective solutions to replace traditional noise control equipment and provide input into the development of quieter fluid power machines in the UK and worldwide. The experimental results will provide confidence in applying the integrated FBN control system and design methodology for both conventional and 'digital' hydraulic machines. This research will maintain my research group's unique world leading position and accelerate research impact to ensure the UK remains internationally competitive. This work will ensure the UK's significant role in the global market for hydraulic components which is projected to reach US$67.8 billion by 2020 and further enhance the UK's leading position in the European hydraulic market. It will also help ensure that the UK is well equipped to deal with noise challenges in hydraulic engineering and has the research capability and quantitative skills for worldwide environmental and energy challenges it may face in the future.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The global market for hydraulic components is projected to reach US$67.8 billion by 2020, driven by rising demand for energy efficient hydraulic equipment, according to the 'Global Strategic Business Report of Hydraulic Components' in 2015. A direct and immediate beneficiary is the hydraulic system and component industry, which is worth approximately &amp;pound;1 billion to the UK economy, and growing at 10% a year according to the latest available figures from CETOP, the European trade organisation. These systems and components are used in a diverse range of machines and industries including automotive, aerospace, construction, marine and defence, and so the customer base is immense. The research outcomes will enable these developers and manufacturers to produce quieter and more efficient machines, as well as leading to other design improvements such as compact power supplies, intelligent hydraulic components and efficient fluid power system designs. Therefore, these hydraulic components and systems will be more efficient and competitive, which ensures the UK remaining internationally competitive in the global hydraulic market.

It is expected that the design concepts of prototypes for the integrated fluid-borne noise attenuation system will be the most immediately exploitable elements of the research. The design concepts are likely to be exploitable by the University through patents which are expected to attract interest from fluid power system and component industries. The active controller design code will be freely available as open source and the methodology will be shared with industry and academia. This will accelerate the research impact and facilitate the commercialisation of the research outcomes. The research outcomes are also likely to be transferred into real business projects through the Knowledge Transfer Partnerships or to be formed into a new spin-out company which will focus on providing noise attenuation solutions to machine manufactures and end-users in he UK. UK-based companies will receive a competitive advantage in exploiting the novel noise control approaches for hydraulic systems delivered from the research and also in significantly influencing the application potential of digital hydraulic systems in the market. These business related activities can shorten the time between knowledge discovery and use of knowledge and contribute to wealth creation. 

The low-noise hydraulic machines can also significantly improve people's working environment and enhance their quality of life. In the longer term, reducing noise generated by hydraulic machines can also contribute to the UK Government's commitment to cutting carbon dioxide emissions, using energy efficiency and building green environment. According to the recent Energy Technology Institute, nearly 10% of all ground-based vehicle emissions in the UK are from the off-road sector. This mainly constitutes vehicles for construction and agriculture which generally rely on hydraulic transmission and actuation, and to which this research will be directly applicable. Reducing noise enables more economic and sustainable development of fluid power machines and benefits stakeholders including the resident and local councils with machine noise concerns. 

The challenging project goals are related to the fundamental understanding and development of a new integrated noise control approach to attenuate fluid-borne noise generated in hydraulic systems, combined with the training of a PhD student in state-of-the-art simulation techniques and experimental methods, and the establishment of my research group with the capabilities to research in noise control, machine dynamics analysis and control and machine energy efficiency. Particularly as a result of working with industrial collaborators, the postgraduate researchers (PhD and MSc) will develop technical and transferrable skills which are valuable for both continued employment in academia as well as in industry.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>101051</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BB22CBB9-343C-4B9C-978D-EECC23C26987</gtr:id><gtr:title>Novel three-piston pump design for a slipper test rig</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Applied Mathematical Modelling</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/6f5ff2310b21823fdc45326aba6a7d2d"><gtr:id>6f5ff2310b21823fdc45326aba6a7d2d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Zhang J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a6c541ca58837.56607799</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>BD218729-0D82-498C-BFD8-921CD0F0F154</gtr:id><gtr:title>Adaptive Control of a Piezoelectric Valve for Fluid-Borne Noise Reduction in a Hydraulic Buck Converter</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Dynamic Systems, Measurement, and Control</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/68d894131f9887c2a2cdcee62d216d63"><gtr:id>68d894131f9887c2a2cdcee62d216d63</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pan M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a6c541d065bd4.39565730</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D085358B-755F-405E-99D1-95E1DC511E7C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Experimental study on the influence of the rotating cylinder and circling pistons on churning losses in axial piston pumps</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Energies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/05229ec2e31a417a7d6b9ca9c67afd11"><gtr:id>05229ec2e31a417a7d6b9ca9c67afd11</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Junhui Zhang</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a6c541d24db22.05499331</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P022022/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>99E0B904-CAB5-4511-AFB3-AA6D2B171F97</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Process engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>53CC8ACD-11A0-48ED-8743-F66E9A657C12</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Fluid Dynamics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
