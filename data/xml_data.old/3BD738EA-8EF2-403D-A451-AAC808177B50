Co-production involves mental health service users being able to make decisions about their own treatment and care as equal partners alongside professionals. This application is timely because there is currently a strong policy emphasis encouraging the greater involvement of service users and carers in making decisions about the care they receive. It is widely recognised that new ways of working with service users (a new approach to professionalism) are needed in mental health care. 
This seminar series was developed jointly by a research team which includes service users, carers, and people working in charitable/voluntary organisations, and in public and governmental organisations. Academics in the research team are from diverse disciplinary backgrounds: mental health nursing, philosophy, political science, psychiatry, social work and sociology. 
The seminar series will bring people together from different stakeholder groups in order to develop ideas about new ways of working in mental health which are based on the principle of co-production. This will involve considering current practices, policies, approaches in different organisations, as well as education and training in mental health. Crucially, mental health service users and their family carers will fully participate in this process. We use the term 'professional' in a new way. A professional can (for us) belong to any occupational group. What makes someone professional is, in our view, their sense of commitment - not their occupational status. Importantly, we believe that service users and family carers should be considered professionals in this context because they are 'experts in experience'. Our speakers and participants include some people who are in positions where they can shape practice, education and policy. We believe though that it is important that all the participants have equal status. The idea is that sharing ideas across groups will be enable us to work out how professionalism in mental health can be based on co-production. 
In healthcare a growing importance is being placed on respecting different people's values. This is known as Values Based Practice (VBP). But the problem is that VBP overlooks problems of power - that is the reality that some people's values and perspectives are more powerful and influential than other people's. This is why this seminar series will encourage people to think about co-production by considering some of the key ideas associated with 'democratic professionalism' (DP). DP is based on the idea that it is important that the voices of 'lay' people, particularly marginalised people, should be regarded as highly relevant when it comes to shaping professional practice and values. Another principle of DP is that professionals should be assessed according to the extent to which they support the involvement and enablement of people they work with, such as service users. In other words, professionalism should involve sharing power with others, not exercising power over them. We believe that our seminar series will contribute to the development of professional practice and values which are suited to the 21st century. 
Each seminar will focus on a particular topic: the first two seminars set the scene with a focus on co-production and democratic professionalism and on people's lived experience of co-production. The seminars which follow consider how changes to practice, policy and education in mental health could be implemented to develop a new form of professionalism based on co-production.
We will make the video-recordings of the seminar series available on our website and we will have a blog to continue the discussions and conversations which take place in the seminars. All the groups represented at the seminars will contribute to future practical and research initiatives.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The beneficiaries include mental health service users, informal carers, people who work in the field of mental health (employed by third sector organisations and by public services), as well as educators, policy makers, and commissioners. Our seminar series will interrogate the concept of co-production from diverse perspectives in order to develop an understanding which can inform changes to practice, policy, commissioning and education in mental health which will support new forms of professionalism based on power-sharing. The seminar series format is based on an enactment of democratic professionalism, thereby bridging service user, practitioner, academic cultures, and policy and statutory boundaries for the purpose of knowledge transfer which benefits all stakeholder groups. This will support more creative and integrated ways of working across public services and third sector organisations whilst placing the values of service users at the centre. This is important in the contemporary context in which local authorities are tasked with implementing mental health strategies by enabling collaborations between third sector and public services. Through their participation in the seminar series the beneficiaries will gain from the guidance of one of our project partners COLLABORATE, a social enterprise which has a well established reputation for providing practical support on developing outcomes-focused collaborations across multiple stakeholders in civil society, academia government and business (see pathways to impact). 
The capacity of the seminar series to impact on practices, policy and education will be significantly facilitated by project partners and collaborators, which include high profile organisations and individuals. Through our partnership with the Centre for Values Based Practice at St. Catherine's College, University of Oxford, we will have direct access to the Chief Executives of national organisations such as the Professionals Standards Authority (through its Chief Executive, Harry Cayton) and NICE (through its Chief Executive, Sir Andrew Dillon), and to other senior figures in health and social care such as Lord Adebowale (a presenter at the seminar series). Our NHS project partners (Leeds and York Foundation Partnership Trust, the South West Yorkshire Partnership Trust, and the Yorkshire and Humberside Leadership Academy) will enable us to reach multiple stakeholders.
Our seminar series will benefit academics in diverse fields: mental health nursing, philosophy, psychiatry, political science, social work, and sociology. Academics will engage in interdisciplinary discussions which are novel in that they apply a political perspective to the area of co-production in mental health, which has previously been limited to academic endeavour in health and nursing. The seminar series will benefit academics through the development of democratic professionalism across a wider range of disciplines, and equally by embedding democratic professionalism into UK scholarship. Research and scholarship arising from the seminar series will be disseminated in high quality publications, for instance, Philosophy, Psychiatry &amp;amp; Psychology, the British Journal of Social Work, Social Science and Medicine, Sociology of Health and Illness, and the International Journal of Mental Health Nursing. Speakers and participants include well established academics and early career researchers (ECRs) who will learn much from each other as well as from other stakeholder groups. 
Our seminar series will have a societal impact by influencing public policies and professional practices at regional, national and international levels. It will improve the effectiveness of mental health services and will contribute to social justice, particularly for mental health service users who are amongst the most marginalised members of society. Finally, the seminar series will influence the shaping professionalism in the field of mental health.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-11-04</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-09-05</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>12557</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>A8F197B5-8FC9-4236-B48E-054040AB88CD</gtr:id><gtr:title>Co-production: what is it and where do we begin?</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of psychiatric and mental health nursing</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/d0734bae2b584cf5496ca8bdb20947a0"><gtr:id>d0734bae2b584cf5496ca8bdb20947a0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Fisher P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1351-0126</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58c126b2681588.57276338</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N008146/2</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:parents><gtr:parent><gtr:id>D477AB64-AA82-44A9-A941-CB1C31F89FCA</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>ES/N008146/1</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>28476.76</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2015-11-02</gtr:start><gtr:end>2016-09-04</gtr:end><gtr:children><gtr:child rel="Transfer"><gtr:id>3BD738EA-8EF2-403D-A451-AAC808177B50</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>ES/N008146/2</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>12557.99</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2016-09-05</gtr:start><gtr:end>2017-11-04</gtr:end><gtr:children/></gtr:child></gtr:children></gtr:parent></gtr:parents></gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6723A70B-A523-40AB-9740-B6AD2A0677B7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medical &amp; health interface</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>ACFABADE-E54A-4FC7-B9F5-259A19D97CDB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Work</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5BECA85F-CCD1-43D9-9B33-FFDFF6377498</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Med Soc/Soc Health &amp; Illness</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3C193D18-12BD-4B15-8347-037BA623E0FF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mental Health</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F7EEE6CD-E283-4BAB-BA5E-70B4B0F1F1A6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5455CCD0-BA52-40F6-8DAE-1BA1063EE624</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACFABADE-E54A-4FC7-B9F5-259A19D97CDB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Work</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
