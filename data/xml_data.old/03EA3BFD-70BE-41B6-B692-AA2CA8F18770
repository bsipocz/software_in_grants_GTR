reading (Short title: Promoting language development via shared reading)</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/M003752/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The most cost-effective way to tackle the root causes of many social and educational problems is to intervene early in children's lives, before the problems have had a chance to entrench. Key to this strategy is improving children's language development in the early years. Children who enter school with good language skills have better chances in school, better chances of entering higher education, and better economic success in adulthood. 
Reading is very effective at boosting children's language. Children who read regularly with their parents or carers tend to learn language faster, enter school with a larger vocabulary of words and become more successful readers in school. Because of this, local authorities often commission services to promote family-based shared book reading (e.g. the Bookstart programme). 
However, recent studies suggest that shared book reading interventions work less effectively for children from disadvantaged backgrounds than originally thought, particularly when their parents have lower levels of education. This means that there is a danger that the benefits of shared reading will be restricted to children from more affluent homes and not get through to those who need them most. 
To solve this problem, we need to develop a better understanding of how reading interventions work, and of how parents use them. We need to identify what parents do and say when reading aloud with their children and why this makes reading so effective at boosting children's language. We need to find out whether differences in how parents read mean that parents from disadvantaged backgrounds use these language boosting behaviours less frequently. We need to determine how to design interventions that increase the use of these behaviours in all parents, especially those with lower levels of education. Then, once we have identified how reading interventions work, we need to determine how to help parents use them successfully in their daily lives. 
The aim of this project is to determine how shared reading promotes child language development, and use this knowledge to make it an effective language boosting tool for children from all social and economic backgrounds. In Work Package 1, we will identify what language boosting behaviours parents use in shared reading, and will determine how parents from different social/economic backgrounds use these behaviours during shared reading. In Work Package 2, we will create four targeted interventions, each focussed on a particular language boosting behavior, and investigate how they are implemented by parents from different backgrounds, and how they affect children's language development. In Work Package 3, we will explore what influences parents' decisions to read or not to read with their children, in order to work out why parents may be unwilling to read with their children and to identify how to make reading a more enjoyable experience. We will also evaluate the benefits of a new intervention, designed by national charity The Reader Organisation, to promote reading for pleasure. 
Across the project, we will study a range of language skills, covering the core language abilities that are essential for learning to read and write in school. We will produce one review article, 9 original research articles, 30 conference presentations, and activities for non-academic audiences at local and national level. We will also submit a Cochrane review on the effectiveness of shared reading interventions for language development. Our results will enable health professionals such as health visitors, early years educators such as nursery school teachers, and policy-makers in local and national government to design targeted, cost-effective interventions to improve the language of children between the ages of 0 and 5 years. The work addresses ESRC's strategic priorities Influencing Behaviour &amp;amp; Informing Interventions and A Vibrant &amp;amp; Fair Society.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We will provide:

a. Empirical evidence about which language boosting behaviours parents use in shared reading.
b. Evidence-based advice about how to design shared reading interventions for children of different ages, different socio-economic status, and with and without identified speech, language and communication needs (SLCN).
c. Evidence-based information about what barriers prevent some parents from reading with their children.
d. Detailed evaluation of a shared reading intervention designed to promote reading for pleasure.

These will benefit:

1. Children &amp;amp; parents. Parents play a crucial role in their child's development, but are often unaware of the value of reading with their children or report that they do not know how to interact with them (Bercow, 2008). Our results, disseminated directly to parents, will provide easy-to-follow guidance about how to read with children to boost language development. 

2. 3rd sector groups that promote language and literacy, with the ultimate aim of improving literacy in the UK. We will provide the evidence-base they need for their work. For example, our data on why shared reading promotes language will inform the work of ICAN and The Communication Trust's Communication Ambassadors; a network of 400 volunteers who work with 8,000 families in the most disadvantaged areas of England, sharing information about how parents can best help their children learn language. 

3. The Reader Organisation, which will receive information about how to create an effective Get Into Reading (GIR) programme for families with preschool children.

4. Practitioners in early years education (e.g. Early Years Foundation Stage, Children's Centres). The UK government has extended free childcare places to 2-year-olds, recognising the critical importance of high quality early years education. Yet educators report that providing language-rich environments in busy early years settings is a challenge. We will provide concrete advice about how to create effective shared reading programmes and how to harness parental involvement to maximise the environment for language learning.

5. Practitioners in healthcare (e.g. health visitors, speech &amp;amp; language therapists, family nurse partnerships). Shared reading interventions for children with speech, language and communication needs (SLCN) have the potential to be effective language boosting tools. However, how best to utilise them for children with low levels of language or with diagnosed language delay is as yet unclear. We will provide concrete advice about the effectiveness of these interventions with a) children at different ages, b) children from different socio-economic backgrounds, and c) children with identified SLCN. 

6. Policy-makers and commissioners tasked with improving the life-chances of UK children (e.g. Local Authorities, Public Health England). The preschool years are increasingly recognised as being crucial in determining a child's later life-chances, with early interventions yielding substantial savings to the UK's economy (Grint &amp;amp; Holt, 2011:&amp;pound;40 million invested in early parenting interventions could save &amp;pound;400 million over a 15 year period). However, commissioners and policy-makers need a sound evidence-base that they can use to design and evaluate cost-effective early interventions (e.g. What Works databases). We will provide the evidence needed to a) design and evaluate shared reading interventions to promote language growth, b) design effective interventions to remove the barriers to shared reading that face many parents.

In this way, our work will directly address UKRC's typology of research impacts:
a) increasing the effectiveness of public services and policy (short, medium and long term).
b) enhancing educational achievement, and thus quality of life, of UK children (medium and long term).
c) fostering the economic competitiveness of the United Kingdom (long term).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-08-03</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1167083</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Interview for Mother and Baby Magazine - Rowland</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F21AC8E4-CC00-48F5-B0B8-420856002FA1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Contributed information for a Mother &amp;amp; Baby magazine and is about how speech develops in babies and young children.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58aaff66dab580.26267550</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Improving Literacy: Understanding Reading Development and Reading Difficulties across the Lifespan (China)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6578ABAA-2E72-4372-957A-CDEC8697BB78</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Jamie attended a workshop for young academics interested in researching reading development.

One was a greater understanding of how families interacted with books in the home, the extent to which they used library services, and the age at which parents started reading with their children. Talking to parents about their family lives gave important initial insights into some of the difficulties they may experience in relation to sharing books with children, for example their perception of their child's level of interest in reading. 

The second result was to find out more about the views of practitioners working within the library services, particular their perceptions of the barriers to reading within more disadvantaged areas of the city and how these barriers may be overcome.

This outreach event stimulated our thinking about some of the barriers to reading that families may experience and also the important role of parental beliefs about the value of reading. As a result of conversations with practitioners we thought about the possible role of children's gender in shared reading practices, adding a question to the interview schedule to focus on parental beliefs about gender and children's interests.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>567aa15eca9fb9.11204820</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Participants in your research and patient groups</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited talk at The National Literacy Trust's Talk To Your Baby Conference 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>42FBB3D3-92F1-492B-A10E-B01710323692</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presented a 20 minute talk on the relationship between shared book reading and language development.

These groups provided an opportunity to informally talk to parents while they were playing with their children in a relaxed environment. Lots of the parents had not been involved in research projects before, so this was a chance to talk to them about what their involvement would mean and to reach people who may not otherwise have become involved. Some groups were attended multiple times, offering an opportunity to build up rapport with parents, and for those who had become 'formal' participants in the study to encourage friends to think about being interviewed for the research. The conversations with parents ranged around many different areas and sought to get a picture of their everyday family life, before talking more specifically about the research project. These conversations resulted in participants coming into the study who may not otherwise have responded to publicity material. We were also able to reach parents whose children did not attend a nursery setting and to understand their home life in-depth.

Most of the parents with whom one-on-one conversations were held, and who had a child of the right age to enable them to participate in the study, agreed to participate and be interviewed. Only two potential participants at this first stage were were not interested in participating. Therefore, this was an effective way of engaging with potential participants and encouraging people to get involved in the next stage of the research. Engaging with families face-to-face may also have encouraged participation from groups that have particularly been seen as 'harder to reach', for example those from BME communities and those on a low income. Many participants had not been involved in research before, and meeting people in the communities in which they lived was a way to break down barriers and explain informally what being involved in 'research' would mean in practice.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>567a9bd917f079.94371031</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Participants in your research and patient groups</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Teaching seminar, discussing the influence of family and home environment in the development of reading practices</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>94EE195B-FDF3-46C3-9677-4FAB38FDD190</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This teaching seminar was given as part of a residential weekend for the EdD at the University of Sheffield.

Practitioners were engaged in the research topic, seeing it as an important area of research and discussing how to change home practices in a positive way. There was particular discussion about how programmes to support parents may help parents build relationships and connections with each other, and how these 'unintended impacts' can be effectively captured by practitioners. Presenting some of the early analysis gives the audience an opportunity to stimulate our thinking as we continue with analysis and the next phase of research. For example, one area that we will consider is intergenerational reading practices such as those between grandparents and grandchildren.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>567aa9cbe5b4c9.37589501</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>200000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>Unknown</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>The People's Postcode Lottery Dream Fund</gtr:description><gtr:end>2019-04-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>People's Postcode Lottery</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>1DACCDF0-80EE-41FC-B289-577AA1C79E05</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58bedc5ac76142.46741583</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-04-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>1000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Travel award to attend a workshop entitled 'Improving Literacy: Understanding Reading Development and Reading Difficulties across the Lifespan' Tianjin Normal University, Tianjin, China, 21-23 September, 2016</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Newton Fund</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>23D12F9A-7467-45E9-903C-C708BC117455</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5898964cb128d9.42643075</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-09-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>2160</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>International Centre for Language and Communicative Development study visit grant</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-06-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>International Centre for Language and Communicative Development</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>1A2A48A8-05EF-4EAB-A8A8-2915ECB36C22</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58ab1f4faf57f2.68792828</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-05-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Drafts of our systematic review have been turned into talks for a number of stakeholder groups (parents and early years education practitioners) and an evidence briefing for a national charity.
