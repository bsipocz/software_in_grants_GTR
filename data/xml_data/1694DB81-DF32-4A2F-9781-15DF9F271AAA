This includes overseeing the portfolio of existing studies, considering new research questions, developing proposals and securing funding from NCRI members. The study groups are funded by the major cancer charities and by the MRC and are UK wide in their remit. The Groups are multi-disciplinary, with surgery, medical oncology, clinical oncology, radiology, pathology, epidemiology, statistics and other professions involved in clinical trials represented on each Group as appropriate. A list of the Groups is given on at http://www.ncrn.org.uk/Csg/index.htm Each Group meets at least two times per year and a number of the Groups have Sub-Groups and/or Working Parties that meet in the intervals between the main Group meetings. Some of the Groups host National Clinical Trials meetings of between 100 and 450 delegates. Each Group Chairman is responsible to the NCRN Operational Steering Group (OSG) for:The portfolio of trials developed or adopted by the Group - Contributing to studies developed or adopted by the Group - Monitoring the progress of the Group - Receiving input from the NCRN Co-ordinating Centre - Liason with other National and International trials organisations - Proposing membership of the Group in consultation with the NCRN Steering Group - Reporting to the NCRN Steering Group annually and through the triennial peer review mechanism - Providing advice to the NCRN Steering Group or NCRI, attending meetings as needed - Promoting good clinical research practice. A key aim of the NCRI partners was to double the numbers of patients being entered into cancer clinical trials in England within a three year period, this has already been achieved. The Government has provided the infrastructure to underpin phase III clinical trials through a National Cancer Research Network (NCRN). The Secretariat of the NCRI Clinical Studies Group is responsible for the overall day-to-day management and support of the Study Groups and is led by Dr Eileen Loucaides.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2005-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>761562</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MC_qA137857</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>7C58A707-1BF6-4573-A44F-30B271C80813</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cancer</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>A056411B-DD7A-4062-BE33-7849FBC9BFA7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>5.9  Resources and infrastructure (development of treatments)</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>208C592B-C1B7-4E87-A19A-04E8D9458E50</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>6.9  Resources and infrastructure (evaluation of treatments)</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>61645070-5FD7-4854-9441-A8EB3A8B21BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>7.4  Resources and infrastructure (disease management)</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
