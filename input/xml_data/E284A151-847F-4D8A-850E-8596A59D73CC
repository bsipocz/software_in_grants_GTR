It develops in 30% of people with the skin condition psoriasis and is the second commonest cause of inflammatory arthritis. In psoriatic arthritis the immune cells in the skin and the joints are over-active leading to inflammation and damage. Currently it is not known what initiates or drives this inflammation or if the mechanisms underlying inflammation in the skin and the joints are the same.

The aim of this project is to compare the immune cells causing inflammation in the skin with those causing inflammation in the joints. Immune cells express a specific receptor that allows them to recognise and bind to proteins that are recognised as &amp;quot;non-self&amp;quot;. When the receptor binds to such a protein the immune cell becomes activated and produces a variety of products (&amp;quot;cytokines&amp;quot;) that cause inflammation. The immune cell also starts to divide to produce multiple cells all expressing the same receptor. We predict that in psoriatic arthritis the immune cells causing inflammation in the skin express the same receptors and make the same cytokines as those in the joints. To investigate this we shall ask patients with psoriatic arthritis to donate blood samples and samples of inflamed skin and tissue lining inflamed joints. We shall isolate the immune cells of interest from these samples and analyse each cell individually to identify the receptor it expresses and the cytokines that it makes. We expect to find groups of immune cells expressing the same receptors to be present at the sites of inflammation i.e. the inflamed skin and inflamed joints but not the blood. We also expect to find that these groups of immune cells will express the same cytokines in both the skin and the joints.

This study will improve our knowledge of the cells causing inflammation in the skin and the joint in psoriatic arthritis and the cytokines they produce. This may lead to the identification of new targets (for example novel anti-cytokine strategies) for treatment. Furthermore, knowledge of which receptors are over-activated in inflamed tissue could lead to further studies to identify the protein(s) that activate these receptors. This in turn could lead to the development of treatments known as peptide immunotherapy to prevent the activation of these specific receptors and decrease or prevent the inflammation. This would represent an exciting new treatment option for psoriatic arthritis.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is an inflammatory arthritis that affects 0.3-1% UK population and occurs in 10-30% of people with psoriasis. We hypothesise that PsA is an antigen-driven IL-17+CD8+ T cell-mediated disease and that skin and joint inflammation is linked in terms of CD8+ T cell clonality and phenotype. Few studies have directly compared immune mechanisms in the skin and the joint in PsA and no study has simultaneously compared the clonality and phenotype of T cells from the skin and the joint. Our aims are (1) to isolate mononuclear cells from paired biopsies of inflamed skin, synovial tissue and blood from patients with PsA and quantify %IL-17+CD8+ T-cells by flow-cytometry. We expect to find increased %IL-17+CD8+ T-cells at sites of inflammation compared to blood and corresponding samples from controls with osteoarthritis. (2) To perform single cell analysis of paired alpha and beta T cell receptor sequences and single cell qPCR expression of 48 genes on CD8+ T cells from inflamed skin and synovial tissue and blood from patients with PsA (n=400 cells/site, n=2 patients). We expect to find (i) clonal expansion of CD8+ T cells in inflamed tissue but not blood. (ii) Skin and synovial tissue will harbour CD8+ T cells of the same clonality. (iii) Clonally expanded CD8+ T cells will share common phenotypes with higher %clonally expanded cells expressing IL-17 compared to non-clonally expanded cells. This project will link information regarding potential antigen-specificity and T-cell ancestry with phenotype. This could identify new therapeutic targets and provide a basis for future studies to identify responsible antigens with the possibility of developing peptide-immunotherapy.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>As described under &amp;quot;academic beneficiaries&amp;quot;, we believe this project will develop methods and generate results that will be of interest to researchers across a range of disciplines. With regards impact outside of academia, we anticipate that this project has the potential to benefit and impact on King's College London, industry, clinicians, clinical guideline committees and patients. This project will also have a positive impact on my personal development and career.

1. King's College London (King's)
King's is committed to developing technologies in single cell analysis. The state-of-the-art MRC-BRC funded single cell facility is now up and running. The use of single cell analysis techniques to compare T cells isolated from skin and synovial tissue in psoriatic arthritis was identified in the MRC grant as a lead priority area for exploration with this new platform. By undertaking this project we will be driving and participating in the development and application of single cell techniques at King's within this priority area. Thus this project will contribute to King's reputation as a centre of excellence for single cell analysis and to its scientific competitiveness.

2. Industry, clinicians, clinical guideline committees and patients
Current treatments for psoriatic arthritis comprise non-specific immune suppression which carries the risk of infection. Peptide immunotherapy is an attractive alternative treatment and is an established treatment for certain diseases such as allergy where the identity of the antigen is known. With the emerging technology of combining random peptide-MHC libraries with combinatorial tetramer staining it is becoming increasingly feasible to predict T cell receptor ligands from the T cell receptor sequence. If we identify specific T cell receptor sequences that are highly expanded in the skin and synovial tissue of patients with psoriatic arthritis this would provide a basis for future studies to identify the T cell ligands and predict the causative peptide/antigen. This would provide the opportunity to develop peptide immunotherapy as a treatment for psoriatic arthritis. In addition, characterisation of the phenotype of clonally expanded cells including the cytokine profile and key transcription factors may identify new therapeutic targets. Thus this project has the potential to positively impact on patient care by contributing information towards the development of peptide immunotherapy or identification of new therapeutic targets for psoriatic arthritis. This would provide an investment opportunity and economic benefit for industry collaborators and has the potential to influence clinical guidelines and practice to improve patient care. Beyond the field of inflammatory arthritis this project applies a novel single cell analysis technique to characterise the clonality and phenotype of human T cells isolated from the site of disease. This technique could be applied to study a range of human diseases. Thus by sharing our methodology and results with the wider academic community we could influence research practice resulting in a potential impact on clinical practice and therapeutics across the field of medicine.

3. Personal development
On a personal level this project will develop my skills as a researcher. I will develop transferrable skills including patient recruitment, laboratory techniques, bioinformatics, critical appraisal and scientific communication. Beyond completion of a PhD and speciality training I hope to be competitive to apply for further funding (for example an MRC Clinician Scientist Fellowship or Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Career Development Fellowship) to enable me to continue to pursue my interest in Rheumatology research. Throughout my career I hope to continue to make contributions to the field of research and clinical care in Rheumatology and mentor and supervise junior colleagues. Thus this project represents an important step in achieving my career goals</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-10-16</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-10-17</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>234036</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/P018904/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>C6D70A71-8796-47BC-AFE0-CC2286E66A06</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>34</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Inflammatory and Immune System</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>149FA87E-B8CD-4FFC-B515-EAD312BED03B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>33</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Musculoskeletal</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>7EE9741E-CF94-420A-B0AB-A7811523CF2C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>33</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Skin</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
