Violence</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/L014971/2</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Violent incidents make up nearly a quarter of crimes recorded in the Crime Survey for England and Wales. The effects are not just those of emotional and physical harm to the individual victim but spread much wider in terms of the impact on healthcare, cost to the criminal justice system, lost working hours, and a societal fear of crime. Unlike acquisitive crimes the motive (and therefore appropriate preventive mechanisms) is arguably less apparent. As such, it is important to identify those changes in personal security and routine activities which can be associated with trends in violence. No systematic research studies have been undertaken to assess the protective impact of these factors in relation to acquaintance and stranger violence, examined separately, to date. The research proposed is precisely concerned with such an assessment. The primary research question is: 

What is the role of population group- and context- specific changes in personal security and routine activities in explaining the decline in stranger and acquaintance violence?

This study will identify the personal security and routine activities measures that offer effective protection from violence and repeat violence to (a) the population overall; (b) specific population subgroups according to their socio-economic attributes; (c) the residents of different areas; and (d) area types and population subgroups plausible combinations in England and Wales and internationally over time.

The urgency to gain insights about violence prevention cannot be exaggerated: at a time of massive public spending cuts and increasing austerity measures, the cost of violence to the UK economy is estimated at &amp;pound;13 billion annually (National Audit Office 2008). 

The proposed research will: 
- Make a major scientific contribution with immediate and high societal and economic impact. Its theoretical and methodological advancements will inform future research developments in criminology. The current gap in knowledge impdes violence reduction opportunities not just in the UK but across the world. 
- Engage throughout with high level research users in the public sector and civil society organisations and inform national and international guidelines on violence prevention. 
- Analyse two decades of formidable existing data sources, the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) and the International Crime Victims Survey (ICVS), both in the public domain, to allow creative and imaginative application and data linking via comparative work. The CSEW is a large and complex dataset with currently some 40,000 respondents annually. The ICVS is a unique comparative crime data partly funded and organised by the Home Office. Yet relative to both data generation cost and their impeccable quality, they have been extremely under-explored.
- Employ innovative research methodology and application in criminology. This includes the Security Impact Assessment Tool and multivariate multilevel logit modelling, pioneered by the co-applicants with ESRC support for assessing the effectiveness of burglary and car security devices and examining the effect of context on the relation between burglary risk and security, respectively; multilevel negative binomial modelling, pioneered by the P-I with American Statistical Association and Home Office support for investigating the effect of context on single and repeat victimisation patterns; and hurdle models which show whether repeat victims differ from others. 
- Engage non-academic partners, the national charity Victim Support and the Nottingham Crime and Drugs Partnership, to triangulate findings, access further data, and ensure direct applicability of findings to victims of violent crime.
- Benefit from collaboration with International Co- Investigators.

Therefore the proposed research fits the ESRC-SDAI Phase 2 call specification. The co-applicants' theoretical, methodological and policy contribution to date ensure its successful delivery.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Violent crime has far reaching social and economic costs - to individuals, local communities, and society in general. This research has been designed to inform future policy guidelines in ways that could lead to considerable financial savings and produce direct benefits to the following groups:
- Victims and repeat victims of violent crime, by informing them of how best to reduce their future risks
- All adults, by informing them of effective personal security measures and violence avoidance behavioural adaptations
- Victim Support as a national charity, by improving their evidence base and analysing their data to enable them to provide a more effective and cost efficient service
- Nottingham Crime and Drugs Partnership in particular and Crime Reduction Partnerships in general, working more effectively and efficiently to discharge their responsibilities 
- Businesses which are affected either directly or indirectly by violent crimes, by informing them how best to contribute to reduction of risks and thus improve security for their staff and customers, and by enabling victims to return to work sooner, respectively.
- The insurance industry, by enabling them to offer incentives for individuals who actively seek to reduce their risk of violence by taking effective security measures
- The security industry, by enabling them to improve products of personal security and better target them according to clients' socio-economic and area profiles 
- Public information by suggesting improvements to the personal security questions of the Crime Prevention Module of the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) and the International Crime Victims Survey and to the routine activities questions of both surveys; and
- Public policy by informing on violence reduction in private and public spheres 

In an indirect way the proposed research will also benefit: 
- The police, by reducing workloads (and thus costs) through reduced violent crimes and by enabling more informed advice to be given to victims and the wider community
- The NHS, by reducing the pressure from violent crime on accident and emergency services
- The society at large, by reducing violence and its impact; 
- The economy, via increased productivity (reducing work days lost as a result of violence)

Public engagement for the duration of the proposed research has been planned to maximise its impact to all research users groups (see Pathways to Impact). In addition the Project Partners will be actively involved in the development and dissemination of the research throughout its duration via their in-kind support in data provision, research planning, interpretation of findings with respect to their policy implications and writing up draft policy outputs (see Letters of Support, Pathways to Impact, Case for Support and Project Partners).

As seen in their respective CVs members of the research team already enjoy close contacts with and serve in bodies responsible for crime measurement and prevention. They are thus accustomed to communicating findings to non-specialists in ways that draw out their policy and practice significance. Past work has already had a substantial impact. Farrell's work on repeat victimisation has found its way into routine policy and practice. Grove's recent work on heritage crime has received substantial media coverage. Tseloni's work has played a pivotal part in official reports of crime statistics and patterns. Tilley wrote the original guidance for analysis for the Crime and Disorder Act (Hough and Tilley 1998) and his work on problem-oriented policing and partnership has had a substantial impact on the work of local police services and partnerships. The findings of the team's past ESRC-funded work (ES/F015186/1) have received substantial media coverage and informed Home Office publications on crime trends. Their current ESRC- funded work (ES/K003771/1) is presently informing burglary target hardening policy interventions in Nottingham.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-09-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>98771</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Northampton</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>EMPAC Local and Community Policing Network</gtr:description><gtr:id>CEE825BE-4215-410D-9875-9957C92FB6ED</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A list of conference presentations and research reports on:

The public and voluntary sector organisations which contributed to the project via the AC included the following:

? Life-skills Education, C.I.C. (a voluntary organisation delivering programmes enhancing young people's resilience in problem solving and communication skills); 
? The Home Office, the Crime Statistics and Violence and Early Offending Units;
? Nottingham Crime and Drugs Partnership (NCDP); and
? Office for National Statistics, who received feedback on BCS/CSEW questionnaire design improvements for gauging additional information on security, guardianship and violence victimisation nationally.

In addition to the Advisory Committee of Stakeholders and Experts (see above) the project team employed the following collaborative and engagement mechanisms:

? Briefing Notes, Summary Reports and Press Releases;
? Twitter account (@project_vio) and project's dedicated website for continuous postings/ opinion exchanges; 
? Radio/TV interviews, newspaper postings, articles in practitioners newsletters and magazines;
? Participation in Local Crime and Safety Partnerships Board meetings;
? Presenting findings in (non-academic) practitioners/ policy national and international conferences;
? Working with national policy representatives and in designing the Nottingham alcohol-related harm reduction plan based upon the project's findings; and
? One-day end of project non-academic conference (see later discussion).

Details can be found in the Portfolio of outcomes section on Researchfish. 

The research has the potential to increase the effectiveness of public services and policy via cost-effective crime prevention, enhance quality of life via crime and fear of crime reduction, and contributed to improving the economic competitiveness of the United Kingdom via promoting safe night-time economy activities. 

The following discussion gives examples of the impact generated from this research to date:

Members of the project team have disseminated the findings to the UK Statistics Authority; the WHO Global Violence Reduction Conference; the ESRC Secondary Data Analysis Initiative (SDAI) Event ('Keep burglars in the dark - Choose Safe Venues and Companions for Drinking &amp;amp; Dancing', 29.2.2016); the National socio-legal training day: Sources and Methods in Criminology and Criminal Justice (19.11.2015); 'The way ahead for Neighbourhood Watch' Event (2-3.12.2015); and in meetings organised by the NCDP - in particular, the Violence Think Tank and the NCDP Board. 

The project's methodology is currently used for testing the effectiveness of two Drinkware initiatives ('Club Crew' and the 'Wouldn't Shouldn't' campaign).

Two members of the Project team (the PI, Prof A. Tseloni, and Co-I, Dr L. Garius) sit in the Steering Group of the Local Alcohol Action Areas: Phase 2 (LAAA2) for Nottinghamshire (including Nottingham city) working on devising and eventually evaluating local policies with regards to the Home Office Programme's Core Challenges 2 to 5, that pertain to safe movement and spaces in the night-time economy, responsible alcohol sales and designing out crime. 

Finally the end of project conference (29.6.2016) focussed on how to both communicate findings to the public and take them forward to influence violence risk awareness and improvements amongst various stakeholders including:

? Home Office related units;
? Licensed premises and insurance sector organisations;
? The Police and the National Police Chief Council;
? Core City Chief Executives and their community safety partnerships;
? Public Health; 
? the NHS; and
? Local Authorities. 

Delegates included the Advisory Committee members (please see earlier discussion), representatives of Police Forces around the country, local councils and others from the above list. The conference was chaired by Peter Moyes, Life-skills Education, C.I.C., who has vast experience in policing and coordinating crime prevention policies at local and regional level.

Speakers from the research-users community at the end of project conference included:
? The Nottinghamshire Police and Crime Commissioner, Paddy Tipping;
? Chief Supt Alex Murray, West Midlands Police and Founder and Chair of the Society of Evidence-Based Policing; 
? Tara Deshpande, Home Office, Head of Crime Insight and Assessment Team, Crime and Policing Knowledge Hub; 
? Dr John Larsen, Director of Evidence and Impact, Drinkaware; and 
? Professor Ken Pease, OBE (Visiting Professor UCL) with vast experience in crime prevention partly in collaboration with the Home Office and Police Forces.

The analysis examined both unweighted and weighted Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) data for the eighteen CSEW sweeps of this period. It also modelled violence counts over victims' demographic, socio-economic characteristics, routine activities and self-reported alcohol and drugs use from two periods: before and after the crime drop in England and Wales.

The second part of this study found that acquaintance violence started to fall first in 1995 while stranger violence did not maintain a sustained fall and peaked much later in 2003/04. The falls in violence incidence rate (number of crimes per 1,000 population) since 1995 were driven by the sharp decline in low seriousness acquaintance violence, especially against males and/or young victims aged 16-24 years old. Declining prevalence rates (number of victims per 1,000 population) was the main driver of acquaintance and stranger violence falls. How repeat violence victims differ from single victims and why the violence falls did not reduce repeat violence victimisation is an important new research question that the study opened up. 

Most stranger violence occurs in and around night-time economy venues and recently public spaces while most acquaintance violence occurs in and around home or work. Being male and self-reported cannabis use were risk factors for frequent stranger and acquaintance violence victimisation prior to the crime drop. Lifestyle/ routine activities trends reveal significant declines in how frequently people visit venues of the night-time economy (pubs, bars, night-clubs) since 1997 and routine activities are significant predictors of frequent stranger and acquaintance violence victimisation after the crime drop. In particular, the most important common risk factor for both types of violence is going to a club at least three times a week. Other common predictors include going to clubs once to twice weekly, going to pubs at least three times per week, being divorced/separated, and similarly to the mid-1990s, being male and cannabis use. Prominent differences in risk factors include heroin and cocaine use which predict only acquaintance violence; and being single which only relates to stranger violence. Considering violence that occurred 15' walk from victim's home, the study established that violence incidence is comparable across Local Authorities in England and Wales. 

With regards to methodological contribution the effect of CSEW weighting and number of crimes per victim truncation methodology on estimated population - specific violence rates was ascertained.
New research networks were formed with the East Midlands Police Academic Collaboration network of six universities and police forces in the region and the University of Lancaster domestic violence team. 
Finally new research skills and capability were developed from training the hired Research Staff to analyse crime counts via multilevel modelling, and access and securely use Special License ONS data.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings can be taken forward via:
