In fact decisions and policies shaping economic activity have long been taken at a range of levels: local, supranational, and international. This project focuses on how businesses participate in economic decision-making at a supranational level. In particular it studies the history of relations between businesses and policy within the British Empire-Commonwealth. 

In the twenty-first century, it is easy to forget that the modern Commonwealth was once a much more tightly integrated association of states. This Empire-Commonwealth was not the same as the British Empire. It was composed of Britain and the empire's self-governing colonies, later dominions, in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Newfoundland and South Africa as well as &amp;Eacute;ire. After the Second World War it expanded to form the Commonwealth of Nations with the admission of former colonies. Prior to the 1960s, it possessed a widely-used currency (sterling), clear consultative mechanisms (imperial conferences), a degree of cooperation on policy areas ranging from defence to regulation, including, from 1932, a co-ordinated tariff policy, although some member states opted out of some of these elements. 

This research project examines how businesses across the Empire-Commonwealth came together to find common interests and shape policy. It focuses in particular on a previously neglected organisation, the Federation of Commonwealth Chambers of Commerce, which brought together delegates from 100 leading cities to debate and agree resolutions on economic policy, and then lobbied governments, especially the British government. It traces the evolution of business interactions with policy-makers within the Empire-Commonwealth from the 1880s down to the 1970s. It shows how these relations originated in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries (often called the first age of globalisation), how businesses and states responded to the fraught conomic conditions of the interwar period, and finally how intra-Commonwealth economic relations first revived and then eroded after 1945. This final period was dominated by two major themes: Britain's relations with Europe, and the emerging goal of fostering economic prosperity in less developed countries. Yet by the 1970s the Empire-Commonwealth had evolved into the much looser Commonwealth of Nations and had ceased to be a meaningful unit within which businesses mobilised. The Commonwealth persisted, but as an international association rather than a unit of supranational governance.

In retracing the history of business and the Empire-Commonwealth, the project offers new understanding of the history of the Commonwealth. In reclaiming the Commonwealth as a supranational unit of governance (but not a superstate), it opens fresh comparisons with other polities past and present. It sheds new light on the evolution of the British economy and state in the twentieth century and particularly on Britain's relations with the EEC/EU. Understanding how businesses interact with policy-making at a supranational level is of inherent interest both to historians and political scientists, but also to business leaders and policy-makers today. Three themes within the research are particularly timely: the re-examination of the economic experience of Empire-Commonwealth during the great depression of the 1930s; a reconsideration of how Britain's links with the Commonwealth shaped relations with Europe; and the generation of fresh understandings of the role of business and of supranational polities in international development. Thus, re-examining the Empire-Commonwealth, and the role played by business within the Empire-Commonwealth, is of significance not merely for our understanding of modern Britain but also promises to shed new light on the global past and present.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Relations between businesses and policy-making are fundamental to the governance of economies. While a good deal of attention has been played to these interactions at the level of the nation state, other levels - local, supranational, global - have been far less consistently studied. This research project focuses on relations between business and the British Empire-Commonwealth and, in line with the AHRC's Care for the Future Theme, new understandings of the past will be generated with the potential to illuminate the present. Within this context, particular episodes, such as the response of business associations within Empire-Commonwealth to the 1930s depression, the emergent development agenda after 1945, or Britain's relations with Europe will be of particular interest. There are four main clusters of beneficiaries.

First, the reconsideration of the Commonwealth and the relationship between particular localities and the Commonwealth will be of inherent interest to a wider public and the media. While the profile of the Commonwealth in Britain ebbs and flows, in the next half decade attention is likely to revive through the combination of the 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games; the First World War commemorations; and debates about Britain's place in Europe and Scottish Independence. On this basis, local engagement activities will share the fruits of the project with local communities. The PI will undertake public engagement in Aberdeen through a dedicated Caf&amp;eacute; event organised by the University of Aberdeen and in London through the London Metropolitan Archive's events programme. Finally, in collaboration with the Menzies Centre for Australian Studies at King's College London, the PI will deliver a public lecture considering Australian business and the Commonwealth to the British Australasian Society.

Second, the research also focuses on business mobilisation within the Empire-Commonwealth. Understanding how and with what success business associations can shape policyagendas within supranational polities remains a key interest for a range of business associations. Through the project, a dialogue will be maintained with chambers of commerce, particularly the London and Aberdeen Chambers of Commerce. Moreover history of business association within the Commonwealth will be of direct interest to the Commonwealth Business Council, founded in 1997, to bring together businesses across the contemporary Commonwealth. 

Third, the re-examination of the economics of Britain's relationship with Commonwealth and the EEC inherent in the project will be of interest to policy-makers and in public discourse. Interest in Britain's turn from the Commonwealth towards Europe is likely to revive over the next few years, in particular given proposals for a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU. Fresh insights into the history of the Commonwealth will, therefore, become relevant to public and policy discussion. The PI will open dialogue with HM Treasury and collaborate with the History and Policy Unit at King's College London, which possesses a well-developed network of connections in policy and media circles, to develop timely policy briefings on these issues. Where appropriate, he will also work with Aberdeen's Centre for Global Governance and Security to disseminate findings at EU level.

Finally, the research project will shed new light on current discussions about the potential role of 'corporate social responsibility' in fostering international development by providing historical perspective. As a result it will be of interest to the organisations and individuals pursuing the development agenda. The Centre for Sustainable International Development possesses strong contacts with this community. Given the multiple and diverse audiences involved, the PI will work with the Centre to offer an article to The Conversation. On that basis, he will use networks built by the Centre to engage interested parties at appropriate junctures.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>177245</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Participant in Event on 'Historicans and Brexit' hosted by History and Policy at King's College London</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A794331F-14CC-4FC0-8322-88E5ED9C83D9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In November 2016 I acted as a discussant and panel member in the final session of an afternoon event organised by History and Policy in KCL focusing on the debate on Brexit and placing it in historical context.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58a19771bf4627.93626283</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Contributed Article to London Metropolitan Archive Newsletter</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>28586BC2-ABEF-44CC-A934-8C0ACA8B5E51</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I contributed an article to the London Metropolitan Archive Newsletter, due to be sent out in Feb 2016.

I wrote an article based on the research for The Conversation (see impacts) which linked research on the Commonwealth to the Brexit Debate. In 10 months since publication last April this attracted about 6,000 reads, half outside the UK. Thus the research through the piece has contributed to an ongoing public debate on a significant policy issue. On this basis in June 2016 I was extensively interviewed on the history of the Commonwealth and of Commonwealth trade by ABC Radio National's Rear Vision programme. The programme on the Commonwealth post-Brexit was broadcast on 31 July 2016, and is now available as a podcast (and the programme's podcasts average 75,000 downloads a month), transforming research findings into a permanent contribution to and resource for public debate. Further engagement and dissemination activities (recorded in this submission) and forthcoming will continue to disseminate research findings relevant to current policy discourse to appropriate audiences.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>BA67647B-9C8C-40A3-AC0C-D286C3D8765E</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56bca03c8a67b3.65008931</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The key findings are still being interpreted but as a result of the award, as per the original objectives, a comprehensive reconsideration of the political economy of the Commonwealth has been possible on the basis of research focusing on business associations. Key findings include the importance, historically, for trade of non-tariff barriers (regulations on a host of matters from weights and measures to certificates of origin) and also of a developing awareness within the British Empire/Commonwealth of a powerful role for the state at supranational level in fostering trade. At the same time it has become clear that the increasingly devolved structures of governance and (in the end) location of sovereignty in the Commonwealth made it a poor vehicle for the full realisation of these applications down to the 1960s when new regional frameworks for trade in any case superseded the Commonwealth (not least for the UK the EEC - later EU - which DID pool sovereignty). Thus the greater potential for trade within a rules-based supranational system becomes clear, and the degree to which such a system rests on states pooling sovereignty and decision-making. 

A further are of insight regards the historical operation of business associations. In particular it is increasingly clear that business mobalisation at an empire-Commonwealth leavel was predicated on the existence on a meaningful framework of governance. In this sense politics shaped the formation of economic networks and the articulation of political economy, rather than economics determining political forms. The research asserts the primacy of political over economic considerations in shaping interactions between business lobbies and states and supra-national entities such as the empire-Commonwealth. 

Publicatoins based on this research are in progress, most extensively a 125,000 monograph 'Commerce and the Commonwealth' contracted to be published by Oxford University Press in 2018.

As well as challenging aspects of the existing literature on the economics of empire and reasserting the relevance of the Commonwealth as a unit of analysis, these findings have been applied to the current debate on Brexit. 

There are no further details on the web beyond those in the various publications but a brief initial application to the Brexit debate can be found at https://theconversation.com/the-commonwealth-is-not-an-alternative-to-the-eu-for-britain-57009</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>For now the findings are being written up. Within academia there is further work to be done on the dynamics of, and limitations of, Commonwealth governance in other policy areas especially immigration and defence. There is also a lot of comparative work to be done on the political economy of supranational polities within which this research on the Commonwealth can be located. The approach in the project using business associations as a lens could be usefully applied elsewhere.

Beyond the academe, the research has insights into effective business lobbying (and the relationship with political objectives) which could be taken up by business associations, and at the same time the broad issue of the interplay of economic exchange and supranational governance is highly relevant in a post-Brexit, post-Trump world in which sovereignty is being reasserted at the expense of supra-national governance. The Commonwealth may achieve a revival of interest in this context as a 'third way' which attempts to reconcile supranationalism with sovereignty. This research potentially allows interested parties to explore and critique that 'third way'.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D901E9F2-B15D-4106-B82D-90209AC822CF</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56bca06ec679e2.31188798</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Security and Diplomacy,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>CDFD2E03-F767-471C-B4D0-D47E6EDCCC5B</gtr:id><gtr:title>AFTER THE BRITISH WORLD</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Historical Journal</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7c504be4e25dae092a80b9d2108bc7f2"><gtr:id>7c504be4e25dae092a80b9d2108bc7f2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>BRIGHT R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>58a192bb0cc0b2.40339880</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/M00662X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DCE73056-5E3D-4976-B573-234E5FF4D633</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic &amp; Social History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>319D6F57-4306-40E8-9F0A-84D514AAF7FC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Imperial/Colonial History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3CE20DB9-873E-489F-BBC7-3F05BD0D900C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F7EEE6CD-E283-4BAB-BA5E-70B4B0F1F1A6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
