Multi-dimensional dynamic processes can be presented aurally and, for example, broken down into component parts. Interactive experimentation with the techniques facilitates development of an understanding of their creative potential and the significance of the way they are used in a particular work. Software can also be used to create reductive sketches demonstrating underlying structures aurally. The software is also able to play precise extracts from the original work. Passages can be compared and the development of musical material traced aurally. Such extracts are taken directly from the CD recording without infringing copyright. \n\nBased on an initial trial of such an approach in my analysis of Jonathan Harvey's Mortuos Plango, Vivos Voco, this project aims to significantly develop and refine the techniques used there. In particular, it will address new issues by analysing two contrasting works, highly acclaimed representatives of different aspects of electroacoustic music. One is an acousmatic work, Wind Chimes by Denis Smalley, in which the spectral evolution of sounds (its 'spectromorphology') plays a major structural role. The other work is a mixed media work, Anth&amp;egrave;mes 2 by Pierre Boulez, combining traditional acoustic instruments with electronic processing. Both works require significant developments to the interactive aural approach and new software developments.\n\nThe two analyses will be published as a written text accompanied by software (see Case for Support for details). But they will also serve as a means of developing the interactive aural approach so that it can encompass a broad range of electroacoustic music. A paper will be published discussing the development of the approach and the software tools used will be made available on-line. It is intended that through this project a signifiant new approach to studying electroacoustic music will be established and made available for others to use. By enabling people to engage with the musical structures aurally and interactively they will be understood more fully. By presenting the techniques used in a work in a user-friendly interactive environment the aim is to help bridge the gap between science and music leading to greater understanding not only of particular works but of the interrelation of technology and creativity in electroacoustic music more generally. The resource developed through this project should be a significant new development in the study of electroacoustic music, facilitating a deeper and broader appreciation and understanding of it.\n\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>39464</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project continued the development of 'Interactive Aural Analysis' a new approach to the analysis of music, especially computer music, in which software is used, alongside written text.
