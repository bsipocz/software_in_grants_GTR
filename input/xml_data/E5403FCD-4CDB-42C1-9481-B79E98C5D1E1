These products were seen as symbols of modernity and liberation in other countries, but rising standards actually created more work for the housewife, with ideas of female self-worth becoming tied up in domestic labour. This project will use oral history, archival research and object analysis to investigate the meanings of these imported electrical products in rural Ireland in the 1950s and 1960s, particularly in relation to dominant Catholic attitudes to women and domestic work, emphasising the sole social role of women as remaining in the home. This project builds on the PIs existing PhD research on design, electrical technology and national identity in 1920s Ireland.

The project will engage in project partnership with the National Museum of Ireland Country Life (NMI), the main centre for research into the material culture of rural Ireland, and includes an intergenerational oral history project with members of the Irish Countrywomen's Association (ICA). It will work with the organisation historically responsible for rural electrification, the ESB, civic and third sector organisations for the elderly and museums with electrical product collections, in order to promote collaboration, knowledge exchange and community engagement. It is extremely important that this oral history research be carried out now, as this generation of women are in their 70s and 80s, and it is vital to record their first-hand testimony now. It will also produce creative and academic outputs, including a website, social media, exhibition and events programme, which will allow elderly women's voices to be heard and valued in a public forum and contribute to their wellbeing. It is also very timely from an academic point of view, due to the increasing interest in post-war domesticity in Irish history and area studies, where object-based analysis is not well developed, and the project will foreground the usefulness of design historical methods in understanding the materiality of post-war life. 

The research will be of direct interest to the generation of women who ran such homes, as well as a wider public in Ireland and the Irish diaspora who grew up in such interiors. The initial direct benefit would be to elderly Irish women by contributing to their wellbeing and sense of value in the community. The research collaborations with museums will also benefit them by aiding them in their interpretation of their collections and emphasising their contemporary relevance. Other beneficiaries would be age charities and nursing homes, as the oral history research could later be incorporated into reminiscence therapy, both in residential care and in the community. 

In terms of collaboration and leadership activities, the overall project would be relevant to researchers in the fields of Irish design, technology and design history, Irish history and Irish Studies, as well as researchers working on the home in other national contexts (e.g. UK, Denmark, USA, etc.); also anyone with an interest in the cultural context of electrical products, including product designers, engineers and interior designers. The study will be located within design history, but with influence from the history of technology and social history, making use of oral history, archival research and object analysis. It would also contribute specifically to the national discourse on Irish design, opening it up to an engagement with issues concerning domesticity and the role of women and technology. It would be the first research project of this scale on Irish design history, and by expanding the outputs past academic publication, would provide an example of best practice for researchers in both Irish design history and for other researchers considering material objects in a historical context.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The PI will engage with collaborators such as the Electricity Supply Board (ESB), the National Museum of Ireland, Country Life (NMI) and civic organisations such as Age &amp;amp; Opportunity and the Irish Countrywomen's Association (ICA), as well as Irish nursing homes. The project will relate to a number of groups:

1) The project's main impact will be with elderly Irish women who were rural housewives in the 1950s and 1960s, affirming the importance of their life experiences to Irish society and improving their well-being. This will partly be through their involvement with the oral history aspect of the project, but also the programme of arts and heritage events running in conjunction with the exhibition. It is envisaged that the exhibition event programme will include events co-ordinated in conjunction with Age &amp;amp; Opportunity projects such as the Wandering Methods art project responding to exhibition objects, and the yearly Bealtaine festival of creativity in older age.

2) The main benefit to civic institutions such as the ICA and nursing homes will be to their members, residents and staff, both young and old. The communities of older women represented above are central to this project and will foreground the value of their life experience and value, to the younger members of their community and to wider civic society. Charity organisations such as Age &amp;amp; Opportunity will be aided in fulfilling their goal of inspiring older people to their full potential, by facilitating opportunities in arts and culture, as above. The use of social media not just to disseminate updates and information about the project, but to crowdsource products and additional interviewees is likely to come through the younger relatives and friends of such women, helping to cement intergenerational links.

3) The project will impact public sector organisations including the Electricity Supply Board (ESB), whose archive collects material relating to the semi-state's organisational history, but relies on external academics to interpret and disseminate its collection of material on electricity and electrification in Ireland. As the main archival and object source, this project will play an important role in interpreting their collection for the previous groups mentioned above and the general public.

4) Museums with collections of domestic electrical products will particularly benefit from the exhibition output, contributing to their understanding of their own collections, as well as exhibiting them to interested publics. The curated exhibition in the NMI Castlebar will increase their visitor numbers and create employment in the museum sector in rural Ireland, including the engagement of a professional exhibition designer to materialise the final exhibition. The series of public talks by the PI and other stakeholders will enhance the impact of the exhibition and develop further dialogue on issues surrounding domestic electrical products, the role of women in the home and aging with dignity.

5) The project will also impact on a larger section of the general public, contributing to the ongoing public debate about the role of women in Irish society. This wider audience will be engaged through the exhibition and the associated event programme, as well as through the website, social media and coverage in the national media (e.g. The Irish Times and RT&amp;Eacute;).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>199813</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>National Museum of Ireland</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Ireland, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>National Museum of Ireland, Country Life</gtr:description><gtr:id>AB0149FC-2921-49CF-B3AE-C266087DAD8E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Most of these outputs are still pending, as the project is in the first year, but they have already included:

This involves training one (or two) younger women from the community in oral history recording techniques, and providing them with the recorders and other tools to carry out the project. They then carry out the interviews, and the recorders are sent back to the PI, who organises for transcription and editing of the files, and sends back copies of the recordings to the interviewees, for their own use, according to best practice in the field.</gtr:description><gtr:id>84A079EA-A67F-4CCB-9C16-4CA50746B14F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This research method has a direct impact on both the interviewers and interviewees, contributing to their wellbeing and sense of value in the community, as well as strengthening community links.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58a3a5a69dfc67.71839524</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Community Oral History Interviewing</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/N006224/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DB058E35-DBAD-4B21-B030-5C3C78825B11</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Area Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>608431EA-925E-44D8-A1E2-8C24B4768085</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9E4BDAC2-CD51-4625-BCC1-5F768EE168D0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DCE73056-5E3D-4976-B573-234E5FF4D633</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic &amp; Social History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3EA5AAEC-135B-436C-8F77-F32CCCA7FF8A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>European Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E5E4CBFA-1AC0-405D-A6EC-46A5C0B6704F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History of Sci./Med./Technol.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
