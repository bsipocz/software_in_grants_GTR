While the physical principles governing the dynamics of non-equilibrium systems have emerged over the past two decades, how these principles are realised for the regulation of vital biological processes remains poorly understood. The goal of the proposed research is to develop an in-depth physical understanding of the regulatory mechanisms controlling bacterial growth, shape development, and adaptive response to antibiotics. 

Bacterial growth and shapes are determined by the cell wall, a rigid protein-based structure that can withstand high amounts of osmotic pressure while driving cell elongation. An outstanding challenge is to relate alterations in physical properties of the cell wall to adaptive shape changes and fitness control in bacteria. This is important for understanding how bacteria can recover their fitness for growth and division under antibiotic treatment that inhibit the cell wall growth machinery. We seek to address this challenge by proposing a novel framework in which theoretical modelling and experimental data are integrated to dissect how protein synthesis and stochastic cell cycle processes control robust growth and adaptive behaviour in single bacterial cells.

Using tools from statistical mechanics and soft matter physics, we will develop a quantitative model for growing cell wall structures that is coupled to stochastic decision-making processes for cell size and division control. We will extend this model to dissect how single bacterial cells harness the feedback between mechanical forces and biochemical reactions to adapt to growth inhibitory stresses. In particular, we will dissect the mechanisms of fitness recovery in rod-shaped bacterium under ribosome-targeting antibiotics that constitute a major class of clinically used antibacterial drugs. We will compare the theoretical model predictions against high-throughput experimental measurements of single bacterial shape and growth in normal and antibiotic-treated conditions. This integrated approach will allow us to determine the physical principles relating the speed and the accuracy of antibiotic adaptation to the energy consumption budget of a cell. 

The outcome of this research will fundamentally advance our understanding of non-equilibrium physics of living systems by establishing a cost-performance tradeoff relation in adaptive biophysical processes. Furthermore we will directly address the physical impacts of antibacterial drugs on bacterial fitness at the single-cell level, which will have wide ranging implications for the development and design of new drugs that can effectively control the evolution of antibiotic resistance.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our proposed research aims to determine the role of cell wall physical properties and cell shape on antibiotic resistance. We aim to relate the changes in cell wall mechano-chemistry and the resultant cell shape perturbation to fitness alterations in drug-resistant bacteria. This understanding will benefit a wide range of academics working in the field of microbiology, biophysics, biochemistry and physics. Our theoretical modelling approach, in combination with experimental validation, will uncover the feedback between protein translation and bacterial morphologies in antibiotic resistance, which will benefit biomedical researchers in the UK by developing effective strategies for drug development. The PI will actively engage with microbiologists, and clinicians with the aim of translating theoretical insights gained from in silico modelling into experimental realisation and drug development. This will enable exploring the potential of new and existing antimicrobial therapies. 

To ensure that our research achieves a wide-ranging impact, we aim to present our research findings in high profile domestic and international conferences, including microbiology conferences (ASM), and interdisciplinary conferences (APS march meeting, Biophysical society meeting). We also aim to publish our results in a timely manner to high-impact open access journals that have a broad interdisciplinary readership. This will enable timely dissemination of our results to the general public. We will ensure that our work reaches out to the wider scientific community through frequent consultations with the UCL Institute for the Physics of Living Systems and the UCL network for antimicrobial resistance.

The proposed research lies at the interface of physical and biology, providing enormous transformative potential. On the physics side, we will connect to the fast evolving field of active matter, which is exemplified by the bacterial cell wall that harnesses biochemical energy for mechanical stress generation during growth. While the general principles of far from equilibrium systems have emerged over the past two decades, how they are realised for specific living systems remains an open challenge. We will take a first step in this direction by relating the energetic cost of bacterial growth to the speed and accuracy of adaptive response. This will fundamentally advance our understanding of non-equilibrium physics of living systems. On the biology side, we will identify the adaptive roles of cell wall physical properties on the development of antibiotic resistance at the single-cell level. 

We expect that our theoretical model will attract interest from the microbiology and biophysics community, fostering new international collaborations throughout the grant period. The PI will initiate new collaborations to apply the bacterial growth model to other pathogens (E. coli, S. aureus etc) where mechanical alterations in the cell wall have been identified to induce adaptive behaviour. Further, We will carry out prototype in silico experiments to demonstrate the capability of our computational model in predicting the outcome of ribosome targeting antibiotics and cytoskeletal drugs on adaptive division control and fitness regulation in bacteria. 

The interdisciplinary nature of our research will impart cross-disciplinary training to students and the postdoctoral researcher (PDRA) involved in the project. The PDRA will develop expertise in scientific computing and quantitative modelling, which will be indispensable in a variety of disciplines. The PDRA will also be involved in mentoring students, which will enable him/her to gain leadership skills. This will boost the PDRA's progress towards becoming an independent researcher. Furthermore, the PDRA will acquire various skills from this project that can be applied to different sectors, including collaborative team-work, project management, communications skills and commercial awareness.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>216297</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R029822/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F442B6BE-8B89-4C01-8D3B-E8A4D320B672</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biomolecules &amp; biochemistry</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>02FE9751-1497-4DFD-B349-D4A9C96538E1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biophysics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
