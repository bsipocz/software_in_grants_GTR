The majority of nematodes are free-living, feeding on microorganisms, but a significant number are parasites of animals or plants. Nematode parasites of humans make a substantial contribution to the global burden of disease, with a handful of nematode species annually accounting for some 46 million disability adjusted life years (DALYs), and plant parasites are responsible for global crop losses estimated at $100 billion each year. Although there are some effective treatments for these parasites, increases in the number and distribution of strains that are resistant to these drugs mean that there is a need to develop new therapeutic treatments. Ideal targets for the development of new therapeutics would be molecules and processes that are found only in nematodes, but are absent from the animals and plants that they infect. Ideally the therapeutic target would be one that is found in all nematodes enabling the development of a drug active against a broad range of nematode infections. One such process is spliced leader trans-splicing, which is an essential part of the way that genes are expressed in nematodes. While we have a good understanding of the main events in this process there have been no systematic investigations into the molecules that are involved. We have identified a new experimental approach to investigate this process in the major experimental system used to study nematode biology, C. elegans. Using this system, we have shown for the first time that is possible to visualise, through changes in the expression of a fluorescent protein, alterations in spliced leader trans-splicing in living animals. We will use this breakthrough to better understand sliced leader trans-splicing, and thereby improve the knowledge upon which the development of new anthelmintic drugs depends.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Spliced leader trans-splicing is an essential, but poorly understood process that occurs in many eukaryotes, including those that are major parasites of human, animals and plants. Arguably the organism in which spliced leader trans-splicing is best understood is C. elegans and work in this system underpins much of our current understanding of this process. Despite the fact that the basic steps in spliced leader trans-splicing are known, how these steps are achieved at the molecular level is not understood. To address this we have recently developed a novel, sensitive screening strategy that allows us, for the first time in any experimental system, to visualise loss of spliced leader trans-splicing in vivo. Importantly, we have validated our assay by showing that it is able to detect sub-lethal defects in this process, and have used this assay to show the involvement of three proteins previously implicated in in vitro experiments. The experiments outlined in this proposal build upon this work and aim to carry out the first comprehensive, genome-wide survey of the genes involved in spliced leader trans-splicing. Using our combined expertise in C. elegans genetics and the biochemistry of protein-RNA complexes we will characterise the components we identify and so obtain a better understanding of this process. Given that spliced leader trans-splicing is found in most, if not all, nematodes that affect human and animal health, as well as crop yields, it is likely our findings will ultimately have an impact in these areas of healthcare and food security.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The main beneficiaries of the proposed research would be those individuals and organisations that are focussed upon combating nematodes parasites that affect humans and the animals and plants that are important for human health and well-being. Our research has the potential to identify novel therapeutic targets that would be of interest to pharmaceutical companies, or charitable foundations with an interest in treating neglected tropical diseases. Moreover, the system that we have developed to screen for molecules involved in spliced leader trans-splicing can be readily adapted into an automated, high-throughput screening system to identify chemical inhibitors of spliced leader trans-splicing that could serve as the basis of novel therapeutics, which would have application in the treatment of a broad range of nematode infections of human, animal and plants. Again, there may be commercial interests that would benefit from this knowledge.

The research postholder will also benefit through the training associated with the research position, and through the networking and skills obtained through our collaboration with Professor Blumenthal's laboratory at the University of Colorado. 

The wider UK community will potentially benefit from the project, since it is likely to significantly improve our understanding of a fundamental and essential process that is specific to nematode biology. Given the importance of nematodes in terms of global public and animal health, economics and food security, applications of the research offer long-term benefits in terms of new treatments and control measures for nematode diseases. 

The wider community (including school children, teachers and the local farming community) will also benefit from initiatives to discuss, and in some cases participate, in the proposed research, and gain an understanding of how the research outcomes could affect them.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-08-12</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-08-13</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>350236</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>23353</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Confidence In Concept</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-02-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Medical Research Council (MRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>MC_PC_14114 v.2</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>C525024C-2BEA-4918-BEE9-30E9F34B606D</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c6c2131023e5.09464771</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-07-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>15000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Sparking Impact</gtr:description><gtr:end>2015-05-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>839574FA-D472-416A-BB65-76C9C212FBDB</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c6c32a661441.67369603</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>We have collaborated with the Drug Discovery Unit at the University of Dundee and European Lead Factory (ELF), Newhouse to develop high throughput drug screens based on our assay. Using a BBSRC 'Sparking Impact' award we commissioned market research into the anthelmintic market which we used to successfully obtain funding through an MRC Confidence in Concept application. This has allowed us to further refine the SL trans-splicing assay to make it more suitable for application to high throughput screens. We have identified a compound that activates our reporter system and qRT-PCR assays confirm that SL trans-splicing is inhibited in the presence of this compound. We have also refined the genotype of the strain used in the screen. Our revised assay is now suitable for high-throughput screens, and we have collaborated with the ELF to screen through their compound libraries. We are now verifying a number of possible positive compounds from these screens.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>67FD2316-E02E-4DBA-A2AF-BE8AEC49D5FA</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>545f97f8198e99.44823131</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Spliced leader (SL) trans-splicing is an essential step in the activity of most genes in C. elegans and other nematodes. We have refined our screening strategy as outlined in the original grant application. The screen uses a green fluorescent protein (GFP) based transgene that lacks a translation initiation codon (consisting of the bases AUG), so in wild type nematodes there is no fluorescence. However, there is an engineered AUG codon upstream of the trans-splice site, which is removed during SL trans-splicing of the pre-mRNA. Animals with reduced SL trans-splicing accumulate mRNA containing this engineered AUG and are thus able to express GFP and fluoresce. 

Pilot genetic screens showed that our initial transgene assay was sensitive to mutations in the nonsense mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway, apparently because the SL trans-spliced GFP mRNA is translated with low efficiency from the mutated initiator codon (CUG). We found that in wild type animals the levels of this SL trans-spliced GFP mRNA are kept low by NMD function, but in NMD mutants it accumulates to high enough levels that the low efficiency translation results GFP fluorescence. Thus the recovery of mutations in the NMD pathway was an artefact of our original assay system.

We modified the SL trans-splicing reporter transgene to prevent the low level translation of the SL trans-spliced mRNA and showed that it is not sensitive to loss of NMD function. We carried out a large-scale clonal genetic screen using this transgene and identified 15 viable and 3 sterile mutants that express high levels of GFP fluorescence. Importantly, two of the viable mutations are alleles of sna-1, a gene previously shown to be involved in SL trans-splicing, thus validating our revised assay. We are currently carrying out the whole genome sequence (WGS) based mapping of the sterile mutants to identify the nature of the genes affected. 

To validate our GFP assay we developed a quantitative qRT-PCR assay to detect reduced SL trans-splicing. Disappointingly, application of this assay to the viable mutants that activate our transgene shows that with the exception of the two sna-1 mutants, none of them display obvious defects in SL trans-splicing. Thus these mutants result in activation of our reporter assay through an unanticipated mechanism. Identification of the molecular basis for three of these mutations reveals that they are missense mutations in the cdc-6 and cdk-2 genes, which are known regulators of the cell cycle. It is likely that these mutations affect our assay by increasing the expression from the vit-2 promoter used in our reporter assay, boosting the small amount of non-trans-spliced GFP mRNA above the detection threshold. 

The fact that only two of the viable mutations from our screen (the two sna-1 alleles) affect SL trans-splicing suggests that there are unlikely to be additional genes involved in SL trans-splicing whose loss of function phenotype is viable. This is supported by the results of our candidate gene RNAi screens. We have investigated the role of genes that encode components of the SL ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex, or likely to be required for its biogenesis. In all cases, these lead to strong activation of our reporter assay, but are associated with embryonic lethality in the offspring of the affected animals. A manuscript describing this work is currently in preparation, and we plan to continue our work on SL trans-splicing in this direction.

In parallel to this work we have investigated the relationship between SL trans-splicing and operon organisation in other nematodes. This work, which was published in Genetics, is important because it shows that operons (clusters of genes which produce polycistronic pre-RNA and require SL trans-splicing for processing) are conserved throughout the nematode phylum. Thus the development of drugs that target SL trans-splicing would likely significantly impair gene expression in a wide-range of nematode parasites.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Although the genetic screen has not lead to the identification of new components of SL trans-splicing, the RNAi candidate screen has shown that the SL RNP is processed similarly to the snRNPs that are involved in cis-splicing. This means that understanding of SL trans-splicing should be focusing on understanding the functions of the taxonomically restricted components of SL RNP, and how they are integrated with the highly conserved biogenesis factors. We, and others will continue this work.

We have shown that our transgene assay can be used as the basis of a high-throughput system to identify compounds that inhibit SL trans-splicing. Since this process is essential for nematode gene expression, but is not found in vertebrates or plants, it represents an excellent target for the development of novel anthelmintics. The advantage of targeting a process rather than a single molecule may mean that we can address the difficulties associated with drug resistance associated with previous drug treatment strategies.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>31A5ECF3-8D6E-494D-B0F1-31E30DF981BE</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545f59a0a51f58.61726017</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>01B5508C-F206-49CF-A382-09FD2ABBD943</gtr:id><gtr:title>Operons are a conserved feature of nematode genomes.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Genetics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/5fa50d7cfd1df57e192c4603bf88c3ba"><gtr:id>5fa50d7cfd1df57e192c4603bf88c3ba</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pettitt J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0016-6731</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>542d604eea60b0.92356715</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>783CBA60-3058-4392-AE77-00B9B65D933D</gtr:id><gtr:title>An in vivo genetic screen for genes involved in spliced leader trans-splicing indicates a crucial role for continuous de novo spliced leader RNP assembly.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nucleic acids research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ff1d447a732d6ffb80de96226b20f8b2"><gtr:id>ff1d447a732d6ffb80de96226b20f8b2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Philippe L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0305-1048</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a72033cddbb47.97881915</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/J007137/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>A442BF36-F335-483E-9282-F3BB48AC2C47</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cell biology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C23BE70F-1EF6-4CC7-88B0-841CB18DD875</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Genetics &amp; development</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9898EFC8-73AB-4E1E-A207-04A486D9F1A9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Animal developmental biology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D16FDB98-8CBA-4298-8ACD-955DF734E7F5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cells</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>CC10CC12-1D16-48BD-8F66-6A64A651DEAB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Gene action &amp; regulation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D3C718B2-93A6-47C3-A0F0-F426AC23276E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Genome organisation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
