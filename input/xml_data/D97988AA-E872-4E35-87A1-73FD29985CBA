It continues to cause disease worldwide, killing over 4,000 people per day, and is becoming progressively more resistant to the antibiotics used to treat it. New innovative approaches to control the disease are urgently needed as standard diagnosis and treatment have remained largely unchanged for the last 30 years. Tuberculosis causes very extensive damage to the lungs and we have shown that this releases small fragments of lung fibrils into the bloodstream. Lung destruction differs between men and women with tuberculosis, and also when tuberculosis occurs in the context of HIV infection. Professor Paul Elkington's research group has previously studied a small number of the fragments released by infection, but as the lung is a highly complex network of interconnected fibrils many fragments will be produced in tuberculosis. This project will measure the full range of fragments using a new type of analytical system called proteomics that can identify all the proteins in a single sample. These fragments can then be used to develop tests to identify patients who are coughing tuberculosis and actively infecting others, and also to monitor the effect of new treatments.

I will analyse samples that have been collected as part of other studies and include the important groups for comparison: men and women, HIV uninfected and HIV infected individuals, and patients with other respiratory conditions who have symptoms suggestive of tuberculosis. First, I will measure all the matrix breakdown products in a small number of samples using a highly sensitive but time-intensive testing system comparing patients with active tuberculosis with healthy controls. Next, I will perform detailed computational analysis of all the fragments identified and how they differ between the groups. Once the most interesting fragments are identified, I will measure these using rapid, high-throughput approaches in a much larger number of samples, including individuals with other respiratory conditions that can mimic tuberculosis to characterise the diagnostic potential as a test to exclude tuberculosis. Finally, I will study these fragments in patients of different ethnic origin and various manifestations of tuberculosis. This study will perform the first systematic investigation of lung matrix degradation products in tuberculosis and I will identify fragments that can be used to develop a new diagnostic test to break the cycle of infection. The project will also provide me with an excellent training in cutting edge medical research methods that can be used to address a wide range of human diseases.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Innovative approaches are required to control the global tuberculosis pandemic. In the absence of an efficacious vaccine to prevent lung disease, identifying and treating individuals with pulmonary disease who drive transmission is the best way to reduce incidence. However, current diagnostic tests are not suitable for population screening. We have shown that matrix degradation products released by TB-induced immunopathology are plasma correlates of lung disease using a hypothesis-driven approach. Lung disease differs between men and women, and between TB in immunocompetent and HIV-infected individuals. Matrix destruction will release many peptide fragments but only a fraction of these have been analysed.

This project will perform the first unbiased analysis of matrix degradation products in TB across all the key patient groups using a unique non-depletion based proteomic strategy developed in Southampton by Dr Spiro Garbis. First we will analyse archived samples from a South African cohort, studying healthy controls and TB patients including men and women and HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected individuals in equal number. Subsequent bioinformatic processing of the raw proteomic datasets will be supervised by Dr Christopher Woelk. Next, once key matrix fragments are identified, we will study these in a much larger cohort by Parallel Reaction Monitoring (PRM), Luminex array and ELISA, including the control group of respiratory symptomatics with TB symptoms but alternative final diagnoses. Finally, we will investigate matrix turnover in a UK cohort of mixed ethnicity and diverse clinical manifestation of TB.

I will perform the first systematic analysis of matrix degradation in TB, based on clinical observations and strong published and unpublished data. It will provide me with a broad training in widely applicable research methodology, including proteomics, bioinformatics, Luminex arrays and the statistical integration of clinical and laboratory data.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Impacts will be related both to the tuberculosis (TB) field and also more widely to the knowledge economy. The results will be relevant to a wide number of lung diseases characterised by tissue destruction, such as emphysema, the acute respiratory distress syndrome and pulmonary fibrosis, and also inflammatory diseases involving remodelling of the extracellular matrix, such as atherosclerosis, cancer invasion and rheumatoid arthritis. Furthermore, the work will be of interest to pharmaceutical companies as it is directly translational and is likely to identify a range of biomarkers that can be used as surrogate markers of outcome for a range of clinical trials.
Health and social impacts
This project has the potential to save lives and decrease the long-term morbidity from TB by providing the markers to identify and treat infectious patients much earlier in their disease pathway. Consequently, this project may have a far-reaching effect, improving TB care for patients both in the UK and worldwide. Improved TB treatment has health and social benefits which would be most dramatically felt in Sub-Saharan Africa, which has one of the highest incidence rates of TB, and China and India that have the greatest numerical burden of disease. Ultimately, this will also benefit the UK, as the incidence of imported TB cases will fall. The realistic time scale for new diagnostics to be introduced from this work and these benefits be realised would be ten to fifteen years.
Economic impacts
Current methods for the diagnosis and monitoring of TB in developing countries rely almost exclusively on sputum microscopy and culture which has poor sensitivity. GeneXpert has been introduced to some mid-income countries but is too expensive for population screening. The project will define whether matrix degradation products (MDPs) can be used as a novel diagnostic approach and as markers for disease progression. These can then be used to develop a near patient test for diagnosis and monitoring in TB. We have already shown that some MDPs are significantly elevated in the sputum and blood of patients with TB and this project will systematically characterise all MDPs. This has the potential to decrease the time taken to diagnose TB, resulting in fewer community transmissions, and may allow more rapid identification of those not responding to treatment, acting as an early indicator of drug resistance. 
The University of Southampton EPSRC-funded grant &amp;quot;Lab-Flo&amp;quot; is developing an affordable near-patient test and using TB as the paradigm disease for product development. Paul Elkington is a key collaborator on the grant and the first assay being optimised is the matrix degradation product PIIINP from type III collagen for TB testing. Therefore, the combination of my work and this diagnostic platform may produce a population screening test to address TB transmission.
Training benefits
From a personal point of view, this fellowship will train me in the skills required to pursue a career as a clinical researcher. During this time I will undertake formal training as part of the PhD programme at the University of Southampton and will develop my laboratory, analytical and leadership skills. This will enable me to have the personal skills required to eventually run a research group within the next 10 years and after completing my specialty training in Respiratory Medicine. I am specifically training in the emerging technologies of proteomics and bioinformatics, with statistical integration with clinical data, as this approach can then be translated to a wide range of clinical problems.
Public engagement benefit
We will disseminate this information to the scientific community via peer-reviewed journals, but will also ensure that results are made available to the public who are interested in TB. In the UK, this will be via press releases with appropriate input from the University of Southampton press department and the Medical Research Council.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>235730</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/R001065/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>03BA7BC9-C251-48FC-8EA9-5F7414A63FEE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Infection</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>89AE580F-2437-4540-9640-37005C968E67</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>4.1  Discovery and preclinical testing of markers and technologies</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
