BC. The site has become internationally renowned due to the richness of the organic artefacts and ecofacts deposited on the edge of a lake and consequently preserved within peat for roughly 11,000 years. The importance of the site has recently been recognised by English Heritage, who are about to schedule the site as a National Monument. Star Carr was first discovered and excavated by local archaeologist John Moore in 1948, followed by three further seasons of excavation carried out by Grahame Clark of the University of Cambridge. The site produced 191 harpoons, 21 antler headdresses, elk antler mattocks, bone scrapers, awls and bodkins, a wooden paddle, amber and shale beads, as well as a large assemblage of faunal remains. In the 1980s further work was carried out revealing a timber platform or trackway, constructed of hewn planks, which is the earliest evidence of systematic carpentry in Europe. More recent excavations since 2004 have produced further important discoveries which rewrite our understanding of this period: another timber platform/trackway was discovered, evidence for the earliest hut structure in Britain was found and the size of the site and longevity of occupation suggests that people were settling into this landscape, as opposed to being highly mobile. However, there is a major problem: during recent excavations it has been discovered that the organic remains which made the site so important are severely deteriorating. The key findings are that: 1) In the waterlogged trench located next to Clark's trench (where abundant quantities of bone and antler were found in 1954) only 2 pieces of severely deteriorated bone were found, one of these being a 'jelly-bone', i.e. completely de-mineralised and mainly composed of gelatin; 2) All of the 25 fragments of antler found in the two recently excavated waterlogged trenches were extremely flattened and had become leathery; 3) Both the wood and the peat were extremely compressed and the wood has little to no cellulose surviving 4) The deposits in this field are highly acidic (&amp;lt; pH 3.0) and vulnerable to further increases in acidity and oxidisation. Wood of this period and in this abundance is unique to this site in the UK, and so far has provided tantalizing glimpses on early methods of wood-working, including hewing and splitting into planks. However, little is known about the platforms, glimpsed in two 2m wide trenches 25m apart: are these parts of one large platform? What was it used for? Is it a trackway running into the lake? How long was it used for? How does it relate to the artefacts deposited around it? How was it constructed? An understanding of these issues will not only answer important questions for hunter-gatherer archaeology in Europe, but will also contribute to key debates in later prehistory on the function of similar platforms and trackways and the use of wetlands in prehistory. Research demonstrates that the wood is no longer constantly waterlogged. Data from the MET office shows that rainfall totals across the UK have been lowest for over 40 years for the first five months of 2010. Such a lowering of the water table is predicted to have further disastrous consequences: i.e. conditions may have become optimal for aerobic decay and the wood will be rapidly digested by aerobic bacteria and fungi. The team believes that the now precariously fragile worked wood will not be amenable to further analysis beyond this year. Therefore, this research proposal aims to excavate areas of the timber platform before it is too late.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-06-24</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-07-25</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>51932</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A 2 year exhibition has been running at the Yorkshire Museum based on research from Star Carr</gtr:description><gtr:id>A0793A4A-A966-4D9C-AFD6-6A163B42B664</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Positive feedback from visitors to the museum</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>544ba111c89605.02953585</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:title>After The Ice exhibition at the Yorkshire Museum</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Mesolithic day School</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EDCF66CC-6E95-44CE-934A-9FDBD8C5D284</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Mesolithic day school (31st July): at Woodend Creative Space for Scarborough Museums Trust and Scarborough Archaeological and Historical Society.

BC. Due to their ephemeral nature, hunter-gatherer sites are rare, and Star Carr has become internationally renowned due to the richness of the remarkable organic artefacts and ecofacts deposited on the edge of a lake and subsequently preserved within peat: e.g. harpoons, antler headdresses, mattocks, a wooden paddle. More recent work in the 1980s revealed a timber platform or trackway leading out into the lake. This was constructed of hewn planks, and is the earliest evidence of systematic carpentry in Europe. Excavation in the waterlogged deposits in 2006/7 demonstrated that the peat is now seriously degraded, largely caused through recent drainage. This has resulted in unusually high acidity (&amp;lt;;3.0pH) and peat compression causing bone to become de-mineralised, antler to be flattened through degradation of core tissue, and loss of cellulose in the wood. Excavations funded by NERC in the summer of 2010 sought to discover more about the timber platforms, to recover further organic artefacts, to produce a detailed environmental context for human activity and to further assess the peat degradation in order to inform management policy for Star Carr as well as other wetland sites in Europe. The excavations revealed that the worked timber appeared to extend much further along the edge of the old lake shoreline than was previously thought with an extent of over 30 metres suggesting that this is perhaps not a trackway but some sort of lake edge platform. Unfortunately, as anticipated, the wood was extremely fragile which makes an assessment of wood working techniques extremely difficult. However, there are still more questions than answers and the nature of the platform/trackway is still not fully understood. In most of the trenches there was high acidity and consequently the organic remains had suffered. However, during the re-excavation of one of the original trenches, first dug in 1950, it was found that the back-fill of this trench had not become acidic. Some pieces of bone and antler from these original excavations had been thrown back into the trench and some parts of the trench had not been fully excavated. Because of this, three more rare harpoon points were discovered but the most significant find was a carved, wooden digging stick which, to our knowledge, is unique to the Mesolithic in Europe. A large number of specialists worked on various aspects of the environmental context, from insects to pollen to oxygen isotope analysis. This integration of techniques is resulting in a fine grained understanding of the build up deposits which can be related to climate and environmental change during human occupation. Further results will emerge following a programme of radiocarbon dating and Bayesian modelling (funded by English Heritage). Finally, the analysis of the deposits demonstrated that further degradation had taken place since the last excavations and by excavating the 1950s trench it is possible to demonstrate how much compression and decay has taken place over the 60 years. This research is continuing to inform other wetland sites of this period across Europe.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>They are informing similar studies in Europe through a network of researchers which forms the Stone Age Bog Group: in particular, degradation of deposits, cutting edge science, and public outreach.
