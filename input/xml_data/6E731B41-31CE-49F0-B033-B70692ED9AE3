&lt;p>In Experiment 1, 6-week old infants will participate in a session that will induce the walking reflex.&amp;nbsp; The looking behaviour of these infants to movies of walking and crawling biological motion will be compared with infants who have not experienced the walking reflex.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In Experiment 2, the same pretest phase will occur for half the sample with infants of the same age.&amp;nbsp; We will measure EEG brain activity in response to the two forms of biological motion.&amp;nbsp; It is predicted that differences in frontal and parietal regions will be evident, based on the experience of producing the walk reflex.&amp;nbsp; This work will address the following questions:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;ol>
 

 &lt;li>Does the experience of performing an action alter the perception of others in early development?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Is the processing of biological motion manifested in the human brain in very early development similar to responses seen in older infants?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Does the production of biological motion alter functional brain activity associated with the perception of biological motion?&lt;br />&lt;/li>

In the first (A), light is presented in the peripheral field of the fetus and held constant for a total of 45 seconds per trial. Trials consisting of different shapes are alternated and counterbalanced. In the second (B), light is presented using a procedure akin to the first. The light intensity is constantly varied within a trial. In these two designs, accumulated looking time towards the light is measured. In the final design (C), the light is presented in the peripheral field of the fetus and then moved away for approximately 7 seconds. This is repeated up to five times per shape presented. In response, the number of trials in which the fetus makes a head turn in order to track the light is measured. We have established that the human fetus will orient towards, and track shapes around the uterus that are presented through light. This work has therefore provided evidence of measurable behavioural responses in the late-term fetus using 4D ultrasound technology. Of the experiments designed, the largest response rate (allowing enough data for statistical analysis) was found in response to the methods presented in experiment B, followed by experiment C with the lowest response rate found in experiment A. 

In a study of fetal processing of number, sets of 2 and 3 dots of light were presented in an alternating manner continuously to the side of the fetus for a length of 45 seconds per trial (design B). Significantly more fetuses looked towards than away from the 2-dot set. There was no significant difference in looking towards and away from the 3-dot set. Therefore, this shows a differential response to different number sets. Using design C, three dots in the configuration of eyes and a mouth within a face, or, the same three dots inverted, were presented to the side of the fetus before being moved away for approximately 7 seconds. In this study, more fetuses followed the upright face-like stimuli then the inverted face-like stimuli. The procedure used to obtain this yielded a high attrition rate, therefore, additional data collection must be completed in order to statistically verify fetal capacities to process face-like stimuli. 

This project has established two new research networks and collaborations. The primary investigator is currently working with Dr Robert Young within the Physics department at Lancaster University to improve on the light source designed within this project so that more complex visual stimuli can be presented to the fetus through maternal tissue. An application for a patent for this light source has been submitted (New UK patent applicant number 1520076.9). Research collaboration has also been established with Dr Tim Donovan within the Medical Imaging Unit at Cumbria University. This collaboration will seek to increase data collection for the study of face-like processing as well as investigate other new research questions generated now that the kind of fetal behaviours that can be measured have been established.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This project has the possibility of opening up an entire new area of research, specifically by encouraging the use of developmental procedures and techniques to measure abilities found in newborn infants but with a fetal population. This generates the possibility of further understanding the origins of development, as well as the developmental trajectory, of abilities in the transition from late gestation to the beginnings of postnatal life. Follow up work is planned to be taken forward by Dr. Reid and Dr. Dunn as a consequence. 

The findings of this project have clearly been of great interest to the wider community, as determined by responses to local news coverage of the research. Projects of in this field can help families to understand more about how a late term fetus can respond to changes to light in the environment.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>652E3C98-11AD-4627-900D-09EDEE7D2588</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546d0eab8a22b4.79479324</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/babylab/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>89477F48-322B-4E33-9AFC-F60F7AD72A1D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Event-related potentials discriminate familiar and unusual goal outcomes in 5-month-olds and adults.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Developmental psychology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/0b309fec555adde28a87e34b41929317"><gtr:id>0b309fec555adde28a87e34b41929317</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Michel C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0012-1649</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5aa664661caa63.16766284</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>1A20F700-FA9A-4352-9F75-20C6083031E4</gtr:id><gtr:title>Links between action perception and action production in 10-week-old infants.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Neuropsychologia</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/01964776f741ee7b4661c75113364bc4"><gtr:id>01964776f741ee7b4661c75113364bc4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Reid VM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0028-3932</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5aa66465cbd585.32376230</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-000-22-3277</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/G028176/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
