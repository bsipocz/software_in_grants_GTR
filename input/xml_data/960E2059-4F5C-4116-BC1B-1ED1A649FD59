This research questions in how far China's official and dissident political forces are drawing on Christian values as new ideologies emerge in the post-socialist period.

Christian values are an increasingly accepted source of social moral and ethics in contemporary China. This study is the first to ask in detail what influence Christian values have had on social and political values in post-socialist China. It understands Christianity as an ideological source of social and political values (which may or may not stem from an individual's belief in and active practice of the Christian faith)which informs both official ideology and dissident ideology, albeit in different ways and to a different extent. This research argues that while we tend to think of China as an atheist, secular state, it is in fact vital to understand the importance religion plays in the state's response to emerging new values in society without giving ground in terms of a more democratic system. Instead of understanding the state (only) as repressor of religion, and the religious community as responsive to the state, my approach sees the process as mutual adaptation. 

This work stands apart from other research on Christianity in contemporary China by seeing official and non-official discourse as part of the same process and the same phenomenon. By placing great emphasis on textual analysis of Chinese official and non-official writings on Christianity this projects documents and analyses the ongoing discussions on the importance and utility of Christian values on a socio-political level in China today. Not only is it an important addition to the studies on post-socialist China, but it also presents a case study of translating cultures by aiding to our understanding of how Christianity has been 'translated' in the Chinese context.

The proposed project will result in the so far only single authored monograph on the interplay of politics and Christianity in contemporary China and is based on the following premises.

# Christianity is a not a foreign religion to China, but through the development of a Chinese theology and distinct local practices has become an integral part of Chinese cultural life.
# Christian belief is an ideology and a source of ethics as much as a faith expressed in religious practice, in the same way as Communism was as much a faith as a social theory upon which a state was built.
# Ideology remains an important element of Chinese politics.
# The Chinese government adapts its ideological basis in response to changing values in society in order to retain legitimacy and the widest possible support.
# Christian values, more than other religious values, play a key part in the development of a new ethics used to address China's social inequalities, both on an ideological and a practical level.

At the Nobel peace prize ceremony in Oslo in December 2012, Liu Xiaobo was represented by an empty chair. On an immediate level the symbol of the empty chair represented Liu's absence, but on a psychological level it also represented an estranged and distant China which was addressed by the hopes, wishes and determination of the world (as represented by the Noble Prize Committee). This research aims to make a contribution towards bringing together these two estranged partners in dialogue by documenting and analysing an existing dialogue (and sometimes confrontation) on values as it takes place in China today.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research challenges previously held assumptions about the nature and function of religious belief in China today. It shows the direct link between Christian belief and politically motivated civil society activity in China today. It also highlights the process by which ideology is adapted to new realities in contemporary China by showing how the Chinese government reacts and adapts to new emerging values in society without giving ground in terms of a more democratic system. All these findings in their own way have an impact on how policy makers outside China think about the role of religion, the role of civil society, the formation of ideology and the interaction between state and civil society in contemporary China. At the time of writing my research has already created interest in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Lambeth Palace, and the Home Office. The briefing paper published as part of this research will constitute a targeted tool to reach these interested parties.

The impact also reaches into the field of NGOs, and in particular faith based organisations working in China, which have contacted me over the past two years. Examples are Christian Solidarity Worldwide, Anglicans in World Mission, Beijing International Committee for Chinese Orphans. My research also impacts on human rights groups, in particular human rights lawyers, and I have already had enquiries from this corner (a London based Human Rights Law Practice). Individuals associated with such organisations have in the past contacted me to conduct interviews. This will continue and increase as a result of the journal articles (before the Fellowship Period), the briefing paper, the opinion piece, and ultimately the book publication. In addition, I expect this research to lead to discussions and workshops e.g. on the subject of religion and values, religion and rights in contemporary China.

I am regularly consulted by journalists working for national and international media. I expect this to increase as my research progresses, and in particular after the publication of the opinion piece which I am planning to publish in the last month of the Fellowship Period. 

This research does not intend to present China as a case study of Western theory, but will highlight how China deals with issues and concepts that are also of relevance in other countries. For example, China too speaks of &amp;quot;small government - big society&amp;quot;; how to change citizen's attitude towards the state and what ideals to build on in the search for a 'new society' is a question academics and politicians alike are pondering across the globe. Through the various outputs associated with this project will have an impact on this debate.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>59483</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited Workshop on East-West Spiritualities at the University of Aarhus</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>416D707C-B23D-478F-90A3-F657BD761DCA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was an invited workshop organised by tresearch network EASTSPIRIT, which seeks to investigate religious circulation between the East and the West as cultural processes of a contemporary, global world.

In a more general perspective, the aim is to 3) develop methods and theories to explore alternative models of transnational flows of religion in a global world.
