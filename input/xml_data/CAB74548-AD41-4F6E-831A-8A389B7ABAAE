Digital Innovations in Political Campaigning</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/N01667X/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The link between citizens and the state is the crux of democratic politics, yet it is crumbling. Numerous studies have diagnosed a crisis in representative politics with decreased participation and growing levels of distrust bringing the legitimacy of democratic institutions into doubt. For many a solution has been offered by digital technology, leading parties to embrace new digital campaigning software. To explore the capacity of digital innovations to renew democracy this study argues that we need to understand the nature of the 'disconnect' between parties and the people. 

As such, this study departs from traditional analyses of 'digital democracy' by focusing on public attitudes. Adapting the methodological approach used by Allen and Birch (2015) the project will discern how the public and parties conceive democratic linkage in practice and as an ideal, highlighting contradictions and convergence to diagnose the problem. Correlating these insights to the functions of digital software and theories of democratic linkage (Dalton, Farrell and McAllister, 2011) the capacity of digital innovations to renew party politics is considered.

To enable analysis 3 work packages (WP) are conducted.

WP1: How do parties perceive democratic linkage, and how have parties used digital management systems since 2010?
WP1 will first identify available forms of the type of digital innovation of interest to this project - namely 'digital management software' - and will categorise the functions they perform. Second, it will explore and develop theories of democratic linkage to provide a framework for subsequent analysis. Then, using interviews, internal party data and 3 case studies of constituency parties (1 from Labour, the Conservatives and Scottish National Party) the PI and RA will map perceptions of democratic linkage and usage of digital technology. This data will provide new insight on developments in party politics and will be used to produce case study accounts and articles that trace the form of change and consider the impact of digital technology on party organisation.

WP2: How do citizens perceive democratic linkage, and how does parties' use of digital management systems affect public attitudes?
Work package 2 explores the impact of new technology. Working with YouGov the PI will commission 2 surveys. The first will assess public attitudes towards parties', seeking to discern how the public want parties to engage and how they perceive this to work in practice. Data will be analysed to identify conceptions of democratic linkage (WP1) and then compared with party attitudes to identify synergies and incongruities in public and party conceptions. This analysis offers a diagnosis of the state of current linkage, and will identify areas of 'disconnect' to be further examined in WP3.

This WP will also probe public attitudes towards parties' use of digital campaigning techniques. Utilising a split sample survey, designed in collaboration with Dr Chris Jones, the PI will assess whether practices such as social media data mining are compatible with public notions of democratic linkage. This will inform an article, infographics and practitioner briefing papers. 

WP3: Can digital campaigning methods resolve the disconnect between citizens and the state?
In collaboration with the think tank Involve, the PI will use 3 deliberative events to explore parties' and citizens' attitudes towards democratic linkage and test the capacity of different forms of digital technology to reconcile these perceptions. Building on survey data these events will test attitudes; exploring whether sustained reflection affects how public and party desires are conceived (drawing on work by Stoker, Hay and Barr, forthcoming). Events will identify ideal forms of linkage - findings that will be used, returning to WP1, to consider the capacity of different forms of digital technology to promote linkage and hence renew party politics.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project is constructed to facilitate knowledge exchange and public debate. The PI's research to date has benefited from close working with practitioners in the Cabinet Office, the Irish Department for Public Expenditure and Reform, the Westminster Foundation for Democracy and Sheffield City Council that have enabled high quality, impactful research. The PI will build on this experience, working with the Labour Party, Conservative Party and Scottish National Party (SNP), the think tank Involve and with YouGov to provide the PI with access to established networks, expert oversight and training on new methodological approaches. This partnership is key to delivering tangible impact.

First, the PI will work closely with three UK political parties: Labour, the Conservatives and the SNP (see CfS for rationale). The PI has already secured access to the Labour Party and has gained support from Ian McNichol, Labour's General Secretary (see attached letter). Similar partnerships will be secured with the Conservatives and SNP during the project. These links will enable access and will be used to disseminate findings directly to those determining party strategy - a task for which David Blunkett will provide guidance. This project's interest in exploring unanticipated impacts of digital technology and the potential disconnection between public desires and party objectives will help inform parties' internal strategic development. The project will engage other institutions experiencing a 'disconnect' using a workshop in Parliament to discuss how to re-forge linkage. 

Second, the PI will work with YouGov, a leading polling company, to conduct public opinion surveys, and split survey response analyses designed to provide new insight on public attitudes towards parties and the impact of digital campaigning methods. Extended discussions have occurred with YouGov President, Peter Kellner, and YouGov staff to design the most appropriate methodological tools for this project. As part of this relationship, YouGov will work with the PI to provide methodological guidance on the design, implementation and analysis of surveys - equipping the PI with skills essential to her on going research in this area. In addition YouGov will also provide access to existing data archives (with appropriate data protection considerations), ensuring that this project does not duplicate existing work, but adds to understanding. This data will be used to stimulate public debate on the purpose of parties and the consequences of digital tools, with the PI producing infographics and exploring the possibility of a blog post for the YouGov website. 

Third, the PI has built close relationships with the think tank Involve; developing objectives in partnership with this organisation's focus on 'people and politics'. The partnership will see the PI work alongside experts in deliberative facilitation to execute three deliberative workshops. The data produced through this work will inform academic outputs and a report for Involve on the future of party politics. Social media resources and a blog will also be produced. These resources will be disseminated through Involve's extensive networks and will advance debate on the future of party politics and the desirability of different innovations - topics pertinent to an array of democratic bodies considering adopting these tools. 

Fourth, the PI has recruited a panel of mentors who will help to maximise the impact of this research. The combination of an internationally renowned academic, a retired cabinet minister and a leading pollster and journalist will provide guidance and contacts that the PI will use to connect with a range of different policy, media, academic and public audiences. Outputs pursued include national media appearances, an event in Parliament to disseminate project findings, and the production of infographics and social media posts.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>153391</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>70D638C6-5F6D-4DF5-A900-C38A14D22C7B</gtr:id><gtr:title>United Kingdom</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>European Journal of Political Research Political Data Yearbook</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/565f94c02bc020701fa5d5e78fa5527e"><gtr:id>565f94c02bc020701fa5d5e78fa5527e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>DOMMETT K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>59c24c3aeb2cc5.55680668</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N01667X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4A856E02-8C94-4981-B572-E381EEB60DD2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Media</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B64449A8-2468-4FB4-A7C4-D0D95891E5B9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Elections/Electoral studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>2968C870-0FF4-4AE9-A670-9B0161C83B37</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>New Media/Web-Based Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9FC0ED75-DE3F-405C-942B-631C356746EB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F7EEE6CD-E283-4BAB-BA5E-70B4B0F1F1A6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5BAFFA07-4055-4FE0-BE2D-FF47ECC4B6BF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Politics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
