The aim is to integrate two sophisticated but separate historiographical fields - centring on the Irish revolution and on Irish migration - to develop a more inclusive framework which will incorporate the diaspora and other external pressures into the mainstream narrative. The key methodology is provided by a transnational approach which will investigate how interactions across national boundaries shaped Ireland's revolution. By investigating the relationship between revolution in the nation-state, diasporic nationalism, and other external pressures during an era of rapid international change, this research will contribute to a wider understanding of nationalism as a global force.
The project comprises two interlocking research strands. The first focuses on the impact of transnational influences on the revolution within Ireland. The second is concerned with analysing the significance of Irish nationalism beyond Ireland. Both address the same overarching question: to what extent must revolutionary change be understood within a global, transnational as well as a nation-state framework?
The research context is framed by the dominance of nation-centred historiographical approaches, reflecting a widespread tendency to regard the nation-state as the natural unit of analysis. Although gaining ground elsewhere, transnational approaches have had little impact on Irish historiography despite the importance of external factors on Ireland. For example, despite acknowledging the impact of Irish America on Irish politics, histories of Irish nationalism such as Richard English's influential Irish Freedom (2003) largely overlook diasporic influences. Similarly, studies of diasporic nationalism rarely analyse its impact on Ireland. As a result, key themes are often debated in insular terms. For example, nation-centred analyses of the Irish revolution can result in the imposition of arbitrary geographical boundaries and neglect of comparative dimensions and external pressures. Local studies, the dominant approach since the ground-breaking research of David Fitzpatrick (1977), provide a sophisticated anatomy of the revolution's impact on Irish society but a limited means of assessing the significance of factors which transcend the nation-state. They shed little light on how the destabilising impact of the First World War, the emergence of self-determination as the principal source of political legitimacy, and the establishment of new republics across Europe heightened political expectations in Ireland. 
There is therefore a compelling rationale for looking to Ireland as a case study of the global character of nationalism. As a small country with a large diaspora, forming part of a multinational state and global empire, Ireland was highly susceptible to transnational influences. The well-documented nature of the Irish revolution, its small scale, and the sophistication of the literature on Irish nationalism and the Irish diaspora also point to its potential as a broader case study.
This approach will also contribute to wider British historiography. Although British historians generally emphasise how the UK avoided the First World War's destabilising fallout, the parallels between experiences in the Irish part of the British state and central/eastern Europe where imperial power gave way to democratisation, self-determination and ethnic nationalism are evident. A wider framework will allow for comparative analysis across the 'shatter zones' of empire (Wilson, 2010). Ultimately, our project aims to demonstrate how revolutions represent much broader political moments in global history, without losing sight of the distinctive aspects of national histories. More radically, it will question the assumption - implicit in most historians' work - that nation-centred models provide the best means of understanding the causes of political change.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit? 
- (Irish) Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT)
- National Museums Northern Ireland (NMNI) and National Museum of Ireland (NMI)
- Century Ireland
- History Ireland
- the Irish, Northern Irish and UK governments

How will they benefit?
Our project will assist the DFAT in its objective of interpreting the Irish revolution in an international context. Our collaboration with NMNI and NMI will provide both institutions with our historical expertise. It will provide Century Ireland and History Ireland with scholarly research. We will also support the Irish/N.I/UK government's commemorative programmes of historical reflection. For example, by interpreting partition within a European context, our project will enhance understanding of the most sensitive anniversary of the Decade. 

What will be done to ensure they benefit? 
With the support of the DFAT, our project will develop a portable ten-panel exhibition on the Irish revolution's global dimensions to be offered to Irish embassies across the world. The CI has worked closely with the DFAT to commemorate the 1916 Rising (see http://www.ed.ac.uk/history-classics-archaeology/news-events/news/easter-rising).

We will collaborate with the leading museums in Ireland/N.I. in developing their major exhibitions at the Ulster Museum and Collins Barracks. William Blair, Head of Human History, has welcomed our proposal to work on the Ulster Museum's Partition exhibition: 'The research would stream directly into the development of the exhibition and related programming. The scope of your research would fit perfectly.' As a member of advisory bodies for the Ulster Museum and National Museum's 1916 exhibitions, the PI has close links with both institutions. 

We will partner with History Ireland (http://www.historyireland.com/) to produce a publication on the Irish revolution. HI has an international readership, with a 'hard sales' circulation of 5,000 per issue, while its 1916 publication sold c. 10,000 copies. Our publication will be supported by a podcasted Hedge School (http://www.historyireland.com/hedge-schools/). The PI has previously participated in Hedge Schools, and guest-edited a special issue on Fenianism.
We will work with Boston College/RTE to provide content for its online historical newspaper Century Ireland (http://www.rte.ie/centuryireland/). Web-Traffic DATA?

Our project will exploit public engagement opportunities arising as a result of the 2012-2022 Decade of Centenaries (http://www.decadeofcentenaries.com/). Our project meets a key objective of the Advisory Group on Centenary Commemorations: 'The commemorative programme should illustrate how events in Ireland were . . . part of the wider international story. A comprehensive commemorative programme should not only address the key events in Ireland but also enhance the understanding of the wider United Kingdom, European and world context in which they took place' (http://www.decadeofcentenaries.com/statement/).

* We will build on existing public engagement networks at QUB, including the AHRC-funded Living Legacies Centre (http://www.livinglegacies1914-18.ac.uk/), the AHRC-funded Commemoration of Partition and Civil Wars in Ireland 2020-23 project, and the Universities Ireland historians' committee (of which the PI is a founding member) (http://universitiesireland.ie/category/conferences/). In addition, due to his work on the 1916 centenary, the PI has links with a wide range of bodies responsible for commemorative activity (see Pathways to Impact for further details).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>556580</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/P00914X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>319D6F57-4306-40E8-9F0A-84D514AAF7FC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Imperial/Colonial History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3CE20DB9-873E-489F-BBC7-3F05BD0D900C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
