Wigner 1960 Comm. Pure and Appl. Math. 13:1] has faced growing challenges as mathematicians have turned high performance computers towards understanding the world around us. Weather, financial markets, the human brain, each are made up of simple parts, but their interesting behaviour arises because of the way those parts interact. Highly complex behaviour then emerges. We even call these &amp;quot;complex'' systems, suggesting that complexity in their description is unavoidable, and ever higher demands are placed on computers to model them. Leave your computers at the door! This Fellowship will seek simple explanations for complex behaviour in the fundamentals of interaction itself. 

A famous example of complex behaviour arising from simple laws is chaos, which explains why the weather is unpredictable despite deterministic underlying equations. Another example is a canard explosion, a rapid cascade of dynamics that occurs too abruptly to observe (the term &amp;quot;canard'' alludes to an old French joke, portraying Nature as a trickster selling a mathematician &amp;quot;un canard a moitie&amp;quot;, or half a duck). A problem arises because these phenomena, highly important to everyday life, often depend on infinitesimally small quantities that are difficult or impossible to calculate. 
This Fellowship aims to find universal laws linking these small quantities to the nature of interaction.

Small quantities can, counterintuitively, rise to dominate a system when an interaction occurs between systems with differing internal time scales, like a fast switch in a slowly changing electric current. 
When the mismatch between interacting timescales is extreme, sudden jumps can occur between different dynamical regimes. We can approximate the jump by a sharp discontinuity (a true jump in the mathematical sense), and studying the shape or configuration of the system near the discontinuity. This approach has explained why slipping objects suffer episodes of sticking, and how impacts lead to chattering. More surprisingly, it has recently led to a new description of canards, and a new non-deterministic form of chaos. These previously unknown phenomena are so violent that, if seen in experiments, one is unlikely to have conceived of them having such simple mathematical origins.

So the theory based on discontinuities predicts qualitatively new phenomena, but it cannot quantify them exactly. The objective of the Fellowship is to bring together the geometrical theory unhindered by small quantities, and the small quantity theory capable of exact calculations. This will give a rigorous explanation for the newly discovered discontinuity-induced phenomena, and provide much simpler geometry based methods to calculate emergent phenomena in complex systems. The simpler these are to calculate, the more effective they are to study real world problems in engineering and medicine. As examples we will study models of neuron signaling in the brain, and electronic switches in power systems.

The missing ingredient is how to tie discontinuity geometry to small quantities which are already hard to calculate. For this we will borrow methods for calculating small quantities from wave physics. We study the dynamics in `complex time' and seek stationary solutions. This is an abstract but naturally geometric approach, and has not been applied to discontinuity-induced phenomena before.

Wigner said of the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics, &amp;quot;we should be grateful for it and hope that it will remain valid in future research&amp;quot;. There is no doubt that systems with many parts can produce complicated dynamics, but the effectiveness of mathematics comes from finding behaviours that are simple and robust, and the Fellowship aims to study these in the mathematics describing interactions, as a crucial step towards the ultimate goal of understanding the full intricacy that complex systems can produce.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The results of the Fellowship will directly benefit applied mathematicians who model discontinuous systems from engineering and neuroscience, and through them will benefit wider society by facilitating better design in industry and medicine. A specific example involves my collaboration with Steve Shaw (Michigan State University) who currently runs two research programmes that will benefit from the early stages of the Fellowship. The first of these is modeling of the superconducting stripline resonator for which we are now able to explain changes in stability, and with further work will be able to extend our study to describe precisely the resonator's experimental behaviour. This then benefits the experimental inventors of the resonator device, Buks and Shtempluck (Israel), who use it to measure various physical phenomena such as quantum effects in metals, whose work has further indirect benefits in high technology design, particularly in computing. The second of Shaw's programmes is an experimental study of impacts and friction in centrifugal vibration absorbers, devices which are used in the aeronautic and automobile industries to provide more efficient power transfer in engines. The results of the Fellowship directly allow Shaw's group to obtain a greater understanding of their experimental system, the beneficiaries of which are the sponsors of that work which include the automobile manufacturer Chrysler. 

Other currently identified beneficiaries are for the most part indirect. The research into neuron models derived from the Hodgkin-Huxley model will directly improve capabilities for simulating neuron spiking, which is carried out by collaborators in Sydney and Cornell. This in turn benefits experimentalists at universities and drug companies investigating occurrence and treatment of epileptic seizures, Parkinson's disease, and heart arrhythmia, with obvious benefits for sufferers of these diseases worldwide. Parkinson's, for example, affects around 120 000 people in the UK with another 10 000 diagnosed each year according to the Parkinson's Disease Society which spends around &amp;pound;4million on research into treatments each year, while epilepsy is even worse with an estimated 456 000 sufferers in the UK and 50 million worldwide according to the National Society for Epilepsy. An established treatment where this research has direct application is deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's. These are long term beneficiaries over a scale of several years. The mathematics provided by the Proposal will stimulate new models, and new computer techniques, within the applied mathematics community. Through communication with experimental researchers these promise technological developments that will benefit medical science in the coming decades. 

Scientific beneficiaries include applied mathematicians working in piecewise-smooth dynamical systems, control theory, and singular perturbation theory. Benefits include not only knowledge gained from the research itself, but new connections made between scientists in these areas and experimental science. Bristol has established in important role in creating these connections, and in the past year I have brought together previously unconnected mathematicians from the UK, Portland State USA, the Netherlands, Spain, South America and Sydney. Under the Fellowship these links will be strengthened and new connections made between myself and other researchers worldwide. There are many different approaches and expertise being used to address to the existing problems in nonsmooth dynamics, and the greatest progress will be made by discussions and collaboration between the different studies. Results of the Fellowship will be published in high ranking international journals, and where appropriate these will be publicized to the wider scientific community through review papers in journals of a broader scope, and by presentation at multidisciplinary conferences.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder
