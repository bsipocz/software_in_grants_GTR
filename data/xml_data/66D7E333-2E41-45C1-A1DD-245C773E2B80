One method, known as direct liquid cooling (DLC), is to drive liquid coolant directly through a chip via microscopic channels. However, since these channels are necessarily very narrow, the required driving pressure difference can be impractically large. One way to overcome this is to reduce the frictional forces exerted by the channel walls on the coolant. Very recently it has been proposed to do this by using microchannels lined with what are known as superhydrophobic surfaces (SS's).

SS's are surfaces textured with microscopic structures which can reduce the frictional drag forces on liquids flowing over them. Essentially, cavities between the structures trap pockets of air over which the liquid flows more freely than it does over a solid substrate. Such surfaces occur commonly in nature, a well-known example being the lotus leaf. The potential for using biomimetic SS's in a wide variety of applications has been known for some time, but it is only recently that advances in microfabrication technology have made it possible for them to be manufactured. This has led to a surge in interest in them. However, in the context of DLC, whilst SS's lubricate the flow of the coolant, little is known about how they influence the flow of heat, which is the primary concern. This currently makes designing DLC devices with SS's a difficult task. What are of most use to engineers doing this, are formulae which reveal the exact (or close to exact) dependence of the flow of liquid and heat on the design parameters (e.g., the spacing of the microstructures). Such formulae make it possible to pinpoint the values of these parameters which optimise cooling much faster than, say, by numerical computations. The primary aim of this project is to find such formulae.

In terms of exact solutions, the benchmark results in the field are those derived by Philip. Our first aim is to derive an extension of these results. We shall do this by using similar techniques to those applied by Philip, but with the important addition of a new set of mathematical tools arising from recently-identified, so-called secondary Schottky groups. The use of similar tools has proved to be highly effective at finding exact solutions to similar problems over the last decade.

However, one limitation of Philip's results, and almost all others which have followed in the literature, is that they assume the shape of the interface, or meniscus, between the trapped pockets of air and the liquid to be flat. In reality this meniscus is generally curved, and at these microscopic scales, this curvature can have a significant effect. Our second aim is to derive solutions which account for a full range of this curvature. The construction of such solutions in terms of explicit formulae would be very hard using the tools applied in the case of flat menisci or other, traditional methods. To overcome this we shall make use of a powerful new technique, based on so-called transforms, which is specifically designed for solving problems of this type involving curved boundaries.

The multiple facets of this proposal (modelling flows of both liquid and heat involving solid/liquid/gas interfaces and curvature effects), and the complexity and power of the tools to be applied (secondary Schottky groups, the new transform method), make this a mathematically rich project. In addition, the innovative application of SS's to DLC, and the current interest in SS's as a whole, combined with the novelty of the proposed mathematical techniques, make these investigations of timely significance. Furthermore, given that a number of other entirely different physical processes are governed by the same mathematical equations, the project's results will have a broad impact.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Direct liquid cooling is a potential solution to the problem of cooling next-generation microprocessor chips. The successful incorporation of superhydrophobic surfaces into this cooling technique would make it an even more effective and viable option. However, before this is possible, determining the precise effect on flows over superhydrophobic surfaces of the associated meniscus curvature, as well as how these surfaces influence heat transfer, are key questions that must be answered. By addressing these issues, the results of this project will benefit engineers (in both academia and industry) involved in the development of such microelectronics cooling devices. This impact may be expected to be felt within the lifetime of the project or at least shortly thereafter, and will take the form of transferred knowledge. In the long-term, whilst the utimate realisation of such devices remains some way off, if successful, their impact would be extremely significant; enabling the development of microchips with faster processing speeds would be of enormous economic and societal value. 

Aside from microelectronics cooling, the results of this project may be expected to have a similar impact on many of the other numerous technological applications anticipated for superhydrophobic surfaces which are currently driving research in this field at such a pace. Examples of these include enhanced microfluidic mixing and diffusion-osmotic pumping, drag reduction on marine vessels, and also the promotion of drop-wise vapour condensation for the improved efficiency of power plants.

Furthermore, beyond the realms of superhydrophobic surfaces, the impact of these results is also likely to be felt in a number of entirely different physical contexts where similar mathematical problems arise. These include electrical and heat conduction in composite materials, fluid flows through meshes and porous media, and the trapping of diffusing particles, all of which have industrial and technological applications.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>74037</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The research funded by this grant has led to three papers, one of which has been published and the other two of which are currently under review, together with a fourth paper that is still in preparation. The published paper presents results for the so-called ``escape problem'' in a disc with an arbitrary distribution of exit windows along its boundary circle. Mathematically, this is precisely the same problem as a flow through a circular tube lined with a superhydrophobic (i.e. friction-reducing) surface. Flows over such surfaces were the main focus of the original proposal. Such escape problems arise, for example, in the modelling of biological processes, such as the diffusion of a molecule inside a cell until it is absorbed by a target binding site along the cell wall. Our results describe how long one can expect a particle to take to escape from the disc, and through which window it is most likely to make its exit. These results are in the form of exact formulae that may be easily computed. Previously, such results had been limited to restricted distributions of exit windows or computed by less efficient, purely numerical means. 

The other two papers present results for flows over superhydrophobic surfaces. The first of these is for flow over a single superhydrophobic wall, allowing for arbitrary protrusion of the menisci of the gas bubbles trapped in the wall's grooves (it is these bubbles that reduce the friction on the liquid flowing over the surface), and arbitrary widths of the grooves. In particular, we computed the slip length of this flow (a measure of the corresponding reduction in friction). Previous means of computing this slip length were either purely numerical, or limited to restricted ranges of the menisci protrusion and/or groove widths. Our approach, however, rests on a novel hybrid analytical-numerical method, that appears to be more efficient for computations (than a purely numerical approach), and has no such limitations.

The third paper presents results for flow through a channel, both of whose walls are superhydrophobic, allowing for flat or slightly protruding menisci of the trapped gas bubbles and arbitrary widths of the walls' grooves. In particular, we derived an exact formula for the corresponding slip length that may be easily computed. Previously, except in special cases, this slip length had only been computed by less efficient, purely numerical means.

The fourth paper will present results on contact resistance to heat transfer in composites of materials of different thermal conductivities. Mathematically, this problem is similar to those already mentioned.

The grant also helped the PI to develop his skills as a supervisor, by his supervision of the funded Research Associate. It also helped to further the academic development of this Research Associate. The grant also helped to strengthen ties between the PI and Prof. Hodes group from the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Tufts University (one of Prof. Hodes' students is a co-author of one of the aforementioned papers).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We envisage the results presented in the aforementioned two papers relating to flows of liquids over superhydrophobic surfaces, being used to derive results for heat transfer via such surfaces, as outlined in the original proposal in the context of microelectronics cooling.
