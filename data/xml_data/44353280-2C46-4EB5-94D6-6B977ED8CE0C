It seeks to develop a conceptual framework through which the claims of important international actors (such as judges in international courts, organs of international organisations such as the United Nations Security Council or the Human Rights Committee, and the foreign ministries of States) justify the authoritative nature of their views. It is simultaneously a study of competing discourses and how specific views come to be accepted as authoritative, as well as a study on the nature of international law itself.

To date, international legal scholars tend to focus on the validity of law: has a norm/rule become binding through accepted processes? Is there or is there not an obligation to do something, or a right to see that something be done or not be done? These are certainly valid questions: but they obscure the question of whom is making these claims, how these claims are constructed, and to whom claims are directed. These important questions are crucial in understanding how international law is developed, why certain actors enjoy heightened authority, and why projects of reform and resistance, such as the 'New International Economic Order', or even the recasting of sovereignty as responsibility in the ongoing debate on the 'Responsibility to Protect', have so often failed against dominant accounts of the role of law in international relations.

In this respect, the project seeks to explore a number of points. First, is there something particular to the international legal form itself that confines and structures the ability for actors to make claims. Does the legal form oblige actors to use the language of rights, obligations and responsibilities? What are the consequences of being obliged to formulate claims in such language? To which audiences are such claims directed?

Secondly, the project will study the question as to whether the international legal system is a closed system, one where certain officials are entrusted to safeguard its order and coherence above all. The possible 'officials' in question would include: international organisations, who exercise powers and make decisions on the basis of powers delegated by States; international judges, who make decisions and enforce certain categories of rules or norms upon the conferral of such powers on them by States or international organisations; and other international decision-makers who regularly give their opinions on matters falling with their competence. The study seeks to explore both the means through which these varying groups claim authority, so as to discern whether international law has some sort of unified approach to authority, or whether the different methods and strategies used by such actors are indicative of the particular form of international law.

Thirdly, the project seeks to consider how other actors, who are not necessarily 'officials' within the system, construct and structure claims within international law, and the extent to which these are confined and limited by the authority wielded by legal officials, or indeed, by the form of international law itself. Such actors include, but are not limited, to individuals, corporations, activists and NGOs pursuing social or political change, This strand will explore the extent to which law serves to structure and/or limit their claims, whether such actors have abandoned the use of legal techniques to advance their claims, and what, if any, emancipatory potential there remains in deploying legal arguments. Two case studies will be conducted within this strand: a study of how discourses on economic development take place within international law, and a study on the use of law by activists or advocates as a technique through which to formulate claims for social change on the international level, specifically with regard to human rights, redistribution of resources, and the protection of the environment.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The immediate beneficiaries of this research are a broad swathe of international legal practitioners who occupy a number of functions. Understanding of strategies of authority within the law can only help in their daily work: 1) policy-makers, often employed by government ministries, who engage with international law and seek to identify where authority lies; 2) legal advisers and counsellors to States, corporate actors and individual actors who seek to enforce or deny a legal claim; 3) activists and members of the 'third sector', who seek to pursue social and/or political change through their work, whether by constituting non-governmental organisations or acting in small groups; 4) the category of low and middle-income sovereign States who have but limited access to elite legal counsel, who must seek to understand how strategy and persuasion are effective in international fora, and whose claims are so often marginalised and ignored because they are not formulated in accordance with the accepted canons of authority. 

The main benefit to all relevant stakeholders would be a better understanding of how claims of legal authority are constructed, and how their wider claims for political, social and cultural change can be formulated with a greater understanding of how the law shapes and constrains their political choices, and with an increased awareness of the techniques and strategies of resistance. This further understanding would allow them deploy such techniques and strategies in formulating their own political claims cogently and in a manner that can persuade decision-makers. 

For policy-makers and legal advisers to States, corporate actors and individual actors, it is hoped that the investigator's ability to frame the debate in more conceptual terms would make such actors gain heightened awareness of the authority wielded through legal argument, and that they would embrace the need for significant changes to current discourses of law and authority. Currently, law and authority are viewed as immutable forms, based in the orthodox concept of international law as treaties (written obligations of States), custom (unwritten practice of States), and general principles (internal practices of States). By systematising the normative influence of other actors and the heightened authority they in fact wield, it is hoped to inform both their practice on a daily basis and to illuminate that a new approach, better approximating reality, is required with respect to the sources of international law.

For activists and members of the third sector, their advocacy strategies would evolve so as to encompass a more nuanced understanding of the legitimating and constraining nature of the legal form. They would be able to deploy the structures mapped out in this project and refine their strategies in order to persuade decision-makers more effectively. By illuminating how the international legal system privileges certain understandings of law and thus certain unequal power relations, this project will hopefully equip them with the rhetorical and strategic tools that they can deploy to argue in favour of legal evolution or even change on the international plane.
 
For these reasons, the dissemination plans include the major contribution of non-academic stakeholders from all of these areas to the edited collection (see 'Dissemination' title in the Case for Support), so as to allow them to participate and provide insights throughout the design and execution of the project. The edited collection will be supported by a project website on www.globalpolicyjournal.com, which will disseminate the results of the research to a wide audience, and by a downloadable summary research briefing (c. 6000 words) expressly targeting a non-specialised audience, and translating this research into a form that would potentially influence current debate on the authority of law on the international plane.
