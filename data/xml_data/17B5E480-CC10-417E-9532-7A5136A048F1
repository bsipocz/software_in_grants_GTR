environments to make mobility easy, enjoyable and meaningful for older people</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/K037404/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Recent research shows that remaining active is a vital component in healthy ageing and that exercise provides protection against mental decline in old age. People are more mobile if they live in an appropriate environment, one that is safe, accessible and has good services. To date, much guidance has focused on overcoming barriers in the environment, such as steps without handrails or poor quality lighting. Removing such barriers is important but this approach alone will not encourage people to be more active. We need to understand the positive qualities that encourage people to go out, remain mobile, and give them pleasure into very old age. Our proposal builds on growing evidence that mood and emotion influence people's willingness to be active, which is in turn influenced by the experience of different environments - the 'mood' of one place versus another.

Places need to be attractive, in order to support positive moods, and to draw people into them. Some places offer peace and quiet, others offer sociability, excitement or a sense of fun. The environment needs to offer different opportunities according to how people feel at the time. Well-designed places don't automatically put people in a good mood, but we think places that match the emotional needs of the moment contribute to a self-reinforcing virtuous cycle. If the mood of a place is right then people will get out and about, feel better, take better care of their environment, and think of their environment more positively.

Positive emotions broaden people's awareness and encourage them to think and act in novel ways, and to be more curious and exploratory, both mentally and physically. Environments that encourage positive moods affect how competent people are at carrying out everyday tasks, such as preparing meals, going to the shops or planning an outing. People who feel competent are more likely to focus on the positive, to feel well, to make healthy choices, and to be more mobile.

We will draw on our studies of the patterns, causes, and effects of health conditions among groups of people (epidemiology), combined with techniques in neuroscience involving brain imaging. We will also work in equal partnership with older people, including stroke survivors and people with dementia, to design together better environments. This innovative combination of approaches will help us to deliver new ideas about the design of places that support positive emotions, reduce anxiety, and encourage people to be more active and mobile, long into old age. Well-designed and maintained environments should make mobility an easy, enjoyable and meaningful choice.

Our research is structured around four Work Packages involving: (1) designing together with older people, (2) examining data from recordings of neural signals (EEG) while people are moving through different environments, (3) studying information from a large group of older people born in the 1920s and 30s, to understand patterns of environment, activity and health over their life course, and (4) working with partners to evaluate and share our results and develop illustrated, user-friendly guidance on how to provide better environments in future.

Our team of researchers has expertise in environment, health, wellbeing, social policy and collaborative design, with an excellent track record of past Research Council and other major grants. We have experience in providing design guidance for the built environment, innovative approaches to measuring people's responses to their environment, working with them to understand their preferences, and analysing the implications of results. We also have experience in mapping important aspects of the environment.

To maximise the impact of our research, we will mobilise our ongoing partnerships with policy-makers at national and local government level, with professional bodies, and with third sector organisations supporting older people and age-friendly environmental design.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research?

For the successful application of our research findings to everyday challenges and opportunities, we will take a cross-cutting approach to the types of stakeholders we engage with and to the ways in which we engage with them. The research beneficiaries will be:

- Local, central and European government, including elected members and officials; Thinktanks and non-departmental public bodies.
- Public sector practitioners in health, housing and social care; Professional organisations spanning these sectors.
- Private sector practitioners in planning, urban design, product design, architecture, landscape architecture, transport consultancy and highways engineering; Professional member organisations spanning these sectors; Mobility and telecare industry.
- Not-for-profit organisations and charities spanning sectors outlined above, plus those dedicated to older people's issues; Older people, their families and carers. 
- Academic networks promoting interdisciplinary work in sectors outlined above.

How will they benefit from this research?

Mobility, Mood and Place is rooted in co-creative principles, with projected outputs tailored to the advancement, not only of academic expertise but also of the UK's wider knowledge base, its society, people and economy. As an interdisciplinary team, we have excellent existing connections within different spheres of influence and sectors and will achieve maximum socio-economic impact by strengthening the networks between them.

We have a clear perspective on where ageing and mobility issues sit within the focus of the four UK governments, with whom we have established good contacts. Our team has input into health, quality of life and social inclusion strategies at the critical early stages, including the new Five Year Ageing Well programme in Wales, which will evolve as our project does. By the end of Mobility, Mood and Place we will have produced a series of policy papers. They will offer sustainable, long-term options to those tasked with reducing health inequalities among older populations.

We have strong links with Local Government bodies and various individual councils and health boards. Liaising with them will assist in identifying live research sites and facilitate direct engagement with older stakeholders for research recruitment and communication. We will include design principles and exemplars among our outputs, developed collaboratively by trainee/early career designers, researchers and older people. This will enhance designers' skills before they enter professional practice and refine a model for workshops to be more widely used in architectural education.

We know that age-friendly services can give manufacturers a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Through business-led position papers based on academic evidence, we will provide feedback to industry from an older population with an increasing economic profile and influence. Our work will aid understanding of underlying reasons for different physical behaviours and emotional responses to place, and therefore how people might respond to different interventions in the built environment. We will facilitate training events that bring together professional organisations, so that each develops an understanding of how the others assess, interpret and meet user needs.

Many older people are themselves active in lobbying for more age-friendly design. We aim to better enable them to do so, e.g. through social networking. To reach those who are not technologically enabled, as well as other user groups, we will secure the partnership of charities and not-for-profit organisations. We will work with stakeholders to promote the positive effects of care home residents remaining active in the community and to assist care providers in making more informed choices with respect to the mobility of older service users, including the significant proportion (~50%) with some form of dementia.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1273656</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Exhibition of three years of the work of MMP, including information on the research design, methodologies and early findings.

&amp;quot;It's always a good sign when they have to put out extra chairs,&amp;quot; said Ian Deary, after his talk on 16th February to Penicuik's branch of the University of the Third Age. &amp;quot;They said they usually get 30-50 people, but I lost count after 60. It's great to see such enthusiasm for hearing about healthy cognitive ageing and the Lothian Birth Cohorts' contribution to that. I encouraged people in the audience to ask any questions as we went along, and they were good at that. However, there were lots more excellent questions and discussions at the end of the talk. They wanted to know the evidence about many things, including genetics, dementia, physical exercise, smoking, sleep and cognitive engagement. I was especially pleased, when I was having my tea and custard cream afterwards, when an audience member congratulated my team on demonstrating reverse causation for some potential factors in cognitive ageing!&amp;quot; We note that Ian cycled to and from Penicuik to give the talk, which we hope contributed a little towards keeping him sharp.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c113ff9798e1.06403619</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ccace.ed.ac.uk/node/342</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Mobility Mood &amp; Place Plenary Presentation - Designing Age Friendly Environments</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>59CF61D1-3EEF-408C-944B-CB8C92A296BB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Plenary Presentation at the Mobility Mood and Place Conference with Professor Catharine Ward Thompson.

The event was for an invite-only audience of around 150 higher level strategic professionals and decision makers and reached capacity. Most of the materials we exhibited were related to our work on ageing, including Mobility, Mood and Place and Inclusive Design for Getting Outdoors. The A-Z of Co-Design proved particularly popular with visitors to our stand, as many were seeking ways to work more collaboratively with partners and communities. Therefore, even if our research questions were not of particular relevance to them, our methods were. For example, the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, who are currently looking at ways to make the service more inclusive. A number of the following asked for business cards so that they could get in touch to arrange a longer / more targeted meeting: Alison Clyde (Generations Working Together); Anne Connor (Outside the Box); Heather Edwards (Care Inspectorate); Karen Windle (University of Stirling); Peggy Winford (Scottish Government); Scott Neill (City of Edinburgh Council).</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>57d013d5b11fa1.94271527</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Third sector organisations</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.voluntarysectorgateway.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/National-Summit-on-Loneliness-and-Social-Isolation.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>For Later Life Conference 2017</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D4C3A262-72A7-4EA6-B4CD-4F8B35DFFDDE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>At the invitation of AgeUK, the Mobility, Mood and Place (MMP) team was invited to exhibit at the organisation's annual conference in London, which brings together around 300 stakeholders to share tools and ideas on how we can create a culture of wellbeing in later life.

Free copies of the wallchart were available to delegates, as were printed copies of our open access papers. Dr Katherine Brookfield and Iain Scott attended on behalf of MMP. As well as making new connections and sharing resources with research users, the event was a chance to further strengthen our links with Age UK.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58c03dd819fd89.90259022</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Third sector organisations</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ageuk.org.uk/professional-resources-home/conferences/forlaterlife/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>22.5.15 'Housing developments in the UK', Age Care seminar, Adelaide, Australia</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>27406DE9-1A95-4C06-977E-2998FA6DF11F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A general discussion about housing developments in the UK which included a discussion on Mobility Mood and Place.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58b40bb052bec1.18332361</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Co-Design Workshops with Older members of the public in Orkney Islands, UK</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EE1C0501-727B-4DA8-8B0B-51F8D860E869</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Co-design and Research workshops in Kirkwall, Orkney Islands UK, with older people participants and undergraduate and postgraduate students of Architecture and Landscape Architecture, leading to exhibition of designs for age friendly environments at degree show, Edinburgh College of Art.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56d03c9c1db400.03649098</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Healthy cognitive ageing and the Lothian Birth Cohorts of 1921 and 1936 - Ian Deary</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6267FE08-5521-44E0-BBA1-DBB0A9FF195D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Deary, I.

Convened by Claire Sugden MLA, the Chair of the Northern Ireland Assembly's All-Party Group on Ageing and Older People, it took the form of keynote presentations by politicians, senior civil servants and senior representatives of third sector organisations, followed by questions and comments from the floor. 

For us, as well as hearing about policy and practice in Northern Ireland (and how it differs from the rest of the UK), it was a chance to reconnect with one of the keynote speakers, Roger O'Sullivan; formerly of CARDI, now Director of the Ageing Research &amp;amp; Development Division at The It was also an opportunity to introduce the second keynote speaker, Chris Matthews (Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety) to our work.

BBC1 are planning a series in the Spring called 'Holding back the years'. Each programme will feature a celebrity revisiting a place that means a lot to them, and the programmes will have a focus on the processes of human ageing. Mr Turnbull was at the University of Edinburgh in the 1970's (he shared a flat with Gordon Brown for a term!), and so his programme is based here. It was natural that, to find out more about ageing, and with an Edinburgh locus, he and the BBC filming team visited the LBC1936. A busy afternoon's filming was filled with his interviewing LBC1936 Director Ian Deary, speaking with about a dozen of the LBC1936 participants, and seeing and taking part in some cognitive testing.

The WHO European Region report on 'Urban Green Space and Health' (2016) cites research papers from our work on links between green space and health, particularly related to mobile EEG measures of neural activity. &amp;quot;This report summarizes the available evidence of beneficial effects of urban green spaces, such as improved mental health, reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, obesity and risk of type 2 diabetes, and improved pregnancy outcomes. Mechanisms leading to these health benefits include psychological relaxation and stress alleviation, increased physical activity, reduced exposure to air pollutants, noise and excess heat. Characteristics of urban green spaces that are associated with specific mechanisms leading to health benefits, and measures or indicators of green space availability, accessibility and use that have been used in previous surveys are discussed from the perspective of their public health relevance and applicability for monitoring progress towards goals set in international commitments, such as the Parma Declaration in the WHO European Region and the global Sustainable Development Goals.&amp;quot;

The WHO Europe web page that introduces the report mentions the following, in which the Report is expected to play a role: Upcoming Ministerial Conference on Environment and Health. Urban green space relates directly to the priority theme of the Sixth Ministerial Conference on Environment and Health - &amp;quot;Cities&amp;quot;. The Conference, to be held on 13-15 June 2017 in Ostrava, Czechia, will bring together health and environment ministers and high-level representatives of WHO European Region Member States, partner organizations, academia and civil society. Member States are expected to adopt a ministerial declaration, an implementation plan for their commitments and a reformed governance mechanism for the European Environment and Health Process.

Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology POSTNote 539 on Creating Age-Friendly Cities cites the Mobility, Mood and Place (MMP) (reference 114) and a number of published papers from our previous research projects in this area.

1. Pushed forward knowledge in novel and important ways: We have further developed understanding of the environment's relationship to physical activity, outdoor mobility and mobility choices, social interaction, 'positive' and 'negative' emotional and neural states, and health outcomes in older adults. We have discerned key features of indoor and outdoor environments - from homes to streets to green spaces - which might be critical in supporting or impeding these factors. We have established that features of the built environment, such as the availability of green space, can have lifelong positive associations with successful ageing, and in particular on the domain of cognitive health. We have presented our findings widely in academic, practice and public arenas, and have developed evidence-based recommendations for built environment policy.

2. Engaged often-marginalised populations in research through creative, participatory techniques: We have developed innovative participatory design techniques and employed these with both undergraduate and postgraduate students and often-marginalised populations, including stroke survivors, people with dementia and older adults with visual and mobility impairments. We have utilised these techniques to co-design with these groups proposals for inclusive environments. We have captured our learning and findings in a touring exhibition, which has appeared at the House of Lords, the annual British Society of Gerontology Conference and at Scotland's national centre for design and architecture, the Lighthouse gallery in Glasgow, and in a popular non-academic written resource, 'The A-Z of Co-Design', which has been taken up by practitioners and professional bodies. 

3. Employed progressive technology in innovative ways to investigate original research topics: We have been the first to directly assess neural responses to urban and green environments in older adults, and neural changes associated with transitioning between these environments, using mobile electroencephalography (EEG). We have been one of the first academic teams to take this technology out of the lab and into the field. We have used a new form of predictive modelling (i.e. Correlated Component Regression (CRR)) to analyse both proprietary data and traditional raw EEG data. The approach offers three main advantages over conventional regression - it improves out of sample validity, handles collinearity and helps identify suppressor variables. We have triangulated EEG data with qualitative interview data and explored older adults' subjective responses to place through walking interviews.

4. Advanced lifecourse approaches to health and longitudinal analysis techniques: We have spatially indexed vast amounts of historical information (e.g. censuses, civic surveys, medical officer health reports, and Post Office directories) for the City of Edinburgh and integrated these with contemporary datasets. We have advanced the methods required to merge complex residential information attained through retrospective questionnaires from existing cohort studies, in our case the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936, with area-level indicators of greenspace, socioeconomic deprivation, social capital, and the tobacco and alcohol retail environment. This has stimulated new and important research questions on the changing dynamic and subsequent effect on health of several features of the built environment, rather than concentrating on one issue in isolation.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We are already having impact via a mention of relevant research on neural imaging in the WHO European Region Report on Urban green Spaces and Health (2016) and POSTnote 539 (2016) (see Impact section) and engagement with the parliamentary offices at Westminster and in Holyrood. 

We have been invited to present our findings to a seminar at Scottish Government's offices by the Principal Research Officer, Rural and Environment Science and Analytical Services, and plan to do so in the next two-three months.

We have an ESRC Impact Acceleration Account award (administered by the University of Edinburgh) which will start in April 2017. It will assist in knowledge exchange and research uptake by our partners. The objectives of the project, 'Habitats for Happy and Healthy Ageing' are as follows: 

1. To feed findings from the Mobility, Mood and Place (MMP) research project into the European Union Committee of the Regions' emerging EU Urban Agenda. Likewise, into the Action Plans of members of the Covenant on Demographic Change (CDC) as they move towards making their town, city or region age-friendly, under one or more of the World Health Organization's eight established criteria.

2. To project manage an exhibition of co-designed age-friendly exemplars from MMP, which premiered in July 2016 as part of Scotland's Year of Innovation, Architecture and Design, targeting at least two venues within Europe. This will allow us both to capitalise on the work undertaken for our first objective, and help us build links with members of the Design for All Foundation's Network for Excellence: Towns and Cities for All.

3. To develop and deliver training on effective co-design with older people to local authorities, professional practitioners and not-for-profit groups. The training will be based on one of the main non-academic dissemination tools from MMP, a professionally-designed A-Z of Co-Design which explores&amp;nbsp;participatory design's origins,&amp;nbsp;methods and techniques, key roles, principles and issues.

4. To build understanding and uptake of evidence-based policy and practice recommendations among health, design and other professionals in the specialist area of stroke survival and rehabilitation. 

Our partners will assist in this as follows:
Mobility, Mood and Place (MMP) has been supported from the outset by a proactive group of 20 partners from government, industry and the not-for-profit sector. Four of these partners (Design for All Foundation, Architecture and Design Scotland, Chest Heart &amp;amp; Stroke Scotland and NHS Health Lothian) have collaborated with us on this proposal, which also involves a further two new partners (the Covenant on Demographic Change and the Centre for Accessible Environments) with whom we have developed excellent relationships over the course of MMP. All partners will work closely with us to deliver our objectives as follows:

1. The Covenant on Demographic Change is a singular pathway to engaging with c.150 authorities and organisations who have committed to making Europe's towns, cities and regions age-friendly. Launched in Brussels in 2015, the Covenant is a not-for-profit association established under Belgian Law.
2. The role of the Design for All Foundation is to collect and share examples of good practice in 'Design for All' around the world, including through its 100-strong Network of Excellence for inclusive towns and cities. It is a private, non-profit-making organisation based in Barcelona.
3. Architecture and Design Scotland (A&amp;amp;DS) is Scotland's national placemaking champion. Part of its remit is to promote Scottish architectural innovation on the global stage, for example through the Prospect North exhibition of community-based projects which was launched earlier this year at the Venice Biennale. 
4. The Centre for Accessible Environments is the UK's leading provider of consultancy and training in inclusive design and access to the built environment for disabled people and older&amp;nbsp;people. 
5. Chest Heart &amp;amp; Stroke Scotland's mission is to improve the quality of life for people in Scotland affected by chest, heart and stroke illness. It funds medical research, influences public policy, and provides advice, information and support.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B00FBED7-6CCD-4ED5-8868-05FA5ABC871B</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56c32f4b3bb3d6.28390829</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Environment,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://sites.eca.ed.ac.uk/mmp/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Membership of National Walking Strategy working group</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DF257B47-C60F-4EE5-A274-1465EA20BA07</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5463328736e600.00734182</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Membership of a guidance committee</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://scottishgovernment.presscentre.com/News/Let-s-Get-Scotland-Walking-d96.aspx</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Invited member of the Scottish Government's National Walking Strategy Delivery Forum</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A6639F10-21CD-4671-9158-C5C828E11A69</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58bdea5b630c26.81328858</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>NIHR Age and Ageing Specialty Group in Scotland, seminar on Patient and Public Involvement - 'Optimising the design of indoor and outdoor environments for older people through co-creation.
