Many patients require steroids, long-term immunosuppressants and antibody therapies and 75% ultimately require major surgery +/- ileostomy. 

The cause of Crohn's remains unknown but since 2007 there has been huge progress in understanding its genetic basis. In particular defects in a process called autophagy (a cellular pathway for the degradation and recycling of cellular components), have been highlighted in the development of ileal CD. Work pioneered by the Kaser lab has focused attention on the role of the Paneth cell and revealed these as potential originators of intestinal inflammation. Paneth cells are intestinal secretory cells that regulate the interface between the millions of bugs that live in the gut and our immune system. In a mouse model cells with the same human genetic risk for impaired autophagy become stressed in the presence of intestinal microbiota and the animals were found to develop ileal inflammation with many of the features of Crohn's disease. The key aims of this research proposal are 

1. To extend our knowledge of the key inflammatory pathways that Paneth cells engage 
2. Tounderstand how and which immune cells are affected downstream of this
3. To identify if there are similar biomarkers allowing CD patients to be stratified based on this disease mechanism

This research will be undertaken in the Kaser laboratory at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. Using the mouse model described above Paneth cells will be isolated to study what inflammatory mechanisms are engaged that result activation of specific immune cells and ultimately in ileal inflammation. Following this, human biopsies from patients with CD and similar genetic impairment will be investigated to see if these observations are recapitulated.
The research will be conducted by Dr Joya Bhattacharyya, a specialist registrar in gastroenterology who has taken time out of clinical training to undertake research training and pursue a PhD. 

The overarching theme of this research proposal is to use a mouse model to gain mechanistic insight into the cause of Crohn's disease, thereby allowing us to understand how genetic risk factors result in intestinal inflammation. This line of research may ultimately identify specific biomarkers that can be used to target therapies towards those patients most likely to benefit from them.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>There is an emerging body of literature highlighting the role of Paneth cells in the pathogenesis of Crohn's Disease (CD). Paneth cells are specialised intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) that are situated at the interface between the intestinal microbiota and our immune system. Recent work has revealed a compensatory role for autophagy in restraining endosplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in IEC. Hypomorphic autophagy in the setting of unabated ER stress within Paneth cells results in spontaneous ileitis that phenocopies human ileal CD. This mouse model may provide the first plausible mechanism of how genetic autophagy defects may lead to ileal CD, affording us an excellent opportunity to investigate the biological mechanisms that link a major genetic risk factor of CD with a specific disease phenotype.

This research proposal seeks to address three key questions:
1. What are the inflammatory mechanisms that genetically autophagy-deficient, ER-stressed Paneth cells engage?
2. What is the activation state of bona fide mucosal immune cells in this model of ileal Crohn's disease?
3. Can Crohn's disease patients be stratified based on this disease mechanism?

This research proposes flow assisted cytometric sorting of Paneth cells with subsequent transcriptomic and proteomic analysis allowing delineation of the inflammatory mechanisms engaged. Using multi-colour flow cytometric analysis we aim to characterise intraepithelial and lamina propria immune cells and determine their activation state. Using the data deduced from the murine model system, biopsies from patients with Crohn's disease with the same genetic risk alleles will be investigated. The aim is to recapitulate these observations in human samples with the view to demonstrating that patients with ileal CD can be stratified based on genotype, Paneth cell phenotype and markers of activation of mucosal immune cells.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Large scale genome wide association studies (GWAS) have shed light onto the genetic underpinning of many complex diseases by identifying genetic risk loci. GWAS have been particularly successful in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and the UK IBD genetics consortium has played and is playing a major role in this success. Functional studies that can elucidate the biological pathways by which genetic risk loci translate into disease constitute the essential next step.

Patients with Crohn's disease (CD) are a heterogenous group and at the current time it is not possible to predict response to therapy, development of complications and need for surgery. IBD accounted for direct UK healthcare costs of &amp;pound;720m in 2004 (latest figures) - a figure that does not include the indirect costs that result from loss of earnings and job prospects. Key goals in the future treatment of Crohn's disease will centre on development of novel, targeted and specific avenues of therapeutic intervention that are personalised and stratified. One way of achieving this is by identifying biomarkers of a specific phenotype of CD that emerges from complex gene and environmental interactions that converge on a functional pathway that mediates the characteristic lesion (i.e. ileitis vs colonic CD). This gene to function approach is at the heart of this research proposal. The main beneficiaries will therefore be patients with CD, in particular patients with ileal CD who will benefit from mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of a particular subset of CD leading to personalised therapy stratified by genotype.

The goal of personalised medicine has been much talked about in relation to common disease, but its delivery requires proof of this concept beyond the field of oncology. The proposed study represents an important step in this direction, attempting to translate findings from GWAS through improved mechanistic understanding to ultimate improvement in clinical care and particularly targeting oftreatments to patients manifesting defects in the function of the autophagy pathway. There are currently very few if any such examples of stratified medicine outside the field of oncology, and this are largely because the causal mechanisms at least for inflammatory disease are poorly understood. Success here thus has the potential for wider impact beyond IBD and gastroenterology, demonstrating the potential of this paradigm to funding agencies and policy makers in the NHS. Personalised and stratified therapy in IBD and inflammatory disease will lead to better patient care and more efficient use of limited resources.

The UK pharmaceutical industry represents a mid/long term beneficiary of this research, both for the development of personalised therapeutics that are based on biological pathways genetically affected, or via development of novel therapeutic approaches or the re-purposing of currently available therapeutics.

The academic beneficiaries have already been detailed.

As this application is for a PhD training fellowship, this proposal will contribute to the development of key research skills and the professional development of Dr Joya Bhattacharyya. In particular she will develop the skills to transform genetic data into functional biological insight - a skill that is highly sought after in the academic world.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>306108</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>DD6FEACF-DC07-4821-82DB-3E8A2A978A7B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Defective ATG16L1-mediated removal of IRE1a drives Crohn's disease-like ileitis.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Journal of experimental medicine</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/7d38f820679cdddd18ce8cedf2ebc5c5"><gtr:id>7d38f820679cdddd18ce8cedf2ebc5c5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Tschurtschenthaler M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0022-1007</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>58c136eb829e63.14081124</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/N001893/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>D81A471F-556F-4570-BF6A-5D197943223C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Oral and Gastrointestinal</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1BF330A9-C7B5-49C5-B54B-CF4FAE6DF1D8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.1  Biological and endogenous factors</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
