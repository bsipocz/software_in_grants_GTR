Proximity plays an essential role in such learning as it underpins the process of recognition. It is a natural link between observations of objects, and an overall judgement of their shared commonalities. Sets of objects can be studied starting from the perspective that some are similar, while others are different. So, a suitable proximity measure should be designed first to identify patterns and model clusters. Statistical learning offers a plethora of powerful techniques, which mostly rely on vectorial representations of objects in some input vector space. The proximity between objects is modelled as the Euclidean distance between their vector representations. Many currently available data are, however, non-vectorial by origin, e.g. text, binary files, shapes, ECG signals or protein sequences. Although some ways exist to represent them in a vectorial form, these may be of poor quality for the final goal or difficult to obtain. If objects contain an identifiable structure, such as shapes or texts, structural descriptions are advisable for whichedit distances can be used. Proximity is then the natural concept to represent heterogeneous information.Kernel methods are a statistical alternative to vectorial representations, but their application is limited due to the constraint of positive semidefinite (psd)kernels. If we wish to model the human ability of recognition, the traditional use of statistical learning does not address this question well. Many studies in cognitive science suggest that non-Euclidean or non-metric measures are used by humans to judge proximity. In statistical learning, proximity is imposed beforehand by the nature of Euclidean distance or a kernel.Many proximity measures are non-metric or non-Euclidean. These are e.g. derived when shapes or sequences are aligned in a template matching process. Non-metric examples are measures in the presence of partially occluded objects, pairwise alignments of proteins, variants of Hausdorff distance or normalised edit distances. Although there exists a zoo of measures used for comparison of objects, a proper framework for generalisation is still lacking. Researches usually rely on the nearest neighbor distances, or choose to correct the measure to be metric or Euclidean.The important question is when such type of approaches are both justified and beneficial for the final goal. If the measure describes the problem well, as judged by experts, and its deviation from metric or Euclidean behaviour is large, one expects a significant loss of information, when corrections are applied. If such deviations are small, they may be considered as noise. Our research is focused on understanding the properties of general proximity measures and developing useful learning strategies. Our goal is to investigate the use of non-Euclidean spaces and setting up learning paradigms there. We will develop indices to characterise general measures and used them to suggest a learning approach. The two important problems are:(1) design and learning of the proximity measure from a set of examplesand (2) given pairwise proximity data, propose the best learning paradigm. Since many proposals are already available in (1), (2) needs to be developed first by proposing learning methods in pseudo-Euclidean and Banach spaces. Additionally, a framework for asymmetric measures will be suggested.Having developed the tools, we will investigate ways of learning proximity measures from a set of examples. We plan to do it in a probabilistic contextand incorporate Bayesian reasoning. As a result, our methods will be applied to practical problems in machine learning, imaging and bioinformatics.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-02-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>239487</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/D066883/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>70</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
