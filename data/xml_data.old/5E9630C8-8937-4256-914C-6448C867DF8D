This clock is very precise, as it is daily reset by timing cues we receive from the outside world, and especially environmental light. Early light experience has been shown to have an influence on the developing animal, so that the daily rhythms are shaped in a manner that lasts throughout its life. Early sensory experience is thus modifying adult behaviour and sculpting developing neural circuits. This is of particular concern in preterm infants, as they might be exposed to specific light conditions during the first critic weeks of life which may not only have acute or long-term disruptive effects on the developing biological clock, but it may also affect their weight gain, sleeping pattern and development in general. The main aim of this project is to determine the specific effects and consequences of early light experience at the visual level, and also on the biological clock located in the brain. Rodents (and specifically mice) have proven excellent models of human physiology with regard to biological rhythms in physiology and behaviour. I will therefore rear mice under different light conditions and I will then look at the effects of this early experience on visual function, expression of the daily locomotor activity rhythm, and of different neurotransmitters and clock gene expression at the brain clock level. In summary, by increasing understanding of the interaction between light conditions and the developing biological clock, I hope to improve knowledge and understanding of the effects of early experience on adults' behaviour, and thus provide a conceptual framework within which to develop specific strategies to promote improved care of neonates.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Light experienced during the lactation period has long-lasting effects on the rhythm of locomotor activity under constant light, constant darkness, light-dark cycles, and also on the response to a light pulse in darkness. Early light experience thus seems to affect the circadian responses of the animal to light. However, it is still unknown how early light affects the circadian system, both at the retinal level, and at the level of the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus, site of the principal clock in mammals. This work aims to determine the effect of early experience on the photic signalling pathways, and on different neural populations in the SCN, both in adults and on developing animals. I will thus study, for the first time, the effects of early light experience on retinal function and neural plasticity in the SCN.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>401797</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Early life events are important in understanding adult behaviour. Brain programming occurs when a stimulus at a critical period of development has lifelong effects. I have shown that environmental light experienced during the first few weeks after birth, has a profound effect on the animal's sleep-wake rhythm. Specifically, the locomotor activity rhythm of animals exposed to constant light, constant darkness or to light-dark cycling environments depends on the light experienced during the first 3 weeks after birth. This projects aims to determine the effects of early light experience on the photic signalling pathways at the retinal and at the brain clock level, as a model of early programming and plasticity.



First we determined the effects of early light experience on the retina, photoreceptor functioning, and light sensitivity. We have found that early light environment does not affect retinal function in pigmented mice, but in contrast, it has a big detrimental effect on albino mice: albino mice raised under continuous light will show impaired retinal function and damaged retinal morphology as adults.



Secondly, we examined the effects on the brain master clock, both at the molecular (clock gene expression) and at the cellular (photic transduction pathway) levels. We have demonstrated long-lasting effects of early light environment on the expression of key circadian neuropeptides in neurones within the brain circadian clock. We have also found alterations in glial cell morphology in the same brain region. Interestingly, we found no alteration in the response of the brain clock to light.



Finally, we are currently in the process of determining the time scale of effects of early light experience on the developing molecular clock.



Taken together, the results up to date suggest that, in pigmented mice, postnatal light environment has no major effects on retinal function. However, early experience has long-term effects on circadian behaviour which correspond with long-term alterations at the brain level. These results support the idea that early light experience can programme the developing brain.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>By studying the effects of early light on the adult's brain and behaviour, we will determine the significance of environmental conditions on the animal's development. This is a critical step to devise improved husbandry conditions for laboratory animals, and thus improve animal welfare. Finally, this is also a critical step to devise improved care of preterm infants in neonatal intensive care units. This work is of interest not only to researchers in the field of circadian biology but also, since it addresses fundamental issues in brain programming and neuroplasticity, to the wider scientific community.

Sensory experience during developmental stages exerts a powerful influence on the sculpting of developing neural circuits. The effect of early visual experience has been extensively studied at the visual cortex level. Visual experience entails both image-related and illuminance-related information, and surprisingly, not much is known about the effects of the latter. Since there is a subset of cells specialised in illuminance reception (the melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells), illuminance-related visual information may also play an important role in brain development. Overall, the output of this project is of interest not only for circadian biology, but also for developmental neuroscience and vision sciences in general.



In addition, the study of the modifications induced by postnatal light on the developing brain, a time when the circadian system matures and is most sensitive to external stimuli, represents a step towards understanding the role of environmental factors in the shaping of neural circuitry. This is of particular interest in humans, as preterm infants might be exposed to specific light conditions in the neonatal intensive care units which may not only have acute or long-term disruptive effects on the developing biological clock, but also it may affect the sleeping pattern, the postnatal weight gain and the baby's visual development. Understanding the interaction between postnatal light conditions and the developing circadian system may prove useful to paediatricians and neonatologists, as it provides a conceptual framework within which to develop specific strategies to allow improved light conditions for preterm infants.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>EEB3280D-500D-487E-82A8-58F23CAD1863</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-121988952.27349266776d9cac</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Environment,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D810218B-730E-49F4-9C44-5C9450789E42</gtr:id><gtr:title>Differential hypothalamic tyrosine hydroxylase distribution and activation by light in adult mice reared under different light conditions during the suckling period.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Brain structure &amp; function</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9cbe30c6c1cb205f72ab80a16d146c9d"><gtr:id>9cbe30c6c1cb205f72ab80a16d146c9d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Brooks E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1863-2653</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>pm_5435adb5adb1d1b8a</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>8EE51B1A-8C81-4D7E-9BF0-B3ED41AC64CC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Lifelong consequences of early postnatal light environment</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/140d033916ed9f24197ba9e2839dbd06"><gtr:id>140d033916ed9f24197ba9e2839dbd06</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Maria Merce C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>doi_53d087087ada031c</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>2EAEB690-E6AA-495A-ABBF-187137947E62</gtr:id><gtr:title>Development of circadian rhythms: role of postnatal light environment.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9cbe30c6c1cb205f72ab80a16d146c9d"><gtr:id>9cbe30c6c1cb205f72ab80a16d146c9d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Brooks E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0149-7634</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>54479fddc89372.50140962</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>EE72E983-2A9A-41D9-A417-5A50605A5AA5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Postnatal light alters hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function and induces a depressive-like phenotype in adult mice.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The European journal of neuroscience</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f1dae4470e2bc4e29f7d95b743305bc0"><gtr:id>f1dae4470e2bc4e29f7d95b743305bc0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Coleman G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0953-816X</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>589d9cc32f2616.91397540</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C4980401-7CF9-4BF0-8B20-4C46D830FA53</gtr:id><gtr:title>Postnatal Light Effects on Pup Stress Axis Development Are Independent of Maternal Behavior.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Frontiers in neuroscience</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/f1dae4470e2bc4e29f7d95b743305bc0"><gtr:id>f1dae4470e2bc4e29f7d95b743305bc0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Coleman G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1662-453X</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fcd848158b8.21264436</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>3E0C1146-EB8B-4B1A-9991-6D8BAC33DC8E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Programming of mice circadian photic responses by postnatal light environment.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>PloS one</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/9cbe30c6c1cb205f72ab80a16d146c9d"><gtr:id>9cbe30c6c1cb205f72ab80a16d146c9d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Brooks E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1932-6203</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>54479fdd99f502.91592002</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/F019718/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
