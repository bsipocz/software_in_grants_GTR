These museums have the potential to reconnect the young generation of Egyptians with an important historical era during which Egypt was leading a renaissance in the Arab world. They represent three types of Egyptian cultural heritage: their tangible architectural heritage of high historical significance; their tangible exhibited content; and their intangible heritage linked to socio-economic, cultural and political conditions of the Arab renaissance era. They also represent an important part of the memory of the Egyptian nation as depositories of the history of iconic figures in politics, music and literature that have shaped the whole of the Arab world. Despite their cultural and historical importance in Egypt, and the Arab world, these museums remain unknown to the vast majority of the Egyptians, particularly the younger generation. Furthermore, their location in down town Cairo and within walking distance from three metro stations means that they are highly accessible but not necessarily visible.
The main objectives of the Belle &amp;Eacute;poque Cairo Museums Itinerary (BECAMI ) are as follows:
1. To establish a multidisciplinary collaborative project between UK and Egypt academics to increase the visibility and accessibility of these eleven forgotten 'Belle Epoque' museums by the creation of both physical and virtual itineraries, hence bringing them into a cluster.
2. To engage, physically and virtually, local communities and tourists with these museums. 
3. To engage university students and school children in the creation of a walking itinerary of 3,6 km and a narrative connecting seven of these eleven museums, hence allowing a greater visibility and an increased number of visitors from a variety of backrounds. 
4. To co-produce art installations and publicity material for each of these museums by engaging school children and university students through workshops hence facilitating emotional ownership for these museums. 
5. To promote communication and exchanges between the cluster of eleven Cairo museums by linking them via a virtual itinerary platform through which they can sustain collaboration in educational and community engagement projects. 
6. To create twinning of some of these museums with UK museums of similar themes. As such the Umm Kaltoum and Mohamed Abdelwahab museums will be twinned with the Liverpool Beatles museum, and the Cairo Railway museum will be twinned with the National Railway museum in York. These virtual twinnings will allow the sharing good practices in education and community engagement and increase their international visibility. 
7. To engage school children and multidisciplinary teams of university students in a competition to design physical sign-posts for the museums itinerary and the production of a connecting narrative that will weave the tangible and intangible components of these museums. 
 The project will be facilitated through three workshops (two in Cairo and one in Sheffield) bringing together a multidisciplinary team of architects, human geographers , artists . The project is led by two principal investigators : Dr Magda Sibley, Senior Lecturer and Director of Humanities at the School of Architecture at Sheffield University and Professor Galila Elkadi, Head of Architecture at the French University in Cairo.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>BECAMI project will have a positive impact on Cairo museums that have been forgotten and have limited number of visitors. The project will directly benefit the eleven Belle Epoque museums selected in this project and who will be established as a themed cluster. Their visibility will be increased via the development of a physical and a virtual itinerary which will act as a catalyst for re-appropriating by the younger generation of Egyptians of this heritage . This will be facilitated through the direct engagement of school children and university students who will also benefit from workshops and activities that will increase their curiosity and empower them through the co-production of museum art installations, itinerary sign posts and narratives linking the various museums into a virtual platform. The activities planned in this project will allow both students from different disciplines and children from different schools in the proximity of these museums to develop an emotional ownership of the museums cluster and become ambassadors of these museums in their schools and their community. In addition , the project will establish a strong interaction between theses museums via the virtual web platform , allowing them to share good practices but also to form a critical mass, empowering them to develop innovative ways for a wider engagement with the public, the cultural tourists and the large number of educational institutions is Egypt. 
 The BECAMI networking proposal responds to the need addressed by the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Antiquities to set plans to generate new economic opportunities by shifting from consumption to production by the year 2016. The under-used Museums should become accessible to everyone, particularly at a time when school and university education in Egypt is being reviewed to encourage new forms of learning and collaboration between different educational institutions. 
 Furthermore, BECAMI network UK will initiate twining activities between museums in Sheffield/Liverpool/ York and their equivalen in Cairo via the virtual itinerary platform. It is hoped that such an intiative will become self sustaining in terms of international cooperation and understanding of the histories of different cultures, through active participation of the younger generation. The results of this project will be disseminated to various key stakeholders and in particular to decision makers in the Ministry of Culture to inform their future policies regarding the enhancement of the educational role of museums through partnership and engagement with educational institutions and their students. The museums will also benefit from exposure to a variety of income generating activities that museums in the UK develop to sustain themselves economically. 

 The self-sustaining processes of collaboration of the eleven museums facilitated through the BECAMI network and the emotional ownership by the younger generation will be one of the measures of success of this project, in addition to the greater exposure and interaction of these museums with the general public.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-02-12</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>31723</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop with arts and architecture students from different universities in Egypt to develop a belle epoque museum itinerary in Cairo</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>82EE50AD-8F8B-4CAD-BA67-C0C30BC58AD2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was a three day engagement workshop which took place in January 2017 and involved 33 undergraduate students who were shorlisted from an open call for participation.

This event was followed by two days of exclusive visits on 14th &amp;amp; 15th of November to all named and participating museums in this project. More than 75 participants, speakers, panel chairs, the museum directors and the project team attended the seminar from Egypt and UK. The Seminar was comprised of three major sessions that mainly covered relevant presentations and debates around innovative methods of preserving Cairo's Cultural Museums which entails a significant period of Egypt's forgotten past.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58cab1e6349e19.07114808</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>We have facilitated communication between a number of belle epoque museum directors in Cairo to start discussions about increasing visibility , accessibility and public engagement with school children and university students.
