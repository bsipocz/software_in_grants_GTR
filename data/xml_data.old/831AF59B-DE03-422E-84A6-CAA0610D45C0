This, in turn, carries with it considerable potential benefit to both government and to the citizen, in terms of cost-savings, accessibility, democratic participation, environmental sustainability etc. However, the provision of public Internet access in public libraries has also led to ongoing concerns that such access would lead to misuse and the downloading of inappropriate and illegal content. In particular, the management of Internet access on the part of minors in public libraries has, raised difficult issues with regard to responsibility for their protection. Concerns have also been expressed by librarians with regard to their own legal liability in the event of misuse of library public access facilities. However, to date there has been little research undertaken that provides a comprehensive picture of measures that are being taken to address these concerns, or of the effectiveness and impact of alternative approaches: this is of particular concern with regard to the key professional value of preservation of freedom of access to information. 

Therefore, this research aims to identify and quantify measures being taken in UK public libraries to regulate and manage access to Internet content. These will include technical measures, such as the implementation of filtering software, and organisational measures, such as the adoption of Internet Use Policies and the provision of user education. Similar research will be carried out with a range of commercial public internet access providers, such as cybercafes, in order that the public library service can learn from practice elsewhere. This will also help to evaluate any 'added value' offered through the provision of access in libraries as opposed to cybercafes. In addition to identifying what measures are being taken, the impact of measures adopted will be evaluated: what are the problems raised by these measures for those charged with managing public Internet access? How do the measures impact on the user's freedom of access to information and freedom of expression? Are the measures effective in regulating access to inappropriate or illegal content? How could the management of public internet access be improved to ensure stronger legal compliance without impacting adversely on freedom of enquiry? Are children being adequately protected or do alternative measures need to be considered? How can public librarians be protected from legal liability as a result of their clients' actions? 

These are all key questions for the 21st century public library service. This research will enable a more informed approach to be taken in the management of public Internet access that maximises access to information whilst minimising the risks from misuse of such access. 
The study will adopt a mixed methods approach involving desk research, including analysis of documented approaches adopted elsewhere in the world, questionnaire survey analysis, interviews and focus groups with key stakeholders. Outcomes from the project will include the dissemination of examples of good practice in managing public access to the Internet for all user groups in UK public libraries, as well as the production of a set of guidelines for UK public librarians to assist them in managing to provide public access to the Internet whilst remaining within the boundaries of legal, ethical and practical constraints. The findings will also be used to provide relevant knowledge and guidance to professional bodies in order that they may offer strong leadership, advice and support to those charged with the public provision of public Internet access.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Potential beneficiaries of the research include:
1. Policy makers at national and international level: national governments and international bodies, e.g. the EU, have all been involved in trying to address the issue of managing public internet access. An example can be seen with the Council of Europe guidelines on public internet access (2001) or the Museum Libraries &amp;amp; Archives Consultation on draft guidance on the management of controversial material in public libraries (2008). The Home Office Prevent Strategy (2011) highlights the importance of the issue, and notes that 'we are unable to determine the extent to which effective filtering is in place in schools and public libraries'.
2. Policy makers at local level: preliminary research indicates that decision-making with regard to the management of public internet access in public libraries takes place at the local authority level. However, there is currently a dearth of guidance available to such decision-makers, and a lack of transparency with regard to measures in place in other local authority areas. The findings will provide a critical source of information to guide decision making.
3. Chief librarians: heads of service in the public library sector carry responsibility for legal compliance of their service, and the protection of the rights and safety of their users. This duty includes the prevention of illegal file-sharing, infringement of copyright and access to obscene or dangerous internet content. At the same time, they are bound by a professional code to promote the principle of freedom of access to information. Managing this delicate balance can pose significant difficulties, and is hampered by a lack of up-to-date information on best practice or the range of alternative measures available to deal with this issue. 
4. Other library personnel: those on the front-line of managing internet access find themselves in the difficult situation of having to 'police' users, whilst trying to provide a supportive and encouraging environment for users who are sometimes reluctant to engage with the public library service (e.g. teenagers). They also on occasion find themselves having to implement policies with which they have not been fully apprised, or in the formulation of which they have had no involvement. This raises significant challenges, and it is anticipated that the findings of this project will lead to the provision of training materials and workshops that will lend support to such personnel.
5. Public library users: the provision of internet access in public libraries is of key importance to those who do not have access at home or at work. Without public internet access, there is a risk of a proportion of society being routinely excluded from internet access, thus perpetuating existing inequalities and extending the digital divide between the information rich and the information poor. However, even when such access is available, if overly restrictive measures are in place to prevent misuse, users may not be able to access critical information sources. Examples may be given of teenagers wishing to access content on contraception and safe sex, or on issues concerned with sexuality. Thus, findings that lead to intelligent and informed decision-making with regard to public internet access, that does not rely on heavy-handed measures put in place to 'protect' the decision makers and implementers, could offer real benefits to users of public library internet access (and their parents).
6. Library users and personnel will also benefit from the potential development of more appropriate technical solutions as software developers will have access to information that will enable them to customise their solutions better to fit the needs of the library market; professional bodies charged with providing guidance to policy makers and practitioners will also benefit. UK society as a whole will benefit from the enhanced transparency and protection for freedom of expression</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>202004</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Participation in panel debate at IFLA WLIC 2014 on Mass Surveillance and libraries</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B8A1DF1D-B61A-4E78-8A33-E570C8AB377A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>100+ attendees including practitioners, policy makers and academics.

To summarise the key findings (which will also be published in detail forthcoming journal papers currently in press in the Journal of Documentation and the Journal of Librarianship and Information Science):

 - UK public libraries play a key role in providing internet access to a significant minority of otherwise excluded citizens (to date, findings indicate that this group is primarily composed of young unemployed males and senior citizens). This role is expanding as the UK government moves forward with its 'Digital by Default' programme of electronic delivery of government services;

 - internet access in public libraries is routinely filtered, whether at the ISP or at the local level. Decisions concerning filtering are most often taken by senior library personnel, but ina significant number of cases by non-library personnel (e.g. IT staff or local government personnel), and are not subject to high levels of transparency;

 - the provision of wifi access is a growing but less regulated aspect of public internet access in libraries;

 - considerable levels of power appear to have been devolved to technology organisations, such as the suppliers of filtering or booking control software and ISPs. These organisations may not hold the same commitment to the professional values of freedom of access to information which is a core value of the library professional;

 - the most commonly blocked content is that of sexual/ obscene 'speech', and users report concerns with regard to the over-blocking of content;

 - nevertheless, a surprise finding of the research thus far is the degree of acceptance among users - and even among librarians - of the need for filtering software, and its utility in maintaining the public library as a 'decent' space that is free from offensive materials;

 - there is a strong case for investigating the privacy impacts of monitoring measures that are currently in place in many libraries - this is an area where future research would be useful.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings of this study will enable the formulation of policy at national level in the UK that will provide a uniformity of approach, and stronger guidance for library professionals. It will also save a 'reinvention of the wheel' whereby every PLA starts from scratch in drafting their own policy. Ultimately, it is hoped that the dissemination of project findings will lead to a heightened awareness of professional codes of ethics with regard to the value of freedom of speech.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C366E13C-B03D-4FA5-A503-CDC06B0A85A4</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>r-3197032951.9333625777fd91c</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.lboro.ac.uk/microsites/infosci/lisu/maiple/about.html</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Invitation to join IFLA Freedom of Access to Information &amp;amp;
