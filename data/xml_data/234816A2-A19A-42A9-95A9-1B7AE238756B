The changing structure of the Programme since its inception means there is a clear need for additional capacity to support the work of dissemination and impact, especially as demand for its authoritative and impartial source of information has risen steeply. Moreover, there is also an opportunity to expand that profile outside of Westminster and Whitehall, reaching across the UK.

Thus my appointment will allow for a substantial increase in the ability of the Programme to respond to demands from politicians, civil servants, media and the general public for detailed input to their work and debates. This will include a number of more structured interventions.

Firstly, there will be an element of original research, on the attitudes and positions of other EU member states to the Brexit discussions, focusing in particular on outputs on social media. This work builds on previous work I conducted during the EU referendum as a Senior Fellow on the Programme, and extends current research being undertaken as a Research Investigator on a Brexit Priority grant. Given the low level of awareness in the UK of the diversity and scope of other member states, this work offers an important part of building any understanding of what might happen in the Article 50 negotiations.

Secondly, there will be a series of seven &amp;quot;Synergy Events&amp;quot; to discuss key issues in and around the Article 50 negotiations. These will bring together speakers from different countries and backgrounds - policy-makers, think tanks, journalists, academics and others - to consider how particular parts of the evolving negotiations might work and will be held across the UK, in all four nations, to generate engagement with local stake-holders. Specific topics would be driven by the negotiations themselves, but might cover such matters as any financial settlement, citizens' rights or transitional arrangements. These would be open events, with summaries produced in a variety of media for wider circulation.

Thirdly, there will be work to make new connections between the various individuals and projects currently within the Programme. This will include the commissioning of new joint publications, on the lines of those already produced by the Programme, covering topical issues such as transitional regimes, ratification and future paths for the UK-EU relationship. In addition, members of the Programme will be invited to be interviewed - individually or in small groups - for a series of podcasts to showcase the depth and range of their work.

Fourthly, there will be a substantial amount of more general dissemination and engagement work, including contributions to public speaking events, media interviews, submissions to Parliamentary enquiries, presentations at party conferences, as well as briefings to politicians, civil servants and the media. One particular area of activity here will be a high level of social media presence, using current strengths in blogging, podcasting and tweeting.

Finally, I will work closely with the Director, the new Leadership coordinator and the central team on the overall management of the Programme, to ensure optimal use of the Programme's resources to achieve strategic objectives over the time-frame of the role.

All of this work will be grounded in my particular areas of expertise in EU politics, euroscepticism and negotiation practice, all of which are highly relevant to the current political situation and which complement and expand the research activities of the Director.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The work of the Deputy Director is primarily directed towards engagement with the public debate about the UK's relationship with the EU, in the context of Brexit and the Article 50 negotiations on withdrawal. There are four main groups that will benefit from the Fellowship. The work and outputs of the Fellowship will be tailored to meet their differing requirements.

The first key audience is that of the mass media. In the context of Brexit, the media are a vital actor in the construction and development of public debate, and thus in need of research-informed contributions. The summarising work of the contributions to the Programme's activities will be central in meeting this need, supplemented by the outputs of the seven &amp;quot;Synergy Events&amp;quot;, all of which will represent excellent opportunities for engagement with national and international media outlets. In addition, there will be an active use of social media, podcasting and blogging to provide high-tempo contributions, further increasing the attractiveness of engaging with the material I produce.

Related to this work will be that with practitioners, in the fields of party politics, civil society organisations and public administration (both national and European). The same mechanisms as for journalists will be used to extend existing connections with practitioners and generate useful outputs. With an active and pressing public debate, the value of this work will be made clear to such users, grounded as it will be in an impartial, research-grounded approach.

Ultimately, the wider British public will be a beneficiary from this work and activity. Particularly in the context of the Article 50 negotiation, the availability of concise, informed research-driven materials, presented in clear and simple-to-understand terms will be of use in supporting and stimulating that debate. My availability through the Programme, social media (and mass media, to a lesser extent) will encourage members of the public to engage with this material, especially that produced in response to more localised developments in the public debate.

Most narrowly, there is a benefit to academics working on British European policy, political rhetoric and political activism. A combination of a peer-reviewed journal article and presentations at academic conferences will be the avenues for dissemination primarily directed at this audience, supplemented by participation in the seven &amp;quot;Synergy Events&amp;quot;, collaborative publications and blogs. This work will form the basis for on-going discussion and debate within the community, with its combination of original research and of summarising existing work.

Overall, the work relies on its ability to engage with this range of users, not simply to valorise the activity, but also to ensure that it is properly grounded and directed in its support of public debate.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>161699</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/R007381/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>754F2ED0-AD87-4B89-BE75-A37A5A5BF77D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>European/EU Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5BAFFA07-4055-4FE0-BE2D-FF47ECC4B6BF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Politics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
