Unlike pulse oximetry widely used in medical practice, oxygen sensors based on the quenching of luminescence by oxygen is a technique that can provide rapid indication of the local oxygen concentration with a resolution down to microscale region which is determined by the size of the optical fibre substrate used. This technique can provide immediate information on the concentration of oxygen within the small area of an organ or a tissue of critically ill patients (e.g. during an operation or during endoscopic examination of such organs as lungs, gastrointestinal tract, urinary system etc), which can be used to find out the exact location of a disease focus or else to monitor the healing process during treatment. 

Optical oxygen sensors are quite common for general use (i.e. in non-biological conditions), while this technology is currently only being developed within UK and worldwide for biomedical use . There is a particular need for highly sensitive (to allow for miniaturisation) and biocompatible materials to make significant progress in the direction of sensors for biological conditions. The overall scientific goal of this project is thus to develop biocompatible and robust materials for use in oxygen sensing within biological media. 

Recently the PI has developed a range of metal cluster complexes that demonstrate high potential for luminescence-based oxygen sensing applications. Specifically, the proof-of-concept studies demonstrate that, even without optimisation, materials based on these complexes have sensitivity to oxygen sensing comparable to the state-of -the art materials. Moreover, this compounds are based on cheap starting materials that do not show any significant toxicity and are highly photo-stable. As such, these moieties are far more advanced luminophores for biomedical oxygen sensing than any other materials that are currently under consideration in the research community (e.g. precious metal complexes, quantum dots, organic dyes). 

To advance the state of the art in the area of biomedical oxygen sensing, this project (i) will use these recently developed metal cluster complexes as precursors to generate a library of biocompatible materials with high oxygen sensing capacity and (ii) will evaluate the potential of these new materials in medical oxygen sensing.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The following personnel and organisations will benefit from the proposed research:

Patients, Healthcare practitioners and Diagnostics companies: 
Materials developed in this project integrated with an optical fibre as sensing probes/endoscopes will provide clinicians with real time monitoring/diagnostics tools for the measurement of oxygen concentration within organs (e.g. in lungs, blood vessels, genitourinary tract, gastrointestinal tract) or in tissue during the surgery of patients with critical illnesses. The same materials could be also integrated into point-of-care or smart wound dressings. 

Healthcare services: 
Such critical diseases as cancer, coronary heart disease and stroke, inflammation, are becoming more frequent with the ageing population and this carries huge financial burden on the NHS and other healthcare providers. Express diagnostics and avoiding disease re-occurrence through more efficient surgery would lead to ultimately improved patient care and treatment, reduced mortality and economic benefit to healthcare services. 

Knowledge based economy: 
Technology strategy board report (2011) states that sensing technologies make an important part of the UK economy with an estimated market cost of &amp;pound;3bn in the UK, while healthcare has been clearly identified as a major opportunity for sensing system technologies. The IP generated within the project (i.e. new materials for oxygen sensing and protocols for preparation of nanomaterials) will contribute to the development of the knowledge based economy. Specifically, the project PI (ECR) already has an established connection with key academic players in the UK working on medical sensing and medical photonics and works on building links with industry (e.g. Edinburgh Molecular Imaging Ltd) and these will be the first contact points in regards to commercialisation. As the project proceeds new opportunities for further R&amp;amp;D activities as well as commercialisation will certainly arise in the areas of oxygen snsing, antibacterial surfaces, fibre photonics and imaging. Indeed, there is a myriad of companies that would benefit from cheap materials for oxygen sensing including such UK and global companies as GSK, GE Healthcare, Alere, Mode Diagnostics, and Siemens.

Research personnel: 
One of the important elements of this project is the training of research personnel. For the PI, who is in the early stages of her academic career, this project will accelerate her career development by giving an unparalleled opportunity to build a research team and stretch her research in a new direction related to oxygen sensing and secure world recognition as an expert in the area of photoluminescence and oxygen sensing. At the same time the PDRA and the PhD student working on the project will be trained in the highly multidisciplinary areas of inorganic chemistry, polymer chemistry and processing, nanomaterials, luminescence and oxygen sensing. In addition to versatile research skills the PhD and the PDRA will also gain a set of complementary skills (communication, report/paper/project writing and mentoring) which will make them attractive for the broad range of employers. Finally, during the project the researchers will also get opportunities to interact with medical personnel during meetings with collaborators, which will help them to build an end-user oriented mind-set and approach in their research.

General public: 
The project team (PI, PDRA and PhD Student) will participate in local and national science festivals (e.g. UoH runs annual festival to showcase the most recent achievement within the University, which gathered more than 4.5K attendees in 2016!), as well as smaller outreach activities such as Caf&amp;eacute; Scientifique, meetings with children from local schools through StemNET and RSC and open days for potential students to inspire next generation of researchers and to generate better awareness of importance of research and science.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100745</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R006393/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E847DD9B-2053-4BC7-97A9-4213B185C968</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>80</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6723A70B-A523-40AB-9740-B6AD2A0677B7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medical &amp; health interface</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>561091A1-9FC9-4508-B1B2-2F3623E1FC9D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials Characterisation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>063026C5-CD0B-48AB-82F3-6359499A95D4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials Synthesis &amp; Growth</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>16595C3C-600D-4AD2-B394-16E06F96495F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Med.Instrument.Device&amp; Equip.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
