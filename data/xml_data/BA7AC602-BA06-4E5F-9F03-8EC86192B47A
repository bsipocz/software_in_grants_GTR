Because the UK is a signature member of the EU COST programme, EPSRC allows the opportunity to consider small grants to assist UK members of Working Groups of COST Actions. This research is in this category (D26WG0013/02: http://costchemistry.epfl.ch/docs/D26/d26-13-02.htm), and the work will achieve a transfer of expertise form specialist Density Functional Theory (DFT) groups in Fribourg and Paris to assist the Norwich-based research group of the PI (Stephenson), and will also allow exchange of materials with helicene specialists in Milan. Final products will be sent to Leuven for photophysics evaluation. The research will compare theoretical and experimental results, gained entirely in collaboration with other European research groups specialising in DFT and helicene synthesis. Molecules with helical pi systems contain electrons distributed within a helical environment which interact with light in an unusual way, which will be investigated by a combination of synthesis and calculation-based studies. Normally when polarising groups (electron accepting and electron donating groups) are attached to pi systems, irradiation with laser light promotes second harmonic generation (SHG: emission of light at twice the frequency of the illuminating light) but this has a strict requirement for a non-centrosymmetric arrangement of molecules. When both the electric and magnetic dipoles of the laser light are taken into account, however, this requirement no longer holds, and SHG can occur with centrosymmetric bulk samples. The molecules needed to study this phenomenon must have high molecular anisotropies and well as the normal polarised pi systems. The examples to be studied in this research are helicene derivatives substituted at one end with a cationic organometallic structure that serves as the polarising group.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-01-05</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-07-06</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>20413</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Namur</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Belgium, Kingdom of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Use of DFT calculations to preduct molecular structures and to assess nonlinear optical properties</gtr:description><gtr:id>1040809E-F2FE-485C-91F4-97DF1D6F7D6B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As a result of this collaboration I was able to buy a Gassian09 liscence for use on the &amp;quot;Grace&amp;quot; high performance cluster at UEA, and can teach my graduate students of to do DFT calculations, and to include the results in PhD theses, papers, and research proposals.

The collaborations concerned the properties of helicenes, and Beno&amp;icirc;t Champagne at Namour had published an important paper inwhich he calculated that helicenyl structures should exhibit two photon circular dichroism (TPCD) a a level above the detection limit for direct observation. The collaboration with Champagne allowed me to visit Namour and work with his group, and I was given user access to the Belgium National high performance computational cluster through this mollaboration. The nature of this computional work is such that I can launch Gaussion calculations for UEA to run remotely on either cluster, and similarly analyse the results. The travel in the collaboration is to learn how to do the science, and to discuss its outcomes.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>This grant was itself to facilitate a collaboration with Claude Daul, but allowed me to create a new collaboration with Beno&amp;icirc;t Champagne</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2007-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>UEA Open Days</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8D1C3CCF-6C27-452A-90E9-46E6605AC62E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As part of each University Open Day (there are three each year) the organic chemists at the School of Chemistry organise a demonstration event (usually molecule making; with model-building kits, or flavours and fragrances; with odour chemicals).
