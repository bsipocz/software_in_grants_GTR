&lt;p>This study with explore the stability of drinking at later life and the key events that are associated with changes in drinking patterns. Based on analysis of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, a study, which collects data on the health, economic position and quality of life of people aged over 50 and their partners, cross-sectional analysis of this data will establish the main patterns of drinking in later life and the risk factors associated with binge drinking (excessive drinking on one particular day) and drinking in excess of the recommended weekly limits.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The life history data will be used to identify past events and transitions that may be associated with later changes in drinking behaviour. This analysis will investigate the dynamics of the relationship between changes in alcohol consumption and health conditions and how these are associated with life course transitions and past experiences.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Health intervention policies to reduce harm from alcohol consumption have historically focused on younger ages in both the UK and other modern industrialised societies, although there is now growing concern about drinking at older ages. This issue has also been highlighted in the Parliamentary Select Committee for Science and Technology's report on alcohol guidelines. Users of this research will therefore include agencies promoting safe alcohol consumption, practitioners involved in delivering health and social care for older ages, and policy makers involved in the promotion and dissemination of harm-reduction strategies associated with drinking. The findings will also be relevant for the end-users as the analysis will draw attention to the dynamics of drinking and health at older ages. Lay interpretations of drinking at older ages often emphasise the ideal that 'no harm' can be done at older ages, but this research will set this observation into context, by discussing the potential risk factors and the trigger factors that might bring about a change in drinking practices at older ages.

To date, discussions around policy intervention which targets drinking behaviour at older ages have focussed on the desirability of age-specific recommended limits for alcohol intake. The general consensus among academic researchers and practitioners is that any recommendation away from a generic form will confuse people and necessitate arbitrary distinctions based on individual characteristics, such as age which are unlikely to be met with public endorsement. This research will not seek to make recommendations of the desirability of new limits, but will take a different approach through considering the dynamics and heterogeneity of drinking patterns. The team will work collaboratively with users to inform both practitioners working with older age groups as well as agencies involved in promoting health and well-being at old age and/or harm associated with alcohol about the socio-economic characteristics associated with harmful drinking, as well as the life course events that may bring about changes in drinking behaviour. The research will therefore enable agencies to target older people most at risk of suffering harm through alcohol consumption. The agencies involved here are potentially numerous, for example the Fire and Rescue Service has a particular interest in drinking in later life as this is a recognised safety risk in the home. Invitations to a wide, but selective group will be sent out to attend the workshops, which will be themed around i) identifying key issues surrounding drinking in later life; ii) discussion of interim findings; and, iii) implications for practice and policy recommendations. A fourth findings workshop will be organised in London to review the research with national agencies.

The project will adopt a practice-informed approach to analysis. Variables which will be included in the modelling process will be identified through a combination of dialogue with practitioners and older people and statistical and theoretical criteria. This dialogue will be facilitated by the workshops and the website blog (see below). An objective of the project is to promote the use of secondary data in health research and to highlight both the drawbacks and advantages of this empirical approach. 

Dissemination to user groups will necessitate the preparation of clear and succinct briefings. A balance will need to be maintained between clear and accessible dissemination strategies to ensure that the findings are not reduced to caricatures of drinking at older ages. Dissemination will include face to face and virtual activities and where possible will emphasise interactive engagement. In addition to a user seminar and policy briefings, virtual material will be made available via a project website and will include a podcast of the main findings and a forum for dialogue between users and the project team.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>155276</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Community workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4C9EDF3B-269D-4D28-A8CB-DE845FBCCB8D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We organised an event with the Beth Johnson Foundation in Stoke to talk about our research findings with older people in the community.

Our findings about drinking in later life differ from some populist interpretations, particularly with reference to gender and health.

The research involved analysis of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) to address the following aims:
1. To extend understanding of the diversity of patterns of alcohol consumption at older ages distinguishing between drinkers and non-drinkers, and among the latter those who binge drink and/or exceed weekly recommended amounts.
2. To identify the socio-demographic dynamics of drinking during later life and the life events that are associated with changes in drinking behaviours, including transitions in housing, employment, family life and relationships.
3. To explore the relationship between drinking and health conditions in later life
4. To establish the importance of secondary survey data, specifically the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), in supporting policy initiatives directed towards individual health behaviours
5. To inform health policy initiatives on drinking in later life through identifying the risks associated with excessive drinking (defined as either binge drinking or drinking more than recommended weekly amounts) and the relationship between alcohol consumption, health and well-being in later life.

The analysis aims were met in full and the research findings confirm the significance of indicators of well-being for older people's alcohol consumption. In particular rather than identifying specific harms associated with drinking in later life, we show that drinking can be considered an indicator of well-being, and it is older adults with better health and more resources (but also those who smoke) who drink most and who drink more often in later life. 

The impact from the research has been directed towards enhancing quality of life, health and creative output. Working with a range of stakeholders we can demonstrate both instrumental impact, though working with the charity Drinkaware on their current campaign to target harmful drinking among men aged 45-65, and conceptual impact, particularly contributing to public understanding of the issues associated with drinking in later life through coverage of the research findings in national media and presentations to non-academic audiences.

The relevant stakeholders for the project include members of the public, the drinks industry and practitioners working with both older people and alcohol issues and we have worked with these stakeholders as follows:

Members of the Public: Extending Understanding of the Issues Associated with Drinking in Later Life:
Members of the public have been involved at all stages of the research, from design, analysis through to dissemination. Working with the advocacy agency, the Beth Johnson Foundation, we established a lay expert group recruiting older adults from Stoke on Trent. This group met twice. The first workshop was held on 17th April 2013 at the Beth Johnson Foundation and 11 members of the public and Beth Johnson staff attended this workshop. This workshop was used to identify the issues that participants associated with drinking in later life to inform subsequent analysis. The second workshop was held on 16th May 2014 to discuss the findings of the research, again with 11 members in attendance. This workshop was designed to enhance interpretation of the research findings. 

An end of project dissemination event was organised in collaboration with Age UK in London on 19th September 2014 and two of the lay expert group were able to attend this event. This event was open to academics, members of the public and key practitioners and in total 37 people registered to attend the event. Participants included members of the public, academic researchers, staff from Age UK, representatives from the drinks industry, local government employees working on alcohol and drug misuse teams, and representatives from the charity sector including Alcohol Concern.

Following this event a press release was prepared by the PI in collaboration with McCann Public Relations (consultants for Keele University media and external relations). The press release was issued in December 2014 following the submission of the grant summary report to ESRC. The research findings were reported extensively in national, local and overseas media on 24th December 2014 and on following days including:

The Drinks Industry: Drinkaware Campaign Targeting Male Drinkers aged 45-65:

The drinks industry was not identified as stakeholder group in the grant application, though has emerged as one of the most important stakeholders. In June 2015 Clare Holdsworth was approached by Dr John Larsen, Director of Evidence and Impact at the charity Drinkaware to contribute to a forthcoming campaign targeting male drinkers aged 45 to 65. Drinkaware is an independent charity, supported by voluntary donations from the drinks industry and major UK supermarkets to reduce alcohol misuse and harm in the UK. The charity provides people with evidence-based information about alcohol and has identified male drinkers in the age group 45-65 as a key target group. It is proposing to launch a campaign to target older male drinkers in Autumn 2015 and since May 2015 has been gathering evidence and commissioning research on older male drinkers. Clare Holdsworth has been in correspondence with Dr Larsen since May 2015 and in June 2015 was interviewed by Simon Christmas, who is carrying out research for Drinkaware to inform the campaign. Drinkaware has been provided with full details of the research findings in response to the call for evidence and Clare Holdsworth presented the research findings at a workshop on 5th August 2015, attended by Drinkaware staff, representatives from Drinkaware PR and advertising agencies as well as other academics. For this workshop the ELSA analysis was restricted to the age group 45-65 to match the Drinkaware target group. The findings from the analysis have been used in framing the Drinkaware qualitative research with adults aged 45 to 65, in particular the finding that the relationship between partnership and alcohol consumption differs for men and women was used to stimulate discussions about reasons why some older men drink more. 

Researchers at Drinkaware are in the process of completing a systematic review of evidence on the impacts of older men's drinking and Clare Holdsworth has agreed to comment on this review. At the time of writing the details of the Drinkaware campaign have not been finalised but we continue to be in regular correspondence and will work with Drinkaware as the campaign is finalised.

Local Authority Employees: Alcohol and Drug Misuse Harm Prevention:
There has been some interest in the findings form local authority alcohol and drug misuse teams. In particular we have rerun analysis for Dorset County Council, following the dissemination meeting on 19th September 2014, to identify characteristics of older people who misuse alcohol.

Challenges in targeting impact:
Though there has been considerable public interest in the research, we have found it harder to identify public health practitioners as key stakeholders. Results of the study were requested by the Health Improvement Analytical Team (HIAT), at the Department of Health. One challenge is then determining where these results later go on to inform policy. Another challenge is that the research findings clearly demonstrate that alcohol consumption is associated with well-being in later life. As discussed with representatives from Age UK at the 19th September workshop, older wealthy and well-educated men are unlikely to respond to interventions that target their health, in fact they are more likely to anticipate to volunteer with Age UK to support older adults with fewer resources, rather than recognise themselves as recipients of public interventions. The media coverage is extremely useful in this regard as it identifies wealthy older men as the group that drink the most (as the Daily Mail cartoon illustrates) and hopefully this coverage has gone some away to informing older adults about who drinks most in later life.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>AE4050F2-CE43-4C92-A16C-2E62C9F0D054</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5608f94fbde7c5.07778693</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare,Retail</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project revealed new findings about the relationship between alcohol consumption, life course events associated with partnership status and health, and individual resources in later life. The analysis used the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing which provided data on alcohol consumption and life events over a ten year period (approximately 2000-2010) for a sample of 2046 men and 2692 women aged 45 and over. We considered how both the quantity and frequency of drinking varied for different groups of older people at the beginning of the period of observation and changes in drinking behaviour other time.
 
The findings confirmed that older men tend to drink more and to drink more often than women. For both men and women, those in the highest income group and with highest level of education drank more and drank more frequently. Of particular interest was the relationship between partnership status and drinking. Men who were not in a partnership drank more compared to men with a partner at the baseline, though there was no difference in the frequency of men's drinking by partnership status. For women being in a partnership did not influence drinking behaviours at the baseline, though over the ten year period loss of a partner was associated with a faster decline in weekly alcohol consumption and with drinking less often. This demonstrates that being in a partnership moderates how much older men drink but this was not found for women's consumption. This new finding reveals the importance of understanding the social context of drinking. This finding could be explored further using individual case histories.

The analysis also considered the relationship between drinking and health. There is considerable medical and popular interest in the possibility that moderate alcohol consumption may be associated with better health in later life, while not drinking and heavy consumption are associated with worse health. Using the longitudinal data we explored the association between changes in drinking and health. The analysis found that over time older people with poor health and deteriorating health reported a steeper decline in the quantity and frequency of alcohol consumed. This finding supports the assumption that older people moderate their drinking in response to health events, in other words health status influences how much older people drink. We suggest that the observation that drinking in later life is associated with better health does not necessarily support the assumption that drinking is good for you, but that consumption is dependent on health status. Understanding how health moderates drinking in later life is an important area for further research which could consider the importance of medical advice about drinking, taking medications and whether deteriorating health limits the social opportunities for drinking.

One additional finding relating to health and drinking is that older people who stopped drinking at the start of the period of observation and remained in the study were more likely to experience an improvement in health compared to drinkers. This suggests that while older people might reduce consumption in response to declining health, for some this reduction may lead to an improvement in health conditions.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings will be of interest to public health practitioners providing alcohol support services for older people and we have already been contacted by one local authority (Dorset County Council). The findings confirm that while the majority of older people drink moderately, or not at all, there are some groups that do drink more. Our findings suggest that the group most at risk of heavy drinking in later life are older men, not in a partnership with high levels of education and above average wealth. Targeting this group is not necessarily straight forward as these men might not necessarily identify their drinking as a problem behaviour. Moreover this group are more likely to experience good health hence the need for any immediate intervention might not be apparent. Our findings also challenge the assumption that the end of a partnership is associated with alcohol misuse in later life, which has been found in qualitative studies. In particular our analysis of drinking behaviours demonstrates that change in partnership status for women is associated with a reduction in consumption. Hence it is not necessarily appropriate to target alcohol services at this group of older people.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>52BE6874-AB9E-4C54-87AF-6D4D3C1A66E5</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>545171f5631907.54805991</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.keele.ac.uk/drinkinglaterlife/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Citation in Drink wise, Age Well publication</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A17F4CDD-7C8E-4BE8-8275-C4F5FEE20AE1</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58c1340fc8a527.09696368</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.ilcuk.org.uk/index.php/publications/publication_details/drink_wise_age_well_alcohol_use_and_the_over_50s_in_the_uk</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Contribution to Drinkaware campaign on middle age male drinkers</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7EAF1484-29BF-4A5F-8C01-E4F2BEB4711A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>56d8b4afd76a38.53022085</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>4085244F-3CA7-4D2B-A614-ADD62FE90922</gtr:id><gtr:title>Is regular drinking in later life an indicator of good health?
