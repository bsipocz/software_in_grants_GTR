Primarily mitochondria are responsible for generating chemical 'energy' that is used for fundamental processes like muscle movement, respiration and heart function, but they are also involved in processes like signal transmission in the brain and generating body heat. Due to their central role in these important processes, poor functioning mitochondria have been implicated in a wide range of diseases such as Parkinson's disease, diabetes and cancer, with high-energy tissues such as the brain often being the most affected. As a consequence, understanding the biological processes taking place in the mitochondria across tissues is key to human health.

Alongside genetic material (DNA) that is present in the nucleus, which provides the blueprint for life, mitochondria also have their own DNA. This genetic code provides information to create proteins that are required for mitochondria to generate cellular energy. Before these proteins can be utilized, mitochondrial DNA is converted to RNA (expression of the gene), which is then processed in different ways before being translated into proteins. The steps converting mitochondrial DNA into proteins are complex, multi-staged and at all points rely on genes that are coded in the nuclear genome. As a result, there are strong relationships between the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes: mutations in the nuclear genome are known to cause mitochondrial disorders. Although we understand a great deal about the nuclear genes involved in mitochondrial processes, there is still a lack of understanding of all stages of the molecular processes influencing mitochondrial function, and we are lacking a catalogue of common genetic mutations carried by healthy individuals that can influence the levels of expression of mitochondrial genes and the processing of mitochondrial RNA. 

In this study we will use novel techniques to quantify the expression levels of mitochondrial genes across a large number of individuals and in many different tissue types, therefore creating a frame of reference for all future studies interested in comparing mitochondrial RNA levels in healthy and diseased individuals. Using this data we will then identify genetic variation in the nuclear genome that is associated with variation in mitochondrial gene expression and test whether this genetic variation is only important in certain tissues, or whether it acts across the entire human body. Following this, we will compare the genetic variation we identify as being associated with mitochondrial gene expression to databases of the features and annotations of the human genome, as well as catalogues of mutations linked to disease. In this way, we will attempt to understand the mechanisms by which mitochondrial gene expression is regulated and whether these processes may help researchers to understand the underlying causes of disease.

Studying these processes in healthy individuals will allow us to identify genes that are important in the normal functioning of mitochondria, but will also create a list of target genes (and mutations) that may become dysfunctional in some individuals and are therefore important for the study of diseases. Since mitochondria tend to be more important in high-energy tissues such as the heart and brain, understanding if these processes vary in different tissues will be key to inferring the potential impacts on human health. Finally, genes and genetic mutations identified here may identify biological processes that are important in ageing, since poor functioning mitochondria are one hallmark of the ageing process, and could also highlight nuclear genes associated with mitochondrial function that are important to study in the context of three-parent embryos.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Although transcription and processing of the mitochondrial genome are important for human health, mitochondrial RNA is vastly understudied at a population scale. Nuclear gene expression correlates with mitochondrial gene expression, highlighting the strong links between the two genomes, yet there is a lack of understanding of how genetic variation modulates interactions between the two genomes. In this project we will:

1. Quantify mitochondrial gene expression levels across individuals and tissues using over 13,000 pre-existing RNA sequencing datasets across 18 different tissues. We will map and filter sequencing data and quantify mitochondrial transcript abundances within bespoke pipelines designed to analyze mitochondria specific data. We will compare data across individuals/tissues using multi-dimensional scaling, hierarchical clustering and statistical tests.

2. Identify novel mitochondrial RNA cleavage events using data described above, within which we will test for an enrichment of read starts/ends stacking at particular positions along the mitochondrial genome. We will quantify cleavage rates within each sample and then test for differences across individuals and tissues.

3. Identify common nuclear genetic variation associated with changes in mitochondrial gene expression (trans-eQTLs) and RNA cleavage rates. We will perform genome-wide association tests using matched nuclear genotyping data.

4. Identify broad and tissue specific eQTLs by formally comparing regression coefficients between nuclear genetic variation and mitochondrial gene expression and RNA phenotypes across different tissues (gene-by-tissue interaction effects).

5. Fine map identified nuclear genetic variation using whole genome sequencing data for a subset of samples used for original association tests, and functionally characterize identified SNPs by formally testing for overlaps with genome annotations, nuclear eQTLs and GWAS hits.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>We have identified four areas of potential impact for this research project:
1. Increasing the economic benefit of existing and future funds spent on large sequencing projects by training world-class bioinformaticians that can analyse complex data.
2. Increasing knowledge of young people in the applications of computational biology and inspiring students to study science and computational subjects at UK universities.
3. Creating bespoke analysis pipelines that could be utilised in a clinical setting.
4. Identify genes linked to mitochondrial function that may improve understanding of the processes driving mitochondrial disease.

We aim to maximise the potential impact of our research in these areas through three main strands of activity:

1. Training of world-class bioinformaticians to increase the benefit of funds spent on large sequencing projects and enhance the societal benefits of genome science. We will recruit and train a postdoctoral researcher who will be trained in bioinformatic analysis of complex, multi-dimensional -omics data and mitochondrial biology. They will also develop their skills within eMedLab training academies, which will hold regular workshops and retreats, have access to transferable skills straining through King's College London's 'SkillsForge' and will mentor more junior scientists within the laboratory. The rapid expansion of genomics data through initiatives such as the 100,000 Genomes Project will create an urgent need for highly trained bioinformaticians and as such we will deliver training and skills that maximise the economic viability of such projects and enhances the global reputation of UK science. 

2. Engaging key stage 3/4 students to inspire future science leaders and increase the number of students studying science and computational subjects at UK universities. We will embark on generating a series of lectures on the bigger picture findings from our work on mitochondria that can be delivered in local UK schools. The lectures aim to highlight the societal benefits of such research to students, improve their understanding of how computational analyses are used in biomedicine, spark interest in genomic techniques and ultimately encourage students to consider studying science and computational subjects in Higher Education. We will aim to deliver lectures in two schools, and in the Francis Crick Institute's 'open lab area', with an aim of engaging over 100 young people. Genomics is a rapidly growing area and the demand for understanding scientific ideas and results generated from these kinds of data is growing amongst the general public.

3. Impacting clinical management and understanding of mitochondrial diseases through the creation and dissemination of bespoke analysis pipelines and the communication of results with mitochondrial disease charities. We will communicate a list of genes and genetic variation associated with mitochondrial processes through publication and associated media events, through the online database 'Mitomap', which has large global audience of researchers and clinicians, and via the Lilly Foundation, a mitochondrial diseases charity that could filter results to researchers working on mitochondrial conditions through well-established networks. The project will also generate bespoke pipelines for the analysis of mitochondrial gene expression from RNA sequencing data, which will be uploaded to 'Github', an open access repository commonly used to host software and analysis projects that currently has &amp;gt;25 million users. This will immediately benefit the research community, but - crucially - it will create a framework through which analysis could be performed in a clinical setting. Although RNA analysis is generally more variable than DNA analysis, due to temporal and tissue specific profiles, biological information contained within this type of data may further enrich diagnostics.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2018-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>326406</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/R006075/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C23BE70F-1EF6-4CC7-88B0-841CB18DD875</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Genetics &amp; development</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>CC10CC12-1D16-48BD-8F66-6A64A651DEAB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Gene action &amp; regulation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A4209D5A-2E41-4290-9D1A-3172C1F48962</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Population Genetics/Evolution</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
