&lt;p>The project centres on food vendors' pricing practices used to drive higher sales volumes but which may encourage consumers to overbuy for their needs, leading to consumer overeating or throwing away food.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Such pricing techniques include offers couched in terms of bargain prices for buying more food.&amp;nbsp; For example, restaurants offer customers larger food portions for little extra cost, free refills on soft drinks, two meals for the price of one, and all-you-can-eat buffets for a set price.&amp;nbsp;Similarly, supermarkets make extensive use of multiple-unit pricing offers such as &amp;quot;three for the price of two&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;buy one get one free&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;BOGOF&amp;quot;).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The research provides theoretical and empirical analysis on whether and to what extent such offers are beneficial or harmful from an economic and social perspective with the purpose of providing fresh insights for the current policy debate on how best to tackle these two great social problems.&lt;br />&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>54228</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Participant in panel discussion for 30 minute TV programme about obesity and sugary food consumption shown on Mustard TV</gtr:description><gtr:form>A broadcast e.g. TV/radio/film/podcast (other than news/press)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3BD3803E-2E22-4E85-B187-5F53717FE3BF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A 30-minute TV programme called &amp;quot;This Week&amp;quot; shown on Mustard TV at 7:30pm on Thursday 21st January 2016, as a panel show with three expert participants (of which Professor Paul Dobson was one of them) discussing the British Heart Foundation finding that 31% of children leaving primary school in the East of England are obese or overweight, and their call for a ban on adverts for unhealthy foods prior to 9pm and a 'sugar tax.'

Price promotions can offer great savings for consumers. BUT...while the deals are good for our wallets, are they good for our waistlines and health? Do supermarkets over promote unhealthy foods and encourage excessive consumption? Are special offers fuelling the UK's obesity epidemic? 

This lecture examines these concerns and presents new evidence on the nature of supermarket price promotions.

As a result of the positive feedback from this presentation as an inaugural lecture, I was invited to repeat and adapt the same lecture for (I) an academic seminar to the ESRC Centre for Competition Policy at the University of East Anglia, (ii) presenting a lecture to a public audience in London hosted by the University of East Anglia, (iii) presenting a lecture to a public audience in Norwich as part of the University of East Anglia's 50th Anniversary celebrations, and (iv) presenting an invited talk to Tesco senior managers in corporate social responsibility at the headquarters of Tesco PLC</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>r-5542082819.6612022b06304a</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.uea.ac.uk/mac/comm/media/press/2012/November/supermarkets-offers-paul-dobson</gtr:url><gtr:year>2011</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Contribution to Telegraph newspaper article on &quot;How did Britain get so Fat?&quot; published on 26 February 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7111CA9A-BA7D-4329-9887-DB43E4DCA8D6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Contribution to a Telegraph newspaper article written by Tom Rowley and Ashley Kirk, titled &amp;quot;How did Britain get so fat?&amp;quot; and published on Friday 26 February 2016. The article quotes Professor Dobson and the research findings of the ESRC project: 'According to a 2011 study by the University of East Anglia, supermarkets are more likely to promote unhealthy foods. Foods on special offer were 20 percent more likely to have red &amp;quot;traffic light&amp;quot; labels for high sugar and 50 percent more likely to have the same designation for high fat than non-promoted products. &amp;quot;Often the most frequently promoted products are high in combinations of concerning constituents such as fresh desserts and chocolate, which have high levels of both sugar and fat,&amp;quot; said Prof Paul Dobson, head of the university's Norwich Business School.' In addition, the article provides an infographic representation of evidence drawn from the ESRC study on which unhealthy food products are highly price promoted.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56debe3b9e6d59.38036280</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Media (as a channel to the public)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://s.telegraph.co.uk/graphics/projects/fat-Britain-obesity/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The research project has demonstrated how the way that food sellers price difference units or amounts of food, encouraging consumers to buy more rather than less, can result in socially-harmful excessive food purchases that encourage consumers to eat too much or waste food not consumed. The first immediate impact has been to raise public awareness of this problem and the dissemination of the project findings through the national press and broadcast media, as well as other forums like public lectures, has helped serve this purpose. 

More direct impact has been made through discussions with industry participants. Here the challenge is finding win-win solutions that benefit the public as well as the industry participants. As an illustration, Tesco, as the UK's leading supermarket retailer, has made a move towards adapting the use of multi-buy special offers on highly perishable fresh salad products in a way that is less likely to result in food waste of such products, such as using offers like &amp;quot;buy one get one later&amp;quot;, where a voucher is provided to the customer so that they do not need to take the addition &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; product at the time of purchase but can pick it up on another date - which benefits the shopper in reducing waste but also the retailer by encouraging the shopper to come back to the store. This research project and the discussions with managers at Tesco PLC provides support and encouragement for the use of such innovative pricing practices which can deliver win-win solutions but just as importantly makes them aware that the disclosure of our findings in raising public awareness will impact on consumer behaviour and result in negative sentiment unless actions are taken to alleviate the problem of pricing in a way that steers consumers to excessive and wasteful food purchasing.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>0D7A12D5-B20D-47BC-AD54-0F5FD67B8A4C</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>54687d5754b0a6.27247569</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Retail</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The research has made both theoretical and empirical contributions to our understanding as to why the pricing of food and particularly the use of special offers to encourage purchases in greater volumes in supermarkets, restaurants and other food vendors may contribute to excessive food purchasing by consumers that results in excessive eating (so exacerbating health and social problems relating to obesity) or food waste (so exacerbating environmental costs of disposing of wasted food in landfill sites).
