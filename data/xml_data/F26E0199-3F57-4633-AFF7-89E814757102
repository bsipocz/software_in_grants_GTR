Economy</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/K037293/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>BESiDE's research asks the question: How can the built environment facilitate physical activity and wellbeing in care homes? Our goal is to transform the network of stakeholders involved in care environments into a virtuous cycle of design improvement, in which architects, professional bodies, academics, policy makers, charities, and care home providers are all motivated to pursue improvement in the built environment for older adults. 

With changes in population demographics resulting in a growing number of care homes, economic, health and ethical considerations demand that attention be directed to effective means of creating an enabling built environment to provide older adults with healthy and socially fulfilling lives. This research addresses a significant knowledge gap focussed on measures to mitigate problems and enhance the experience of older people within the built environment.
 
A fundamental impact of ageing is that a person's needs and abilities change; however, the built environment is failing to respond to these changes. Despite current legislative statutes and design guidance, little is known from empirical evidence (generated by older people, their family and care providers) about enabling and disabling elements of the built environment. These elements have never been defined to support the advancement of building and digital technology design. Through systematic analysis of the failings and successes of older people's care environments, BESiDE research will identify how better-informed building design can facilitate greater mobility, physical activity, social connectedness and wellbeing of older people. BESiDE's aims are to: 

1) Actively involve and inform professional practices of architecture and design through research focussed on failings and successes of the built environment (internal and external) across the experience of ageing.

2) Impact professional practice through developing digital technologies within the built environment to promote greater mobility, improved quality of life, physical activity and connectivity of older people. 

3) Inform policy, through BESiDE's Advisory Board and Project Partners, as to what designs and digital interventions encourage activity and how these can be engineered to facilitate increased wellbeing in older people.

Collaboration across disciplines of computing, architecture, healthcare, medicine of old age and design will drive this work forward and build the UK's capability in supporting older people within the built environment. Engagement with older people and stakeholders will shape understanding of barriers to wellbeing within the built environment.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research addresses critical challenges facing designers of the built environment; particularly older people's care environments. Through a multi-faceted analysis of environments specifically designed for older people, BESiDE will provide a practical, usable and holistic understanding of design for wellbeing, ageing, and long-term mobility for use within the general context of the built environment. To effect this transformation and to achieve impact, the BESiDE team has planned targeted activities. Within the context of care homes, BESiDE's Impact Aims are to: 

1. Train professionals as to better design of the built environment (internal and external) for ageing.

2. Inform policy change as to what built environment designs encourage activity and how these can be engineered to facilitate increased wellbeing in older people.

Train Built Environment Professionals
-------------------------------------
Our findings will be disseminated to the professional community through design briefs, a design toolkit, a series of professional training and demonstration days, and workshops. Registered Architects are required to undertake 35 hours of Continual Practice Development (CPD) training per year for their professional accreditation. CPD training is used to aid architects in gaining skills, knowledge and awareness, with the ultimate aim of incorporating new work practices to build their business. BESiDE will contribute to this development, initiating a training seminar for the current and next generation of architects through a Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) validated CPD program. The findings of BESiDE will directly contribute to core RIBA curriculum topics and provide essential knowledge that will give architects and designers the insight to create enabling environments while preventing future expensive retrofits when buildings fail to meet the needs of older users.


Inform Policy Change
--------------------
In addition to private care home providers who are constantly assessing how to enhance their environments, the wellbeing of older people is a vitally important issue for policy across health, housing and social care, and local authorities. We will host demonstration days for policy makers, health and social practitioners and providers. This impact will be measured by tracking our interactions with government and policy makers, the engagement of these stakeholders in BESiDE's demonstration days and Advisory Board, and specific policy citations to BESiDE findings. 


Expert Advisors
---------------
To ensure that these activities have the desired impact, we have assembled a consortium of Expert Advisors from the professional communities we plan to address. Confirmed members of our Advisory Board include three representatives from Architecture, including a Consultant from the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA); four members representing Care professionals, including managers from our care home Project Partners, and a person from the Care Inspectorate; a Clinical professional, a Professor in Health Care Research, who works to enable quality research in care homes; a senior industry researcher working in the healthcare domain; and two Government representatives with interests in ageing and healthcare.

In addition to these Advisory Board members, BESiDE will ensure strong input from older adults, seeking input from residents of care home, members of our university panel of older adults, and representatives from charitable organisations that work with older adults.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1301189</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Newcastle University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>School of Computing Science</gtr:department><gtr:description>BESiDE Advisory Board</gtr:description><gtr:id>5D3C88DD-1596-4742-B37B-16F8586361E5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The board have been critical in steering the research and also in ensuring the work is targeted towards impact.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cb3e6e67fc74.25417494-6</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partnerContribution>Our advisory board members are experts in one of the key stakeholder groups informing our research.

Audience feedback was focused on aspects of care home lifestyle that they had not thought of previously. People discussed how the built environment was important for residents to manage their personal way of life within communal living. They were interested in the ways in which different types of seating and different spaces could improve their ability to visit in a care home.

Scottish Care Bulletin is distributed to every care home in Scotland as the main newsletter for care workers. This briefing paper reported on early findings from interviews with visitors to care homes. It highlights key themes from 13 interviews in which visitors report on how important building and design can be in creating an environment which supports a homely atmosphere for their residents. The paper points to the importance of visitors and how welcome they find a choice of visiting spaces, which allow for privacy when necessary, as well as their overall desire to have a home that supports relaxed behaviour, common in a domestic setting.

The User Pool is comprised of individuals who volunteered to help research into the digital exclusion of older adults and of people with disabilities. 

The BESiDE team had a booth which displayed a poster of findings from interviews with visitors to care homes as well as the results of novel Co-design work including artefacts from our working methods, a poster and a power point presentation to encourage people to stop and chat with the researchers. The SiDE User Pool was used to recruit participants for both of these research activities.

Its impact aims are to provide information for professionals on better design of the built environment (internal and external) for ageing. This is focussed around three areas: 

1. Built-Environment Professionals who are designing these environments. Towards this goal, talks and publications have been directed at professional magazines, conferences, and exhibit venues geared towards architects and other built environment professionals. Our BESiDE Advisory Board, which includes architects, has been instrumental in pointing us towards such opportunities.

2. The Care Provision Industry who are procuring, managing, maintaining and operating care home environments. Towards this goal, talks and publications have been directed at magazines and workshops geared to care industry professionals. Our BESiDE Advisory Board, which includes representatives from care homes and government care home regulatory entities, has been instrumental in making connections for us with these stakeholders. Our research interactions at individual care homes have produced unanticipated impact, with one of the homes adopting a craft programme modelled after our methods.

3. Policy. BESiDE also has as a goal to inform policy change as to what built environment designs encourage activity and how these can be engineered to facilitate increased wellbeing in older people. Through our Advisory Board, we have engaged with policy at the level of the Scottish government.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>25516B23-BB08-4DB8-906C-D722FDD1513F</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>546233a7992f75.52956456</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Construction,Creative Economy,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Activities in BESiDE have generated findings across all the areas of the research and publications are still in process in many areas of this work.
- How to design and build automated, cloud-based analysis and visualisation for activity and location data
- Interviews with care home users (residents, staff, and visitors) have captured the priorities as seen from the eyes of visitors and residents. 
- Observational studies uncovered information about the spatial demands imposed by the everyday life of a care home. This work identified built environment design qualities which support opportunities for wellbeing among care home residents. 
- Interviews and questionnaires with built-environment professionals have contributed a review of knowledge exchange methods within the context of built-environment design for older adults. 
- Software development to facilitate architects' conversations with clients regarding built-environment needs for facilitating health and wellbeing in a care home has so far resulted in prototype software. This software is awaiting usability tests to be tested by architects. 
- Designers working with Co-design methods have developed a methodology to enable people (designers, engineers, technologists or clinicians) to engage empathetically with care home residents in personalising off-the shelf wearables or monitoring devices (for research) that are appropriate for them
- An accelerometery based study across a cohort of care homes has established a baseline of physical activity levels amongst this population. It has determined differences with analogous community dwelling populations, further highlighting the need for novel approaches to increasing activity participation in care home populations. 
- The testing of location sensing technologies has been extensive and has informed research on activity traces of care home residents.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We anticipate that the findings will be beneficial in:

1. Providing information to architects and those working in the care home industry on better design of the built environment (internal and external) for ageing; 

2. Informing as to what built environment designs encourage activity and how these can be engineered to facilitate increased wellbeing in older people, 

3. Sparking new research and activity promoting empowering users to personalise their own health devices lead to better adoption and appropriation rates, and

4.
