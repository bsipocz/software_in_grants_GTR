A collaboration between researchers, information professionals, technologists, curators and historians, the aim is to build a portal that gives researchers the freedom to explore the depth of detail held in British design archives. Produced as part of an investigation into researcher behaviours, and co-designed with researchers, the project will be underpinned by technical integrity and data quality aligned to user needs and requirements. Its functionality and design will bring about a step change in the understanding of archival research and in design research possibilities in digital environments. More than a tool to access material online, it is an enquiry into 'ways of thinking with digital processes.' (Drucker 2013: 7) 

This project will break down barriers between information professionals, curators and researchers. The ever increasing complexity of the Web and digital content demands a clearer cross-sector recognition of different perspectives. Researchers need to understand what is possible with structured metadata in order to improve their own research capacity and to provide informed input into digital developments. This project proposes a move away from a model where curators and information professionals provide services, and researchers consume them, to a co-design model where researchers have a greater stake in digital humanities infrastructure.

Archival collections provide us with a means to understand the particularities and complexities of design's history. This project argues that these unique collections need to be viewed and interpreted within the rich context that informs their understanding and interpretation. Archive collections are multi-level resources, reflecting complex relationships. Descriptions of archives are therefore hierarchical in order to reflect the way each archive is assembled. Traditional routes through descriptions descend from the collection-level down through series to individual items, be they documents, photographs, plans or drawings. This practice comes from the principle that researchers take a pre-defined route through content but this project will create a more dynamic navigation, across collections at different levels rather than the traditional top down approach. To enable this, we will build context and connections through the creation of rich authority descriptions that are designed to work with the Web and which adopt recently-agreed international standards. These descriptions are about much more than unambiguous identification; they are essentially about relationships and connections; they can provide a means to connect individuals and organisations together through establishing specific relationships and documenting key events. Connected to other key access points such as companies, exhibitions, design disciplines, objects, and materials, the Virtual International Authority File is a mechanism to connect sources across the world. 

The project will present new research potential for design historical scholarship by conjoining data from disparate archive sources nationally and internationally, and secondly, it will provoke better understanding of archival data when encoded and arranged in digital environments as a key, yet overlooked, skill in digital humanities research practice. It will expose and debate the relationship between the original artefact and its digital surrogate, and the construction of the information architecture in which it sits. At the same time it will be a means for archivists to understand more about the research experience, and how approaches to cataloguing might change in order to to meet the needs of researchers and take advantage of new developments within the World Wide Web.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>History of design research at Brighton has pioneered new methods of analysis and practices of interpretation to transform understandings of how design is produced, marketed and consumed. It has changed the ways in which international organisations representing the design professions regard and value their history, and it has shaped the study and public appreciation of the history of design worldwide. As such, it is the ideal base for a collaborative Digital Transformation Amplification project that seeks to devise new ways to explore Britain's design history. 

1. Museum and Archive visitors/citizen scholars
Visitors to museum and archive websites will, via links to the Exploring British Design portal, discover new ways to engage with and understand Britain's design history. They will also experience and learn about archival structures and the way design history if represented in digital environments.

2. Public and private sector information managers including archivists, museum collections managers, librarians, and technical innovators.
Archivists and information professionals will have a toolkit to consult when considering the adoption themselves of the recently-agreed international standard for authority files. 
The project will contribute to the critical mass of authority files accessible to archival and information professions worldwide.
The project process will be documented on the 'For Archivists' section of the Archives Hub website.

3. Designers - sense of their past and professional identity 
The design profession will, through access to the portal, have the opportunity to gain a deep understanding of the profession's past and its contribution to national cultural and economic life, all elements that can inform their own identity formation and future value. The project will be promoted through professional organisations and through industry publications (Design Week) and membership networks (CSD/Icograda etc).

4. Public Institutions - Royal Society of Arts, museums, art schools, universities. 
The portal will support and bolster the UK's heritage profile by revealing the riches of UK HE resources and those in other repositories. 
The Design Museum will benefit from a mechanism to enrich the visitor experience beyond the actual objects or items on display by revealing a wealth of additional contextual material.
Museum curators will have a new means to conduct research for collection documentation and exhibitions.

5. European and Global communities
The project will reveal socially relevant knowledge and contribute to design literacy (EU report), and so potentially EU citizens widely. A significant number of designers to be represented emigrated from various European countries and so their biographies establish direct connections to places, people and institutions in Europe. 
5% of authority files will pertain to designers born or educated in Britain who are represented in the RMIT Design Archive, Melbourne with the intention of paving the way for further global reach and impact. 

6. Project participants
All researcher participants in the workshops will gain an understanding of cross-sector working, co-design processes, and the potential of digital technologies. They will gain an understanding of transferable research skills that will inform their own research endeavours and their employability.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>62891</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Paper given at the conference of the International Confederation of Architectural Museums (icam17), 2014</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9B77BE10-CBEC-470E-963E-5CCFD1DAE52F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Exploring British Design was discussed by Catherine Moriarty as part of a paper co-presented with Professor Harriet Edquist of RMIT, Melbourne entitled 'Curating Design Archives data for research collaboration', part of icam17 at Columbia University, 2014.

It enabled the testing of a new data standard in a live situation for the first time in the UK. It developed the relationship between the Archives Hub and the international name authority portals VIAF, and also with Europeana and the Archives Portal Europe. Discussions with researchers as part of the three workshops in Brighton, Manchester and London, informed not only this project but also the redesign of the Archives Hub public user-interface. The prototype is permanently accessible on the Jisc website and available to the 275,000+ users of the Archives Hub who have an opportunity to see how the model might work in other contexts or subject areas. It is also incorporated as a resource within the web pages of the Design Archives.
The project demonstrated that true digital transformation is the result of content development, resource delivery evolution, and behavioural modification of both users, custodians and service-providers.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>2B37540E-712A-4082-8AA6-321F810B7798</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5464974e544ea8.60710846</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project and its prototype web resource has brought home the need for the 'connective turn' to be discussed at all levels of research, and with a wide range of people from museum staff and visitors, to data services and developers, and far beyond the sense of digital humanities as a discrete field of inquiry. We embarked on this project with an existing data service (the Archives Hub) in order to work in a real rather than hypothetical context. Although we only set out to create a prototype it has a permanent home within the Archives Hub pages as an example of how archive data can be transformed through connection and visualisation, and through co-production. We wanted to explore the possibilities of archival descriptions and related datasets that revealed design heritage in new ways, and we found that the quality and consistency of the data was a very substantial factor in what could be achieved. This is maybe not so much a lesson learnt, as another confirmation of how innovation is so completely affected by the data available; data often created before the computer age, and certainly before the advent of the Web. It is this kind of information that curators and archivists have been compiling for generations; it is a national asset that should be declared and revealed in new forms. The project also makes clear the importance of investing in the expertise of UK data developers and digitally engaged academics, in order to build sustainable project outcomes that accrue and evolve cross-sector.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The Archives Hub has been able to use the experience gained throughout this project to inform the data model for its new system and to provide ideas that will enhance the presentation of data to researchers. Thus, Exploring British Design is informing and will continue to inform the architecture and the user-interface, to the benefit of the 280 UK archives that contribute to the service. 
The Design Museum wishes to collaborate on further resource-development and collection-linking initiatives, and discussions at Exploring British Design meetings and workshops are informing thinking about future research engagement strategy.
The researchers involved have developed a wish to explore the visualisation of historical data in more detail and to consider how this enhances the research experience of users. It is an area ripe for enquiry and the charts 'visualising relationships' in Exploring British Design have enormous potential for elaboration and development. Indeed, the researchers and many participants in the project would welcome an opportunity to develop the prototype further, allowing new and extended linkages to other archival sources to be established, and in order to create a sense of dynamism and accrual. Working on the project made it apparent that investigating the relationships of celebrated designers allows lesser-known 'lost to history' designers to be brought to the fore - providing fruitful data for further exploration. We promised in our bid that we would 'devise a proof of concept that could be deployed on a global scale' and we now seek opportunities to work towards this.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>76AF90AF-EDAC-43AA-A406-6A7AC9FE3891</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>546497f1bd1557.42583988</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://exploredesign.archiveshub.ac.uk</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Designers often work together but histories of design tend to focus on individuals rather than the relationships between them. This prototype website has been built to show the connections between people, events and organisations. It suggests what might be revealed when information is connected and visualised in new ways.

The prototype comprises detailed information about 61 designers, 8 organisations and 1 event. It serves to show how these 'entities' are connected. It also links to over 800 other people, organisations and events related to them in some way. The website makes a showcase of the Things in Their Home Setting section of the Britain Can Make It exhibition, providing photographs and descriptions of each of its 23 Furnished Rooms, identifying designers and manufacturers associated with each room and its contents.

The initial intention was to use the new archival XML format, EAC-CPF, and to explore it as a basis for creating 'name authority records', but we found that a domain specific standard had some limitations in terms of the interconnectivity that we wanted to achieve. This meant that we utilised EAC, but also moved beyond the standard, to a more fluid solution based upon the principles of RDF. The creation of a web interface evolved over time, partly in response to the workshops that were held with researchers, and partly as a result of technical and data challenges that we encountered. 

The site demonstrates how connected data allows researchers to explore complex relationships within British design history. It reveals how this history includes a wider cast of characters than we might have expected, how it connects different fields of interest and professional expertise, and how its legacy is shared across many regional and national museums and archives.</gtr:description><gtr:id>F8CFB18B-3163-4C86-9F0B-F658FE1B7A5E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Archives Hub has been able to use the experience gained throughout this project to inform the data model for its new system and to provide ideas that will enhance the presentation data to researchers. Thus, Exploring British Design is informing and will continue to inform the architecture and the user-interface, to the benefit of the 280 UK archives that contribute to the service. 
The Design Museum wishes to collaborate on further resource-development and collection-linking initiatives, and discussions at Exploring British Design events are informing thinking about future research engagement strategy.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56c49870c848f2.05584076</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Exploring British Design</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://exploredesign.archiveshub.ac.uk.</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>D271A5ED-1520-4113-9687-E8ABF4F476BB</gtr:id><gtr:title>Monographs, Archives, and Networks: Representing Designer Relationships</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Design Issues</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/abf3cafbb7daadd8ecb78e2c48e4dff1"><gtr:id>abf3cafbb7daadd8ecb78e2c48e4dff1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Moriarty C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56c6fb4accd549.00534152</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>82A69C24-C23C-4A94-AFFA-C646221C1E88</gtr:id><gtr:title>Creating Exploring British Design: a prototype website exploring linked data, an entity-based approach and collection enhancement</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>ARC Magazine</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/ad94b28801f75d1e8a40b90f91069c19"><gtr:id>ad94b28801f75d1e8a40b90f91069c19</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kisby, A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>56c6fd778686e4.69486524</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/M002438/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>608431EA-925E-44D8-A1E2-8C24B4768085</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9E4BDAC2-CD51-4625-BCC1-5F768EE168D0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Design HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
