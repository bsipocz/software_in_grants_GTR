In the space of a decade, however, Hull's interest in catching fish contracted dramatically as the restrictions imposed by the Common Fisheries Policy (1972), the increase in fuel prices during the oil crises of 1973 and 1974, and the extension of Iceland's territorial limits to 200 miles in 1976 combined to undermine the trawling industry's viability. By the mid-1980s, Hull had virtually disposed of its trawling fleet, which had for decades been one of the largest and most productive in Europe.\n\nThe research will assess the extent to which the contraction of the distant-water trawling industry from c. 1970 impacted upon the social and economic profile of Hull, and upon the cultural geographies of the city as the tightly-clustered fishing community and associated groups of West Hull were dispersed by economic change and local planning policies to clear the area's slum housing. In particular, the study will consider how the these changes impacted upon the perceptions of the city and its histories amongst the former fishing communities, other groups in Hull and the more formal, 'official' articulations of Hull's identity. It will also address how Hull's social memories of this industry and its legacies have been contested and re-worked subsequently. This will improve our understanding of the influence of the trawling industry on Hull's social and cultural complexion, the ways in which Hull's trawling past has shaped its image in the gaze of those who live in 'trawlertown' and people from elsewhere, and the representation of the fisheries in the past, present and future displays of Hull Maritime Museum. \n\nIn focusing on an industry that experienced rapid, profound change, the research will assess the strategies adopted by the various agencies engaged in trawling. While some groups left the business, others moved abroad to work in different fisheries, and others diversified into fish processing, merchanting and retailing. The success or otherwise of such adaptive strategies has contemporary relevance in a period of economic recession, especially in Hull, which tends to suffer more than most areas from commercial downturns. A further aspect of the study will be the recollections of those involved in Hull's trawling industry since the 1960s. Trawler owners, trawler skippers, 'deckies', technical experts, local politicians and development agency personnel will be interviewed to gauge the views of the 'fishing community' on the major transformations of their businesses, upon their formerly tight-knit community, and upon their subsequent changes to lifestyle, identity and memory away from the spatial concentration around the fishing dock. \n\nHull Maritime Museum is the most important civic articulation of this industry, its communities and their histories. The Maritime Museum aims to re-work its permanent exhibition on the distant-water trawling industry in the next few years. First, they need to establish what themes and topics are elided in their current exhibit and collections, and which additional themes should be included or re-emphasised in the re-vamped exhibition. This research will therefore find direct application in the representation of Hull's distant-water trawling industry, to its associated social and cultural geographies, and to the continuing issues of memory and commemoration that surrounds this community and their lost industry. In the shorter-term, this research will be accessible to the public through the project website, and it will form the basis of a temporary exhibition to be held at Hull Maritime Museum in the course of t</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from the research?\n1. Local people and community groups in Hull\n2. Hull Maritime Museum\n3. Hull's Archival Service\n4. Businesses in the Humber fish trade\n\n\nHow will they benefit?\n1. Local people (from schoolchildren to retirees) and community groups in Hull will be provided with opportunities to learn about, identify with and celebrate a significant facet of their heritage. \n\n2. The research findings will inform the exhibitions and interpretive work of Hull Maritime Museum.\n\n3. The contemporary relevance of historical archives, and how they can enrich people's lives, will be demonstrated by the utilisation of a range of evidence - documentary records, statistical reports, oral testimony, material culture - in the research process.\n\n4. Research into the ways in which Hull's trawling industry and related concerns adapted to the sudden change in the 1970s and 1980s has the potential to inform contemporary business decisions in a sector that continues to be prone to sudden fluctuation. \n\n\nWhat will be done to ensure that they benefit?\nPlanning: engagement with non-academic audiences will be incorporated into the workplan, specifically through the contribution that the student will make to the activities of Hull Maritime Museum and Hull History Centre (an archival and events centre resulting from a joint initiative of Hull City Council and the University of Hull, which opened in 2010).\nConsultation: the input of the project partner will shape the design of the project.\nStudent recruitment: 'outreach skills' will be included as one of the 'desirable' qualities in the job description to ensure that an appropriately qualified person will be awarded the studentship.\nExperience: the student will be based at the Maritime Historical Studies Centre, and will therefore work in a unit that has a strong track record of engagement with non-academic bodies in the four target audiences, notably: (1) schools and local community groups in Hull; (2) the maritime museums in the UK, the Shetland Museum, the North Sea Maritime Museum Network; (3) the Archives Awareness Campaign launched by the National Archives Council, and Hull History Centre; (4) local businesses in the fish trade through the externally-funded work of one of the MHSC's research associates (Dr Robb Robinson, author of 'Trawling: The Rise and Fall of the British Trawl Fishery' [Exeter UP, 1987]).\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>54250</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I025077/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
