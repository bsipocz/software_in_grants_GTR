in older people</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/L013274/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This proposed project aims to understand how creative interventions help develop connectivity and resilience for older people. This will be achieved through critical reflection on the outcomes from a range of relevant projects across the Connected Communities portfolio such as community gardening, filmmaking, built environment, product design, digital media theatre, music, cultural learning and visual arts interventions for those with early stage dementia. Juxtaposing the results from different projects will result in innovative ways of thinking about resilience and propose solutions to issues raised by community partners. 

Four seminars will be undertaken consisting of presentations, workshops, and breakout sessions. Synthesising learning points from across the Connected Communities portfolio will help draw together the diverse, yet shared issues. Equal Arts, the C.I. and main community partner will recruit a group of older people who will play a full part in the workshops and explore what resilience and connectivity means to them. Researcher participants will also be invited to bring along community partners to ensure discussion is grounded in their lived experience. Policy makers such as Arts Council England will also be involved and part of the management group to ensure that they are part of the process.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The following will benefit from the research, directly or indirectly:
 
Older people who currently engage with the arts and those who do not;
Policy makers such as the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and equivalents in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland;
Arts Council England and their equivalents in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland;
Arts practitioners;
Gallery and museum practitioners, for example BALTIC and Beamish Museum;
Third sector organisations, Age UK Newcastle and North Tyneside, Equal Arts, the Quality of Life Partnership;
Medical profession (including academics, GPs, medical students and care staff);
Arts and health practitioner community; 
Workforce development professionals and employers in the care sector working together to raise the quality of care 
Carers working with older people.

They will benefit from the project in the following ways:

Increasing the effectiveness of public services and policy - this will be achieved through arts policy makers and practitioners having a greater understanding of the role of creative interventions in developing connectivity and resilience in older people informing practice and policy formulation. It is anticipated that the research will make an important contribution to spending decisions within cultural organisations. It will also better evidence the impact cultural practice and research can have on communities, using the language and methods most closely associated with central government and Treasury's Green Book (HMT 2003, O'Brien 2010). Gallery/museum partners will benefit in terms of greater knowledge of how to develop their programmes to foster resilience in older people. It envisaged that networking opportunities will lead to the development of future projects. 

The involvement of researchers, community and voluntary organisations and policy makers all working together will contribute towards developing thinking between health and arts sectors on how engagement with the arts can be seen as a valid part health care. Charities and community groups will be able to use research findings for advocacy purposes. Providing the opportunity for community groups, charities, policy makers and academics to work together over four workshops will help the different sectors understand the requirements of the other(s) - for example, community groups will develop greater understanding of how to frame bids to fulfil policy requirements. Also of significance is the contribution to the evidence base that is required by government to demonstrate the value for money of investments in the arts.

Enhancing quality of life, health and creative output - older people will benefit through the development of creative interventions targeted towards developing connectivity and resilience. This work will contribute to the nation's cultural provision and the wellbeing of older people in the UK. It will facilitate the development of more cost-effective public policy and services. Wider participation amongst older people will reduce social isolation, enabling the development of social networks. 

Research and professional skills - staff working on the project will develop which they could apply in all employment sectors. All participants will develop research and professional skills which they will be able to apply in all employment sectors. The mixture of presentations, break-out sessions and workshops will develop a range of skills and maximise the potential for all to contribute. It is hoped the four workshops will provide a safe atmosphere in which participants can untangle misconceptions, express a lack of understanding, or highlight problems.

It is envisaged that for the practitioners the impact will feed directly into their practice, for the wider arts community the impact will take a little longer, 12-18 months.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-08-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>32279</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Asked to give keynote at Arts and Health Australia's annual conference</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>883632A2-6B10-4BA7-9FEB-3EEAF8412C5B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Approximately 200 delegates attended the conference, including the Governor of Sydney.

Developed a greater dialogue with Arts Council England which may help to inform future evidence-based policy.

You invited me to one of the seminars you ran for your research project focused on older people and I spoke about current and planned activity at the Arts Council. The thought processes that you brought to the day helped my thinking more generally - I remember you rightly pointing out that the data I quoted on engagement levels by age was misleading - people approach to stop engaging quite dramatically from 74 but that doesn't mean the next wave of people who turn 74 will necessarily stop. It could be that the baby boomers will continue engaging longer than the generation before and in fact we can see that happening for the age group 65-74. So - we still have a policy of focussing on people 75 plus but are watching to see if the patterns change as we get annual data in from Taking Part.
 
I also recall sharing with delegates the fact that we were sure if our arts and older peoples work should continue as a stand along area of work or be absorbed into a broader policy around arts and health. You had been working with a group of older people as an advisory panel and they were there as delegates. I remember one woman getting quite emotional and saying - I don't want it to be about health - I want to live. I have quoted this numerous times as we refine our thinking internally and I can honestly say it helped settle the argument once and for all. We are focussing now on ways of giving older people as many opportunities to experiences arts and culture as we can. We are also confident this approach can have health benefits for older people and we aren't ignoring that; but the session helped me to move away from a medical outcomes driven approach - at least when it comes to prioritising ACE funding. Interestingly we are now speaking to Public Health England and again this stand point is helping us negotiate those conversations. 
 
 
So I can that this opportunities helped to shape out policy work in this area and the shape of our future strategic lottery funds for arts and older people which will be launched in 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56c2fae1c89838.54276008</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Attended peer to peer session looking at developing arts and older people policy, convened by the Long Live Arts group at the City Hall, the Hague, The Netherlands.
