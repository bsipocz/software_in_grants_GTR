&lt;ol>
 

 &lt;li>to investigate the institutional economics of energy biomass and biofuel production from local to national and global scales&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>to undertake a technical assessment of resources and conversion routes&lt;/li>

&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>The energy garden concept originates from an idea developed by the Hassan Biofuels Park in India and will follow their approach for using local plant species as the source of biofuels, thereby avoiding loss of biodiversity as much as possible, and using marginal land to avoid competition with food crops.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project is a partnership of four organisations in Nepal and the Hassan Biofuels Park. The objectives will be achieved through a combination of policy analysis, reviews of plant species, analysis of technical options and field work in the villages. The aim is to test the feasibility of expanding the successful Energy Garden approach to Nepal and worldwide.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project aims to find a solution to the controversies surrounding use of biomass and biofuels for energy production by utilising indigenous plant species within the setting of small-scale poor farmers and communities in Nepal using 'Energy Gardens'. This will enhance energy access for poor farmers and communities in Nepal. 

Key beneficiaries are:

Poor farmers who will have enhanced energy access and potential for sale of bioenergy crops through use of indigenous species in their farming systems for biomass and biofuel production.

Communities where the poor farmers live through communal processing of bioenergy, using new technologies, derived from biomass grown in both individual farmers and community lands for community use.

The following beneficiaries have been identified:

South-South cooperation with the Hassan Biofuels Project in India that pioneered the energy garden approach and which has had a major influence on both State and National biofuel policies through its innovative solutions to sustainable biofuel energy access for poor farmers. Both the Hassan Biofuels Project and visitors from Nepal will benefit through exchange of information and knowledge which will be used to develop the energy garden concept and so benefit farmers and communities in Nepal. The exchange of information will take place during visits by the Nepali partner team to the Hassan Biofuels Project. The visit will take place during the early stages of the project.

In Nepal, project partners include the NGOs Asia Network for Sustainable Agriculture and Bioresources (ANSAB) and Practical Action, both of which are strongly engaged in practical implementation of poverty alleviation projects and can upscale the energy garden concept within Nepal, and in the case of Practical Action, internationally. Both NGOs will be immediate beneficiaries of the project results. Through their implementation projects the poor farmers and communities in Nepal will benefit; and through the international nature of Practical Action the energy garden concept could be upscaled to other countries.

An innovative communication pathway is through the partnership with Botanic Gardens International (BGCI). BGCI represents an international network of botanic gardens with over 700 members in 118 countries. The 700 members will be immediate beneficiaries of the project by direct information exchange. The project will produce a special edition of the Journal of Botanic Gardens Conservation International on 'Energy Gardens' using insights from the project presented in an accessible format and language. The BG journal is distributed to the BGCI membership and beyond. BGCI will also produce materials for distribution it is membership that can be used for setting up displays on bioenergy and the 'power of plants'. Botanic gardens represent an excellent way of disseminating information to the general public. The displays will combine all three aspects of sustainability: social, economic and environmental, which are associated with appropriate application of bioenergy. If the botanic gardens network use the display materials then the general public will benefit from the project results in a wide range of countries.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>78372</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>World Agroforestry Centre</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Kenya, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Strategies and Options for Nepal's Bioenergy Potential.

Strategies and Options for Nepal's Bioenergy Potential Phase I: Diagnostic Analysis and Demonstration Pilot Project

This Draft Concept Note is being prepared by the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF) and partners who contributed to the Multistakeholder Consultation on Scaling up Modern Bioenergy Production and Use through Sustainable Agroforestry Systems in Nepal, which took place on 16-17 November 2015 in Kathmandu. The views expressed here are those of the team, and reflect the outcomes of the Consultation. The event was organized by ICRAF, in collaboration with the Ethnobotanical Society of Nepal (ESON) and the University of Leeds. It attracted active participation from the Government of Nepal (National Planning Commission, Ministry of Energy, Ministry of Health &amp;amp; Population, AEPC, NAST), civil society (WWF, FEDO, NAF, Helvetas, Heifer International, ANSAB), academia (Kathmandu University, Tribhuvan University, Nepal Agriculture &amp;amp; Forestry University, University of Agricultural Sciences of Bangalore), private sector (Wind Power Nepal, FNCCI), international organizations (ICIMOD, IASS) and donor organization (Swiss Development Cooperation), among others.

The objectives of the project are fourfold:

1. To investigate the institutional economics of energy biomass and biofuel production from local to national and global scales. 
2. To undertake a technical assessment of resources and conversion routes. 
3. To combine the institutional and technical analyses to devise socio-economic incentives and structures for community cooperation and building long-enduring institutions around energy production and technology uptake. 
4. Dissemination and knowledge transfer. The nature of the project partnership ensures both north-south and south-south cooperation.

Project fieldwork took place in three Village Development Committees (VDC): Lakuri Danda (Dolakha), Khudi (Lamjung) and Hamsapur (Gorkha) in the mid-hills region of central and western Nepal. All three case study villages were connected to the electricity grid. Altogether 300 households were surveyed from three VDCs. A stratified random sampling method was used and the sampling framework was designed to capture local socio-economic and demographic variation. Samples were drawn on proportional basis from different income groups, castes, gender and household sizes to make sample representative for statistical analysis. Fifteen semi-structured key informant interviews were conducted, with five interviews from each of the three case study villages. Participants of the key informant interviews were drawn from different categories to reflect the socio-economic heterogeneity of the community and included local leaders, businessmen, community members and local development experts. Fifteen focus group discussions with five from each of the three VDCs were held at different locations within the selected VDCs. The participants of the focus group discussions also represented existing socio-economic heterogeneities in the villages, with participation from different landholding categories, castes, gender and local development experts to obtain views of different section of the community. The majority of the analysis is completed, contributing towards Objective 1, and this in turn will lead to completion of Objective 3. A comprehensive list of plant species with potential for biofuel/energy production has been compiled contributing towards Objective 2. We are in the process of obtaining biomass samples of plant species suitable for energy production in order to undertake a technical assessment of conversion routes to be carried out by a PhD student in the Bioenergy Doctoral Training Centre at Leeds, and a review of suitable technologies has been completed, contributing to Objective 2. The project has been active in fulfilling Objective 4 on dissemination through a series of meetings in Nepal; the creation of 'Energy Garden Ambassadors' in Nepal; establishing links with the Biofuel Park in Hassan, India; and international dissemination through Botanic Gardens Conservation International.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Community. Energy Garden Ambassadors: Senior students from Budhanilkantha School (Kathmandu), Kanjirowa National High School (Kathmandu) and Shree Shailaputri Higher Secondary School (Lamjung) have been nominated and trained as Energy Garden Ambassadors. Results of the fieldwork were presented at the Nepal Energy Garden Ambassadors' Workshop, inaugurated by Rt. Hon. Radha Kumari Gyawali, Minister for Energy, Government of Nepal on 10th October 2014 held in Kathmandu, Nepal. Altogether more than 170 dignitaries from more than 20 districts attended. 

Implementation. World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF): ICRAF has a global programme on biofuels aiming to improve livelihood and bioenergy provision for the rural communities and is implementing a four-year Programme for the Development of Alternative Biofuel Crops funded by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). ICRAF attended the October 2014 project workshop and expressed strong interest in implementing the project results. A meeting in Kathmandu planned for June 2015 has been postponed to November 2015 due to the series of earthquakes to hit Nepal in April and May.

Research. Bioenergy Centre for Doctoral Training (CTD): A PhD student at the Leeds Bioenergy CTD is conducting research on novel bioenergy technologies suitable for developing countries. In March 2016 a visitor from Nepal will be coming to Leeds for two weeks to collaborate in the analysis of material collected during the project field work in Nepal.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>319C6C11-4A7D-4A0F-8DB3-BFDC2D2EF1B3</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5463480ce87209.51780918</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Energy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/research/egc/projects/energygardensinnepal/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>CFB38B05-29A6-4970-9C6A-42D29EB4D1EC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Energy Gardens for Small-Scale Farmers in Nepal Institutions, Species and Technology.
