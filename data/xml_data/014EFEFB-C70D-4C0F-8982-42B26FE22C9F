To date, this early phase of South Asian diaspora has not been shaped into a phased monograph-length narrative, such as that proposed. The period is bracketed by the opening of the Suez Canal, and the relaxing of certain caste restrictions on Indians' travel at its one end, and by the outbreak of the First World War at its other, when, following the massive but controversial involvement of 1.5 million Indians in the War effort, Indian-British relations markedly changed in the direction of greater divisiveness and nationalist politicization. Building on and expanding the extensive, pathbreaking archival research carried out as part of the 2007-10 AHRC-funded 'Making Britain' project, not yet consolidated in monograph form, the book's narrative of the formation of Britain's first diasporic communities, and of the unfolding of the first India-British literary and cross-cultural collaborations, will be organized under five keynote headings capturing definitive aspects of the five decades in question, and rounding off with a coda and conclusion: Gateway Suez; London Under Indian Eyes; Oriental Fin de Siecle; Edwardian Extremists; 1912; Coda: The Indian Salient.The monograph will contend that the early 1870-1914 period was distinguished in particular by friendships and acts of hospitality operating in both directions between the cultures, on British soil, expressed as one-on-one exchanges between Indian and British individuals (Dadabhai Naoroji and his British hosts, Manmohan Ghose and Laurence Binyon, Sarojini Naidu and 1890s poets around Yeats, Margaret Noble and Ananda Coomaraswamy, Rothenstein and Tagore), and within groups such as the National Indian Association, the Theosophical Society, and the India Society which comprised both Indian and British members. It was also characterized by a frank and unabashed approach among the Indian travel writers, intellectuals, essayists and poets towards British culture and society, facilitated through new networks of trade and commerce, and religious and cultural interchange between India and Britain. From the British point of view, exchanges were animated also by a palpable, to date critically neglected British interest in India as providing new modes of knowledge, concepts of 'truth' and conventions of figuration at a time of intensive late Victorian and modernist self-questioning (so, for example, Ghose and Naidu found in the mannered, highly patterned poetics of decadence a way of insinuating their own distinctive, sinuous 'Oriental line', and William Rothenstein's explorations in Indian culture coincided with Roger Fry's First and Second Post-Impressionist Exhibitions, 1910, 1912). The study will ask whether the cosmopolitan vision of these writers and intellectuals anticipated the development of migrant South Asian and multicultural identities in Britain later in the twentieth century; and, finally, whether the fact that Indian troops held the Ypres salient on behalf of the Allies in 1914-15 can be cast as one of the most decisive and unequivocal ways in which Indians supported and interacted with Britain at this time. Gathering together the significant work in terms of new research and intensive academic and public outreach carried out by 'Making Britain' (including workshops, a massive data base, and a source book covering the entire 1870-1950 span), 'India Arrived, 1870-1914' will consolidate these findings into a structured narrative tracing the early coming-into-being of one of contemporary Britain's most prominent and influential migrant communities. Rather than surveying the wide field, the book will offer an informed and focused critical analysis of British-Indian interaction and its varied and distinctive literary-cultural impacts in a 45-year period.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The primary impact of the 'India Arrived, 1870-1914' project will be to produce a themed monograph on the first distinct and formative phase of South Asian migration to Britain, offering new insights to readers into how Britain has been a cultural and literary home to the sub-continent's migrants for well over a century. Drawing on an interlinked series of case studies of British-Indian collaborations and interactions, the book will engage a wide potential audience with critical reflections on how cross-cultural perceptions at this time operated as dialogic and conversational, not merely as 'othering'. The second impact will be to showcase and consolidate in narrative form the extensive archival research carried out by the current AHRC-funded Standard Research project 'Making Britain' (AH/E009859/1) (2007-10), especially on the period 1870-1914, into the contribution to British life by early South Asian migrant communities. Importantly, however, a third, related impact of 'India Arrived' will be to review, modify and extend the research questions of 'Making Britain', shifting the focus from exploring how Indians in general shaped Britain at the broad levels of social, political and activist inputs, to the more nuanced yet also influential and transformative ways in which Indians intellectuals, writers and other cultural practitioners, experienced, saw and 'read' Britain, and interacted with British culture in the long turn-of-the-century. By mapping a more elaborated network of cross-cultural Indian-British involvement through migration than has been available to date, 'India Arrived' will be of interest to a wide British public, those of diasporic descent, and those concerned with diaspora, migration, multi-cultural British heritage, and race equality in broad terms. It will appeal strongly to audiences enthusiastic about aspects of early migrant life in Britain and the migrant effect on British self-images and identity. The period in question demonstrates idiosyncratic forms of close sharing and hospitality fostered within tightly knit groups of intellectuals and writers, yet anticipates some of the creative exchanges that were to mark artistic partnerships in Britain's diasporic future, as Indian writers and cultural commentators contributed to contemporary ideas of arts and crafts, cultural decadence, cosmopolitanism and the modern. Oxford University Press, the projected publisher, has already indicated it will build on its previous productive collaborations on book promotions with the applicant, and help to draw in the book's broad potential readerships through an extensive programme of book readings, talks and discussions, as well as radio interviews and accompanying podcasts, to coincide with the launch of the volume. The applicant will also tap into her proven experience in disseminating research to a wider public, as with her co-organization of the BL 'Making Britain' exhibition (Sept. 2010-), organization of the 'Asian Bloomsbury' workshop at St John's College, Oxford (July 2008), and successful co-curatorship of the 'Indian Traces in Oxford' exhibition and public workshop at the Bodleian (March 2010). For those involved in debates about multicultural Britain today, the readings and public discussions sparked by the book will offer important insights into the centrality and fullness of Indian involvement in British cultural life from as far back as the late nineteenth century, and into how integral Indian cultural perspectives were to British self-perception and national understanding. It will powerfully dispel misconceptions, increasingly prominent in certain quarters, as regards the allegedly 'add on' or non-integrated aspects of the South Asian migrant presence in Britain. 'India Arrived' will add significantly to its audience's knowledge of the shifting ways in which groups and individuals within Britain h</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>35585</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Indian Traces in Oxford was an exhibition mounted in collaboration with the Bodleian Library, showcasing the remarkably wide range of textual and photographic traces or leavings of Indian students, activists, politicians, artists and others in the Bodleian special collections and College libraries, in the period 1870-1950. The exhibition opened with a half-day workshop, on 1 March 2010, in Convocation House, to be introduced by the acclaimed Indian novelist - and Oxford alumnus - Amitav Ghosh. 'Indian Traces at Oxford focuses in close detail on Indians' impact on Oxford University's life and culture. Both the exhibition and the 1 March workshop considered the value and meaning of manuscript traces, how they reflect on the ways in which Indians and Britons interacted in the period, and how we are able to imagine the lives of these early Indian travellers to Oxford into these textual tracks and marks.</gtr:description><gtr:id>D85503E9-9E30-4B79-9E25-5484EE112C79</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Indian Traces symposium which launched the exhibition had c. 60 attendees, and included a public tour of 'Indian Oxford' which attracted 25 participants (numbers had to be limited; it was later repeated in an ad hoc way several times). 7 'Bodcasts' of the symposium were recorded as part of the Oxford Spires podcasting project (one by Boehmer; others by A Ghosh, H Ansari, R Arrowsmith, R Sorabji, A.

The Oxford English Faculty contributed &amp;pound;4000 of funding assistance. This travelling exhibition, widely advertised in local newspapers and relevant venues (e.g. Woking mosque), provided a more mobile vehicle for informing public understanding of British immigration in and beyond the UK. It traced through photographs and text the impact of early Indian migration to Britain, 1870-1950, including South Asian contributions to sport, the arts, domestic, cultural and intellectual life, resistance and activism, as well as national and global politics - interpreting a wealth of new material from archives in India, Sri Lanka, the United States and Britain. Boehmer helped to select the images and authored three of the 12 panel texts, looking at Literature and Arts, Intellectual Life, and World War I. In July 2010 four preview panels featured as the backdrop to an introductory reception in New Delhi for the British coalition government's trade mission to India, where they provided background for the Prime Minister's meeting with leaders of the arts and culture sector at the British Council. The panels (made available in response to a special request from the then head of BBC India) made the visual point that Britain recognises the positive cultural contribution of Indian migration over the past century and a half and is seeking to build on the resulting close connections between the two countries in its current and future trading arrangements. They also demonstrated a long history of close cultural and economic involvement between the two countries, so that consolidating trade relations today can be seen to embed an already existing relationship. Between September 2010 and July 2011 the full 12 panels began a touring exhibition, funded jointly by British Library Regional Programmes and Open University Strategic Funding. They were displayed initially at the British Library, 13-14 Sept. 2010, then for periods of 3-6 weeks at: Bradford Central Library; Manningham Library, Shipley; St. Barnabas Library, Leicester; Birmingham Central Library; Jubilee Library, Brighton; Surrey History Centre, Woking (footfall 1,727); Croydon Central Library; Barking Library; Swiss Cottage Library; Middlesborough Library; and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. With the aid of funding from the British Council in Berlin, an expanded version of the exhibition moved in early 2012 to the Centre for British Studies, Alexander von Humboldt University, Berlin, 31 Jan.-16 March; returning to the UK for final showings at Asia House and Southall Library. In Berlin the exhibition's work in informing and changing preconceptions about the cultural impact of immigration contributed directly to the delivery of school curricula.</gtr:description><gtr:id>C50E9DF4-E74A-455A-84A8-1CFABB0CD8F1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Feedback from the many visitors who commented appreciatively includes (from a teacher) 'Thank you very much for a very interesting exhibition on our 2nd semester's topic - &amp;quot;Cultural Identity/Migration&amp;quot;.

The research gives the wider public as well as present and future scholars of migration insight into the deep history of Britain's diasporas on British soil-indeed of these diasporas as fundamental to the on-going making of British identity, and so as part of an unfolding story of layering and mixing which has defined lives and selves on these islands from the time that 'Britain began' (Cunliffe). The portraits that the research presents of culturally translated individuals, unlikely friendships, and encounters between strangers melting rapidly into familiarity (including Gandhi, Naidu, Binyon, Rothenstein, Tagore) appeal strongly to audiences enthusiastic about aspects of early migrant life in imperial Britain, especially concerning the migrant effect on British self-perception-as the feedback on my exhibition involvements attests (OxAsians 2010; Indian Traces in Oxford 2010). Viewers expressed significant excitement at finding the external, outside-in views of migrants embedded in what are generally thought of as quintessentially British environments, as in the discovery that Indian travellers 'read' metropolitan London through an urban visual vocabulary drawn from Bombay or Calcutta, or that the Oriental undertones of nineteenth-century decadence were supplied by Anglicized poets such as Sarojini Naidu or Manmohan Ghose in their attempt to 'easternize' their work (viz. again the Bodleian exhibition 'Indian Traces in Oxford'). The articles, essays, and now monograph generated from the research have offered new insights into how Britain has been a home to sub-continental migrants for well over a century. 

As for impacts on public policy, on 24 January 2012 I was an invited participant in a Scoping Workshop under the auspices of the UK Government Office for Science, aimed at framing initial terms for a fuller 'Foresight' report on 'Future Identities'. Both the workshop and the project itself were arranged by Sir John Beddington (Chief Scientific Advisor). The workshop was a civil service day forum on the social, political, cultural and environmental impacts of migration on British society now and into the future. I used my research to report on migration as a public good, against the current public trend to see immigration as a social problem.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>20B09B07-827F-4617-984B-3C76C6CEC9BC</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5460cdb888b832.16171573</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>India Arrived: Seeing and Being in Britain, 1870-1914 succeeded in expanding the knowledge of and insight into South Asian diasporic history in Britain by extending the narrative of migration significantly back in time, eight decades before the relatively well-known post-1950 period. Across its different outputs, in particular the monograph, the study was distinguished for its unprecedentedly detailed and far-reaching exploration of the India-Britain relationship from the perspective of Indian writers, intellectuals, maharajahs, politicians and gurus in Britain, rather than the more conventional metropolitan angle. It also considered how modern urban Britain was viewed by these self-conscious citizens of the empire. By focusing on Indian perspectives and inputs to cross-cultural interaction in the period the research examined in depth the contribution that these Indian writers and intellectuals on British soil made to some of the leading literary-cultural movements and cosmopolitan identities of the day (the metropolitan travelogue, orientalist writing, decadence, detective fiction, Georgian poetry, early geometric modernism), none of which was till very recently seen as moulded by Indian hands.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings have already been taken forward and used in the OxAsians exhibition, which toured from 2010, and explored the biographical trajectories of prominent Indians at Oxford in the 20th century.
In so far as the 'India Arrived' research gave the wider public as well as present and future scholars of migration insight into the deep history of Britain's diasporas on British soil-indeed of these diasporas as fundamental to the on-going making of British identity, and so as part of an unfolding story of layering and mixing which has defined lives and selves on these islands from the time that 'Britain began' (Cunliffe) -- it is sure to feed forwards into migration projects and exhibitions in the future. In this centenary year for the outbreak of the First World War there has already been notable media attention (eg BBC World Service) to the involvement of Indian soldiers on the western front -- a subject with which my final chapter deals at length.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>74A9AD2B-085F-4A68-A0E4-E874C744F0DD</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>5460cbf7e47993.40275025</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Invited participation in 'Foresight' report on 'Future Identities' under the auspices of the UK Government Office for Science</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>67A3E0D8-A769-4D08-A41E-A06BC715EBB5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The workshop was a civil service day forum on the social, political, cultural and environmental impacts of migration on British society now and into the future. Boehmer reported on migration as a public good, drawing on material from her essay subsequently published in Only Connect to demonstrate that the UK has been a society of migrants for a long time (at least from the mid-19th C) and has been generally more receptive than not: in short, migration is nothing new, and represents no cause for a moral panic in the present day. Indeed, Britain has largely benefited from migration (it's impossible to think of this society as a purely native-born society). Her emphasis is discernible in the final Scoping Workshop report, especially it's underscoring of the complexity of identity, the importance of histories of migration and of integration into Britain for migrants (pp. 2, 9, 20, 45-50, 53) (Ref. i). Boehmer attended the follow on meeting of the Foresight (government) forum, and launch for the report. Eleri Jones, project leader, confirms that the report (published in 2013) 'took a broad view of the current evidence for the drivers of change affecting identity in the UK over the next decade, bringing together for the first time current evidence and pointing out some of the main implications for policy makers. The report has proved useful for a range of Government Departments and there has been interest from, for example, parts of the Cabinet Office.'
