Magnetic phenomena are technologically highly relevant, and have applications, ranging from magnetic storage in computers, over strong permanent magnets, as used in wind driven generators, to magnetic cooling devices, which could replace current refrigerators by more energy efficient ones, or magnetic sensors.

A full understanding of these complex phenomena, which could lead to the development of novel materials, requires a simultaneous understanding of different aspects of magnetism, starting from the microscopic, quantum mechanic phenomena, giving rise to magnetism in the first place, to geometrical effects of electromagnetism, which are relevant at larger length scales. The UK already has very strong groups, working on different facets of magnetism and using different techniques to study magnetic phenomena.

The main emphasis of this CCP-mag network is on a multi-scale description of magnetic materials, and on methods and codes used by experimentalists to analyse and interpret their measurements. The aim is to combine the present expertise, and bring the groups together to tackle the complex phenomena simultaneously on different length scales. To this end, we will interface the existing codes, such that they can exchange data in an easy way, to provide new ways of calculations, which previously would be very difficult to perform.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The new CCP on Computational Magnetism will have long lasting impact on groups beyond the immediate academic community. Magnetic phenomena and materials are crucial to a wide range of technologies and accelerated development of these technologies will have a far reaching impact on society through improved energy efficient power generation and transportation, magnetic data storage and improved medical diagnostics and cancer treatments. 

Whilst modelling plays an increasingly important role in the manufacturing process, it is so far at the macroscopic scale that its impact is most clearly felt. Joining the different scales from atomistic, over mesoscale to device size remains as yet a distant objective. Creating state of the art computational tools to understand materials at all levels (from the microscopic, quantum-mechanical description up to large scale effects) will therefore result in a new paradigm for materials science. The novel CCP will bring together communities with expertise in all areas of magnetism, and pooling these capabilities will lead to the development of a truly multi-scale software solution that can be applied in a bottom up approach to developing and designing functional magnetic materials. 

Being able to accurately simulate magnetic materials will lead to savings in the manufacturing process of devices, as it can dramatically speed up the design process, eliminating many trial and error experiments. The activities of the CCP-mag consortium will directly engage with industrial researchers developing new magnetic devices and materials, promoting the use of new state of the art methods and software to accelerate the development of next generation products with improved performance and energy efficiency. Networking events and conference attendance will target greater industrial engagement of academic research and collaboration with the developers of simulation software, providing a direct route for knowledge transfer. Wider collaboration with industry will feed directly into the development of new software features and capabilities of direct relevance to future technologies. CCP-mag training activities will directly contribute to wider knowledge of state of the art magnetic simulation methods among graduate students and researchers in the UK. Some of these researchers will move to industry bringing specialist knowledge of magnetic simulation tools and methods enabling accelerated development of new products and magnetic devices.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>203009</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Magnetism workshop(Chester)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8EDF483E-5EF1-4C2D-A072-FBB5D4368018</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Adaptive magnetic materials, such as magnetic shape memory alloys or magneto-caloric intermetallics are characterized by the changes in structural and magnetic properties when subjected to an external influence.

The goal of this workshop was focussed on the understanding of magnetic materials beyond the ground state, and their response to external stimuli. In particular, the aim was to build solutions that will bridge the current gap in our fundamental understanding of the magnetic states of rare earth materials when compared with what is available for d-electron based materials. The workshop aimed to merge and enhance insights from the different computational approaches currently under development for the study of magnetic order and magnetic excitations. The predictions of the simulations and possible further improvements of the existing computational methodologies to f-electron systems were debated by the computational materials modellers and experts in both experimental and applied magnetism.</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>56cde550a38693.01262236</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://eventbooking.stfc.ac.uk/news-events/ab-initio-modelling-workshop</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>2016 IoP Magnetism Winter School(computational workshop)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A71DC883-A8D7-42DF-AB57-CA9A0E05B3D1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Introduction to VAMPIRE; open source software simulation package for atomistic simulation of magnetic materials.
