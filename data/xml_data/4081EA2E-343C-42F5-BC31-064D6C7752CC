This random archive materializes the Greek colonial class which effectively governed Egypt from Alexander the Great to the Arab conquest. About 10% of the papyri come from books, among them classical Greek authors whose work disappeared in whole or part during the Middle Ages: the songs of Sappho, the comedies of Menander, the elegies of Callimachus, all famous in their time. The remainder comprises public and private documents: edicts, tax-assessments, tax-returns, census-forms, property-registers, sales, leases, loans, receipts, wills, marriages, shopping-lists, household accounts and many private letters, spanning mostly the first seven centuries AD, when Egypt was a province of the Roman and Byzantine Empires. 
 The sorting, decipherment and publication of this material continues, and the results constitute a unique resource for scholars in various disciplines. Historians of classical literature get access to vanished libraries, which have recently yielded (for example) poems by Archilochus and Simonides; they can also study reading-habits and local litterateurs, the history of the book and the development of education. For the Roman historian, the documents come much closer to the ground than the literary sources, which focus on high politics. Official diaries record the day-to-day activity of officials. Court records show the cohabitation of Roman and local law. Land-leases and donkey-sales hint at levels of inflation. Private letters illustrate the grass-roots economy, the networks of family and friends, the Greek language assuming its modern form. Both books and documents chronicle Egyptian Christianity: persecution and establishment, uncanonical gospels and doctrinal strife, personal devotion in prayers and amulets.
 In this new phase of the project we propose to publish 300 unedited papyri, chosen for their special contribution to the cultural and political history of the Roman and early Byzantine world. We will publish early papyri of an uncanonical Gospel, of the Greek Old Testament and of patristic texts, which exemplify the reading habits and doctrinal evolution of the primitive church: among them, fragments in Greek and in Coptic of the widely popular 'Shepherd of Hermas'. We have identified literary texts of works and authors long lost, to include fragments of Simonides and of unknown comedies, novels and historians, like 'Kalligone and the Amazons' and an anonymous 'Alexander and his successors'; and also of known authors (Thucydides, Apollonius Rhodius) whose text can be improved by the very early copies in our collection. A group of school exercises and grammars will document the intellectual formation of the provincial elite, from elementary schooling to oratorical mastery. Documentary texts have been chosen to illuminate the relations between Egypt, its grandees and its population, and the Emperor and his regime. So, a Prefect of Egypt stands accused of corruption before the Emperor Hadrian; a shield-shaped placard was once carried in procession to celebrate an imperial anniversary; further papers from the archives of the Apion family highlight the local barons whom Byzantine Emperors had to coopt and control. Add the drawings, now assembled for the first time, which range from simple doodles to illustrated books, from architectural blueprints to textile-designs: an Infant Horus in the Primal Egg illustrates Greco-Egyptian religion, an Angel with Black Boots reflects Christian iconography.
 Empire and Late Antiquity, in all their complex reality, have left a paper-trail in the dumps of Oxyrhynchus, and this is the trail that our project will be following.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Greece and Rome are not dead: new information accrues all the time (excavations, inscriptions, papyri). Our Project will diffuse virgin material, a chosen group of new papyri. The first beneficiaries will be specialists, but we seek also to spread our enthusiasm to a more general constituency. The success of Peter Parsons' book on Oxyrhynchus, 'City of the Sharp-nosed Fish' (now translated into six European languages), suggests a wide audience in waiting.
 The Oxyrhynchus project has always been a British enterprise, but it recruits expert contributors Europewide and beyond, offering a platform for inter-cultural communication that goes beyond academic collaboration. Its publications impact on a whole range of Mediterranean studies.
 The papyri will be published in five annual volumes: at each stage we shall enter the basic texts and translations into the Duke DataBank of Documentary Papyri and the nascent Digital Corpus of Literary Papyri (Heidelberg/New York), which ensure immediate electronic circulation. The Project's substantial web-presence will be maintained also through collaboration with the Imaging Papyri Project, which will host digital images of the papyri as they reach publication (http://www.papyrology.ox.ac.uk/POxy). 
 Our papyri provide the backbone for the training of students in papyrology, but their appeal extends beyond tertiary education: they offer a unique worm's-eye view of Greco-Roman culture in its local setting. Schools and Continuing Education programmes engage with the material: we shall continue to respond by giving talks (with original papyri) and hosting visits to the collection. Thus pupils studying Classical Civilisation will encounter at first hand documents written in the ancient languages, which may encourage them to learn the languages themselves. 
 We shall continue to make available material for the citizen science enterprise 'Ancient Lives'. This puts images online and encourages anyone interested to try their hand at decipherment and to submit the results electronically to the organisers. The site claims more than 925, 000 users, and some results (checked and written up by professionals) will fuel our publications.
 We shall reach a wider public by promoting events and exhibitions that highlight the new material included in this application. We plan lectures and panels for a general audience, on the lines of 'Pulp Fiction' (British Academy, Feb. 2015). The exhibition 'One God' (British Museum, Nov. 2015) will showcase one of our new drawings, as well as six published items; we are negotiating to lend further unpublished drawings to an exhibition at the Uffizi Gallery (in planning); we shall ourselves mount an exhibition of biblical and patristic texts for the Patristic Congress of 2017 (Oxford). 
 Individual papyri often allow appealing glimpses of real life: thus P.Oxy. 5209, in which a boy wrestler contracts to throw his match for a fee, made headlines on the BBC World Service and as far away as Der Spiegel and Fox News. We include in this application a selection of comparable papyri, each of which forms the centrepiece of a wider story about ancient society: Christian origins, women's life and literacy, magic and anxiety, Egypt and its arts. In tandem with research and publication we shall systematically promote public interest in these finds through press releases via the press offices of our Universities and of the Egypt Exploration Society and the British Academy, and in regular briefings for the AHRC's own website and channel. 
 The rubbish of Oxyrhynchus has its own strange glamour, still felt when a public event (actors and papyrologists) celebrated the 25th anniversary of Tony Harrison's Trackers of Oxyrhynchus (Nov. 2013). Most recently, Jenny Saville's exhibition 'Oxyrhynchus' (2014) shows artwork inspired by the vision of piled up paper. We shall seize any chance to build on this appeal.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>797134</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seminar 'Accustomed as I am to public speaking'</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1DFD5A42-A776-4775-8699-996DE4ACB321</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Egypt Exploration Society in London runs a series of Saturday seminars for its members, who are largely members of the public with a strong amateur interest in Ancient Egypt.

(2) '13 exhibitions in 9 rooms', Staatliche Kunsthalle Baden-Baden, 25 November 2016: exhibition by the artist Michael M&amp;uuml;ller, whose introductory performance (on concepts of love) featured Oxyrhynchus Papyrus no. 2102, a copy of Plato's Phaedrus, with bilingual captions by our RA Daniela Colomo
(3) 'The Popes and the Unity of the Latin World', Reiss-Engelhorn-Museen, Museum Zeughaus, Mannheim, 2 May - 17 November 2017. We are preparing Oxyrhynchus papyrus no. 2067, the earliest known copy of the Nicene Creed, to be displayed in this exhibition.

We note also the revival of Tony Harrison's 'Trackers of Oxyrhynchus', a play based on the excavations from which our Project began, at the Finborough Theatre, London, 3-28 January 2017 (all performances sold out).
The group of magical texts published in vol. 82 continue to feature in the Mail Online, with emphasis on the spells designed to 'possess the heart' of a woman and on the medical recipes that use bird-droppings ('Vulture droppings with honey cool a fever' etc).
The knock-about farce published in vol. 79 no. 5189, a remarkable sample of the popular drama that appealed to a Byzantine audience, has been made into an animated film, 'Trashy Humour: A Comedy in Pieces' (5 1/2 minutes), which will eventually be available on line.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>EBF0D558-F6CD-4E50-A80A-43B9E2184766</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>58a2fd89d38e37.16060776</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The two volumes published in this period (papyri nos. 5258-5343) contribute important data in three central areas of the Project's research. 

 1. Religious texts: early Christianity. Papyri datable to the third and fourth centuries AD attest what early Christians were reading before the New Testament canon solidified. Ephesians (5258) is not surprising, but I Timothy (5259) is a rarity, and 5290 offers the Book of Jannes and Jambres (two magicians who opposed Moses, II Timothy 3.8), an apocryphal work known only from fragments but widely enough read to be translated into Ethiopic. Magic remained important, transcending the boundary between pagan and Christian, and this is illustrated in a dozen new texts. The most basic resource was the amulet. Three written by the same magician offer Christian protection against seven types of fever (5306-7); another catalogues the angels and their spheres of interest, who are to favour Johannes the wearer of the amulet (5312); a hymn in praise of the Cross (5260) may serve a similar purpose. The magician, whether professional or amateur, needed handbooks of spells, and we have fragments of these in 5303-5, which include spells to subdue the heart of a woman and to silence your opponent in a lawcourt. This is the syncretistic world of Late Antiquity, in concrete detail: note 5309, an amulet for a Christian with the pagan name of Apis which offers protection 'now now quickly quickly' - the typical formula of pagan erotic charms. Christian imagery appears in 5343, a sketch in black and red ink of Daniel with two fawning lions.

 2. Ancient Greek Literature. The Egyptian Greeks read classical texts which then disappeared in the Middle Ages. 5261, from the lost poet Simonides, corrects a passage which survives otherwise only in quotation. 5292 offers a fragment from the lost Tereus of Sophocles, ending the rueful reflections of the heroine and leading into a messenger speech by a shepherd; 5283-5 preserve prose summaries of the plays of Euripides, with substantial new information about the lost tragedies Danae and Dictys. A later genre, the novel, benefits from 5262-3: the lost Romance of Sesonchosis King of Egypt was one of those 'historical' novels in which the Greeks of the diaspora could enjoy the reflected glory of the ancient conquerors who had ruled their new homeland. 5263, perhaps a summary rather than the novel itself, shows for the first time the full ambition of this saga: Sesonchosis moves northwards from Egypt through Italy and Germany to Britain, then to Thule and the ice, then back and westwards to the place where the sun sets, where he meets the phoenix. Alongside these we have early witnesses to known texts. The papyri often show the textual tradition at a stage earlier than the medieval manuscripts: so 5266 may correct a reading in Sophocles Philoctetes, 5296 contributes five new readings, one at least very plausible, in Theocritus Idyll 22. At the same time they show what texts were being read at Oxyrhynchus in which centuries. Polybius the historian is a rarity (5267, 5300), even rarer an Euclid with diagrams (5299); really notable a fresh crop of identifications (some made through the crowd-sourcing site 'Ancient Lives') that represent 'contemporary' authors being read in their own generation or the next - Plutarch, Epictetus, Lucian, Oppian (5270-78, 5301). Thus modern best-sellers, as well as ancient classics, made their way to a market town in Egypt: a solid reminder of the global range and force of Hellenic culture in the Roman Empire.

 3. Roman and Byzantine Egypt: economy and society. Individual documents reinforce the texture of life in a highly bureaucratic system. Economic management depends partly on a census every fourteen years (5318), and legal challenges go up the hierarchy from strategos to epistrategos to the Prefect himself (5316, 5319); on the ground everything depends on the harvest, and therefore on a fully engineered and maintained irrigation system (5320). In the fifth and sixth centuries the economic base remains the same, societal forms change (3522-42): these documents, which include some from the huge family archive of the patrician Apiones, illustrate the enterprises of large landowners and the administration of great ('feudal') estates. The government continues to tax: so in 5339-41 individuals who have disposed of property take care to report the fact to the tax-inspectors, with a request to remove their liability from the records. But the estate is a world in itself. 5289, a petition of the seventh century, may serve as a snapshot of the early medieval scene. Marous, who claims to have been beaten up by another woman, appeals not to a public official but to her estate manager, describing herself as 'your slave' and begging him to protect her rights, since the accused is 'giving presents to the authorities and spreading rumours' about her.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>These volumes provide unique new data for theologians, classical scholars and ancient historians, and contribute material for synthetic studies of early Christianity, Greek literature and literary culture, and the economic and social structures of the Roman empire and its Byzantine successors.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>CF243DE0-11F0-4226-8E17-A5006AD73160</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>58a8877db767a8.25565132</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>67EB8AF2-CC23-4567-80B4-524DC809ABA3</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Oxyrhynchus Papyri vol. 81</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/3de1c0947093b36e897bce042d71714d"><gtr:id>3de1c0947093b36e897bce042d71714d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Brusuelas J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978 0 85698 229 3</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>587b968d770ab2.27240823</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>84A4E7C9-9A4C-42A4-9C80-794EF1527A28</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Oxyrhynchus Papyri vol. 82</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/fd2fffbb50776babb9af378af0ae0456"><gtr:id>fd2fffbb50776babb9af378af0ae0456</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gonis N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-0-85698-230-9</gtr:isbn><gtr:outcomeId>5899cd72a86448.84663510</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/M011313/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>66751786-9917-41F1-A8BB-CE06F47C2453</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Classics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>FED118D3-C8D1-42BF-829F-C2CD1390FF49</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Classical Literature</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>89068F3B-44C7-45D9-92CB-8BE148301439</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Classical Reception</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>C97D3463-9A59-45DF-A24C-739A3B93B405</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Epigraphy &amp; Papyrology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
