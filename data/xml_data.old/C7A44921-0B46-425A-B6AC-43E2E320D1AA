For example, participants might falsely believe they saw the word&amp;nbsp;&lt;em>sleep&lt;/em>&amp;nbsp;after studying related words such as&amp;nbsp;&lt;em>bed&lt;/em>,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em>dream&lt;/em>,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em>wake&lt;/em>,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em>snore&lt;/em>&amp;nbsp;etc.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The aim of the proposed research is to explore the possibility that false memories serve a useful function by guiding future behaviour. Participants will be presented with lists of words and asked to rate them in a number of ways, including their relevance to a past event, relevance to a planned future event, or how pleasant they are (control condition). The lists will be structured in such a way as to produce high levels of false memories (based on previous research). The hypothesis is that thinking about a planned future event activates related information that might be useful in terms of planning the activity. If this is the case then rating words for their relevance to a planned future event will increase the numbers of false memories for related words.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Beneficiaries of the proposed research may include any professional concerned with the accuracy of human memory and the factors that influence susceptibility to false memories. The findings of the proposed research are likely to have significant implications for theories of human memory, particularly in terms of the everyday functions of memory. Understanding factors that increase (or reduce) susceptibility to false memories is also a necessary first step in determining the reliability of memory reports in applied or forensic settings. Although the research will be conducted under laboratory conditions, the practical, educational, and forensic implications of this type of false memory research have been widely discussed (see, for example, Brainerd et al., 2011). The findings of the proposed research will inform ongoing debates about the relevance of laboratory studies of false memories to applied settings. 

Although the proposed research will focus on false memories in healthy individuals, the findings may have clinical relevance, as the ability to imagine future events is impaired in people with depression. Depression has also been found to reduce false memories for positive and neutral words, but to increase false memories for negative and depression-related words. Although there are no plans to investigate false memories in people with depression during the period of the award, the findings will provide a foundation for future research investigating the possibility that the proposed adaptive functions of false memories are compromised in people with depression. 

The proposed research will enhance the knowledge economy via new knowledge and theoretical advancement. The project will also deliver a highly skilled researcher by ensuring that the appointed research associate receives appropriate training in terms of experimental design, data collection and analysis, dissemination via written reports and conference presentations, and the preparation of grant applications. Career development opportunities will also be made available to the research associate via the Researcher Development Framework at the University of Hull.

Recently, however, research has begun to show that false memories, or at least the processes that cause them, can have beneficial consequences. The aim of the current proposal was to investigate whether the processes that give rise to false memories can help one to plan future events. We conducted a series of experiments in which participants were asked to imagine a future event, remember a past event, or think about a typical event (with no instructions to refer to the past or the future). In some experiments, the events were familiar ones (e.g., going on holiday) and in others the events were unfamiliar (e.g., taking part in a bank robbery). Participants were then presented with lists of object nouns and asked to rate the likelihood that each object was (or would be) present at the event. Participants were then given an unexpected memory test for the words they rated. A critical feature of each experiment was that some of the more obvious items (i.e. items that one would typically expect to see at the event) were not presented in the rating task. What we were interested in was whether the rating task would affect the number of studied words remembered and the number of typical but unstudied words falsely remembered. Our findings were clear and consistent. In each experiment, the rating task had no effect on the number of words correctly remembered, but participants in the future conditions produced significantly more false memories than those in the past and atemporal conditions. This suggests that thinking about future events activates related information that might guide the planning of the events. This hypothesis was supported by an additional experiment in which we replaced the memory test with a listing task. Participants rated words for their relevance to a past, future, or typical holiday, and were then asked to list as many items as they could think of that one might take on holiday. Compared to the past and atemporal conditions, participants in the future condition listed more items that were not presented in the rating task. This suggests that future thinking activates a &amp;quot;planning mode&amp;quot; that enables participants to think beyond the information presented to them and directs their attention to other items that one might need in that scenario. Other experiments revealed the boundary conditions of the effect of future thinking. For example, no significant effects of rating task were observed in tests of implicit memory (e.g., when participants were instructed to complete word stems with the first words that came to mind) or when the object nouns were replaced by action phrases. The research has so far led to one publication in a prestigious cognitive psychology journal, a second paper that is almost ready for submission, conference presentations at which the research was presented to other memory researchers, and the career development of an outstanding early-career researcher who was employed to work on the proposal.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>One possible direction for future research would be to investigate whether the facilitation of future planning is impaired in people with depression. Previous research has shown that people with depression find it difficult to imagine positive future events. Our research has identified some of the processes that underpin the generation of future events (e.g., the spontaneous activation of information that is related to the information presented). It may be possible to develop strategies that increase the activation of such information, especially in relation to positive future events. If so, interventions directed at the generation of associations might enhance the ability to imagine such events in people with depression.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>15EF51FC-7143-460A-8BE2-4B91FAFBFA1A</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>54522385e568f5.12113866</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Data have been deposited with UK Data Service.</gtr:description><gtr:id>92332598-7533-4BE9-A65E-8A67B78969E5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None</gtr:impact><gtr:outcomeId>58946088235850.98270911</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Database</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://reshare.ukdataservice.ac.uk/852532/</gtr:url></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>48496E76-53A4-4DD8-BAB1-11D57FBC0053</gtr:id><gtr:title>Imagining future scenarios increases false memory.</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/82f604de951ade498afe0910fbdb412c"><gtr:id>82f604de951ade498afe0910fbdb412c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dewhurst, S.A.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>562b7c0fc982c4.23288193</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication><gtr:publication><gtr:id>5C042608-FD6D-4697-BF7E-3E65883D93EC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Adaptive false memory: Imagining future scenarios increases false memories in the DRM paradigm.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Memory &amp; cognition</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/163fdfa15c85104dc6be0dd25d71b14a"><gtr:id>163fdfa15c85104dc6be0dd25d71b14a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dewhurst SA</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0090-502X</gtr:issn><gtr:outcomeId>5767b857e85b01.39842579</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/K010565/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E457FFDE-A4C1-4907-AE12-A394D95A3AE5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cognitive Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E1AC33C6-9927-41AC-B23B-2EED8F593588</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Experimental Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
