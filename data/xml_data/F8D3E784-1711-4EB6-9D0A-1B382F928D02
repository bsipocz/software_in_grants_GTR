In the V model, the first arm (descending) represents the requirements specification and validation, and the second arm (ascending) represents implementation verification. This process has been adopted by many industries where safety is critical (aerospace, defence, rail, nuclear, etc.). Today, modelling and simulation are often used in industry to aid system design and support the validation of requirements.

The difficulty is, early in the development process, system requirements may be uncertain and the system design is immature. Therefore, assumptions are made about both requirements and design without quantifying the uncertainty or considering the impact the uncertainty may have. As a result, additional requirements and design loops, as well as late changes, are often needed to fix errors that are found late in development. The consequence of this is that longer development times and higher costs are incurred. 

What is urgently needed is a way to consider and understand uncertainty in a methodical and quantifiable way. This research will provide a new framework and methods that prescribe how engineers can quantify and control uncertainty in the development of aircraft systems. The framework will allow engineers to make more informed decisions by identifying key parameters and their priority (in terms of their ability to impact the system design). It will allow engineers to reduce uncertainty in equipment requirements, especially for long lead time or high cost items. It will also allow engineers to focus equipment suppliers, and their modelling and simulation activities, on areas where uncertainty could most impact system performance. This would ultimately result in a shorter development cycle due to fewer changes and design loops, reduced likelihood of errors and ultimately reduced costs. Therefore, developing a framework that considers uncertainty in the development process would increase the competitiveness of UK companies within the aerospace, defence, rail and nuclear industries.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The short-term beneficiaries of this research will be Airbus and Safran Landing Systems. Airbus and Safran will benefit because the case studies used to test the framework are based on systems which they typically develop. In return for their in-kind support (access to engineering expertise, models, etc), they will benefit from the results and gain access to the expertise developed at the University of Bristol.

The medium to long term beneficiaries of this research are the companies who use the aircraft system development process. This includes aircraft manufacturers and the wider supply chain involved in aircraft systems such as Tier 1 system integrators like Rolls Royce, GE and Thales, as well as equipment suppliers such as Ultra Electronics, Cobham and Meggitt.

If this framework becomes an embedded part of the industries' system development process, it has the potential to significantly reduce development times and ultimately costs. Therefore, UK aerospace companies will increase their competitiveness. In the future, defence, rail, nuclear and other industries where safety is critical, will also benefit by using the framework to improve the development process for their systems.
 
Within the period of the grant, societal benefits will come through the PI's participation in an Aerospace Outreach Day for year 8 girls at local schools. This will promote aerospace engineering as an exciting and achievable career for the next generation of female engineers and researchers. The PI will gain experience of talking about their work in a non-academic setting.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2019-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100509</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/R019134/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
