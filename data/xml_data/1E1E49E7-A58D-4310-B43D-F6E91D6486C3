Impact statement

Outreach: enthusing the next generation of scientists
The LHC story and the discovery of the Higgs boson has captured the public's imagination. This has raised the awareness of science and contributed to the increasing number of students studying Physics. ATLAS-UK has been at the forefront of the outreach activities to publicise and explain the physics of the LHC and the impact that it has, through talking to schools and the general public in the UK and by supporting school visits to CERN. 
Training
The training of students and young researchers in particle physics provides a workforce that is skilled in a range of disciplines critical to the UK economy: software, engineering (covering electronics, mechanical and software), project management, data analysis. They also learn important &amp;quot;soft skills&amp;quot;: working in a large complex organization both as a member of a team and independently, and living and working in an international environment.
Working with industry
ATLAS-UK is seeking to promote UK industry wherever this is appropriate with the aim of placing of companies in a position to provide elements for the upgrade. In addition to the knowledge exchange between ATLAS-UK and the companies in the development of components it also provides these companies with an international showcase. 
Examples include:
? Micron semiconductor, the UK is working with Micron to develop pixel sensors for the pixel tracker upgrade. Several iterations have been designed and characterised. Developments have included studying &amp;quot;slim edges&amp;quot; and developing an in-house under-bump-metalisation for bump bonding. 
? Zot, development of flexible hybrids to the high specifications required for the pixel tracker system of the tracker upgrade. This includes high reliability and being able to handle high bandwidth signals. 
? Stevenage, fabrication of hybrids and hybrid test panels for strip tracker system. Stevenage and ATLAS-UK have worked together to creatively use Stevenage's capability to produce a hybrid design that robustly fits within their production capabilities whilst being a non-standard item. This design is also being investigated with ZOT as an alternative vendor, they use different materials and their finished produce is of lower cost and is almost same quality.
? Intel, collaborating on the processor aspects of the upgrade ATLAS-UK- have been working closely with Intel on the processor aspects of the upgrade, helping them shape their own future planning. 
? Commercial cloud providers (e.g. DataCentred), collaborating with them to understand if they can handle our use cases, as we are often predictors of the future market needs. 

Other applications
The UK's silicon detector experience has been used to develop beam characterization systems for hadron therapy (Pravda project). In our tracking software, algorithms similar to those used in medical applications as used. As we develop these, there is a clear possibility of health/societal impact, and there are already several proposed projects in the Data Science CDT bids that would advance that impact.

An example from the current Phase-I construction project
For the current Phase-I construction project, ATLAS-UK has worked closely with Invotec to build the PCBs for the calorimeter trigger (eFEX). This has clearly been a learning process for Invotec. The eFEX is the most ambitious board they have made, due to the combination of: the PCB material, the number and density of the tracks, and the use of multiple levels of blind and buried vias, requiring multiple build stages. Invotec and ATLAS-UK have worked closely together to solve issues found during a couple of failed manufacturing iterations before a working board was produced. Two PCBs have now been tested with very good results, demonstrating that Invotec have acquired the capability to produce a board at the cutting edge of what can be achieved. The value of the bare boards is &amp;pound;120k and when they are assembled the total value will be &amp;pound;800k. This a considerable fraction of the Phase-I construction grant. In addition, this technology can be taken forward into the Phase-II Upgrade.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>E58F95E0-E96D-4449-8C1B-8369A6A034A6</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>56dd43d1da2513.47673088</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Electronics</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Silicon sensor systems for tracking at the high-luminosity Large Hadron Collider at CERN.

This project has an ongoing programme to develop the pixel modules. This includes design of sensors and interconnects to the readout electronics. Prototype sensors have been developed and tested both in the laboratory and in testbeams, and have shown good performance. Novel interconnect technology for thin modules is being developed.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The results of the research are published in peer reviewed journals and presented at international conferences.
