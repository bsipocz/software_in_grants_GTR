The *Sophist* is an important and influential work of Plato. Many articles on it have been written in recent years but no monograph has been recently published in English. My proposal aims to fill this gap. \nThe main question addressed by Plato in the *Sophist* is that of how it is possible to state or believe falsehoods. The falsehood paradox provides reasons for claiming that it is impossible to state or believe falsehoods. The main version of the falsehood paradox considered in the *Sophist* is the following argument: \n(1) To state a falsehood is to state what is not. \n(2) It is impossible to state what is not. \n(3) Therefore it is impossible to state falsehoods\nParallel steps lead to the result that it is impossible to believe falsehoods. Most philosophers, including Plato, reject the claim that it is impossible to state or believe falsehoods: they stand by the commonsensical view that stating and believing falsehoods is not only a possibility, but also a fact (however regrettable). Of course, philosophers base their rejection of the counter-intuitive claim that it is impossible to state or believe falsehoods on a refutation of the reasons that support it. The refutation usually targets premiss (2), the claim that it is impossible to state what is not (I focus on the case of stating-that of believing can be treated analogously). \nThe strategy adopted by Plato to reject premiss (2) is radically different from the one preferred by most modern philosophers. Modern philosophers introduce a special type of existent item, namely propositions. When one makes a statement, one carries out a speech-act that is exercised over a proposition. Some propositions are true whereas others are false. Since there is a use of 'to be' and 'not to be' whereby it means (respectively) 'to be true' and 'to be false', it is after all possible to state what is not (i.e. what is false). According to these modern philosophers the apparent problem depends on a confusion about 'to be', which can be taken to mean 'to exist'. It would be impossible to state what 'is not' in the sense of stating what does not exist (because then there would be nothing to state), but that is not the sense in which stating what is not is required for false statement. \nPlato takes a completely different approach. In his view to state what is not in the way required by falsehood is to state about something an attribute which is not about that thing. Suppose I make a false statement by saying that London is in Kenya: I am stating being-in-Kenya about London when being-in-Kenya is not about London. Plato then offers a reductive analysis of what it is for an attribute not to be about something: an attribute F is not about an object x just in case F is different from everything that is about x (e.g. being-in-Kenya is not about London in that being-in-Kenya is not about London is differenr from everything that is about London). \n\nLet me conclude with a more general remark. The problem of not-being is extremely fascinating: how can we think about what is not there? Plato's answer to this problem has provoked reflection and challenged commentators for centuries. It still provokes us (I see this in the reaction of students in class when I teach the course). The book I am planning to complete will provide an extremely clear account of what moves Plato makes to address this question. \n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-07-17</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-04-18</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>24113</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>They have been quoted by scholarly journals that address related areas of research.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>151A853C-0213-466E-851C-F281ABBFB151</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:outcomeId>5442984e195300.94166970</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>I have offered a new interpretation of one of the most difficult and important aspects of Plato's mature philosophy.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>My findings may contribute to a reassessment of the development of philosophy of language in the classical phase of Greek philosophy.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>BBCC6065-B9FB-461E-8670-94AC5EADACF7</gtr:id><gtr:outcomeId>544297e6e07ca1.89976964</gtr:outcomeId><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/H002707/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>66751786-9917-41F1-A8BB-CE06F47C2453</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Classics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>946C0541-464B-43A5-9EE3-65C23360E959</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Philosophy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6E6227B6-029E-4DD5-8ADF-6D46BE6CEE4D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Language &amp; Philosophical Logic</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B3A6F504-CFE6-4113-BBAE-292550B98DEE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Philosophy, Thought &amp; Religion</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
