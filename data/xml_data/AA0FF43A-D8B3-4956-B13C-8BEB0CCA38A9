Energy system practice change is happening more quickly in some countries and US States with respect to technology use, new entrants, business models, customer engagement and ownership, and this system change appears to be speeding up and becoming increasingly decentralised. 

Through the ECF, seven issues have emerged about the scale, speed and scope of changes in energy practices by new actors around the world. These are: (1) that there are increasingly rapid changes in many other countries, as explained above; (2) that there appears to be a social, technical, and economic tipping point in favour of a new energy trajectory, even while energy systems remain dominated by fossil fuels; (3) the nature of change appears to be leading to an increasingly co-ordinated but increasingly decentralised energy system; and some changes appears to have their own momentum - like a group of birds 'flocking' or a starling's 'murmuration'. This pattern of change raises (4) concerns about possible disruption, either physical or economic; and whether Britain could 'manage' the transition process; (5) questions about the nature of the future energy system; (6) whether the form that change is taking and the types of energy governance responses in different countries are related to their differing political economy institutions; and finally (7) concerns that the current fossil fuel disinvestment campaign will have an unexpectedly rapid impact on energy systems, with implications for governance.
The Fellowship Extension (FE) will explore these issues, and their implications for GB energy governance. Research into, examination of, and subsequent dissemination of these issues to inform British policy and institutions are essential because: (1) policy makers need to know what is happening elsewhere in the globe to understand the potential impacts and opportunities of similar changes here; (2) it seems likely that co-ordinated decentralisation enabled by ICT is a change in energy systems of a scale and nature that is unprecedented, having rapid, large impacts on infrastructure, ownership, business models, and social preferences, and together the impacts from which are not fully understood or necessarily controllable; (3) co-ordinated decentralisation may be a successful way to connect individuals thereby facilitating a quicker move to a smarter, more efficient, demand focused system; (4) technological pathways in co-ordinated decentralisation might better reduce potential negative impacts of disruption or further enable a better 'management' of disruption. 

These issues lead to three phases of analysis: the nature of change; what are the responses to change; and contextualising change. The answers will have important implications for governance of the GB energy system, especially in relation to how it can develop policies and institutions that provide greater flexibility, adaptability and responsiveness. The key questions of the FE are set out in detail in the Diagrammatic Work-Plan. 

There would also be two phases of dissemination. This is discussed in detail in the Pathways to Impact and is made up of: firstly, a conclusions and recommendations phase which would summarise key outcomes for different audiences. And secondly, in addition to standard academic aims of journal publication etc, a principal dissemination goal of the FE would be to become a web hub to further engage in debates on energy system change with further blogging, a more active presence on twitter, working towards the publication of a MOOC; with webinars, workshops, and greater international links.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This Fellowship will make a vital contribution to the understanding and development of energy governance and system change. We anticipate that this research will be relevant to a wide range of stakeholders as energy system change (electricity, heat and transport) affects all energy actors and users. This will include those directly involved with, or with an interest in, energy systems and achieving a transformation to a low carbon economy. 

Central to our planned impact for the Fellowship Extension (FE) will be a MOOC (Massive Open Online Course). This innovative approach is increasingly used to enable greater participation with knowledge creation. The University of Exeter's Climate Change group and Business School have already run very successful MOOCs (over 16,000 took part in the Climate MOOC and it is now being re-run) and we plan to learn from them, to ensure our own free online course reaches a broad range of participants. 

We envisage the MOOC's focus will be on the themes of Governance and Energy System Innovation and Change - bringing the findings of the first Fellowship with those within the FE. The MOOC will provide around 20 hours of teaching and include videos, case studies, key blogs, etc. It is anticipated that the MOOC will be of interest to academia (academics, research groups, students); energy system actors (suppliers, generators, network companies, regulators); policymakers (BiS, DECC, Defra); wider civil society (NGOs, investors, consumer groups, individuals and local authorities); the energy and wider media; and those involved within technology development and deployment from across the innovation chain; 

Additionally, we will be undertaking the following activities (which may also provide content for the MOOC), to provide routes to wider dissemination of our research and findings: 
- 5 research workshops with up to 30 people, and then the outputs placed on the web
- At least 5 webinars, each with up to 100 participants, again to be recorded to allow for further dissemination. 
- Website- building, further blogging, to turn it into more of a knowledge hub. 

The FE research is extremely international, and the team has a wide set of contacts. We will build on the existing contacts and seek new collaborations. Prof. Mitchell has secured 2 visiting fellow positions in the US (Berkeley and Columbia) and the role of Visiting Professorship at the Freie University of Berlin. We will also build on the links we have created in Denmark with DTU, Aalborg University, Copenhagen Business School, Danask Energi, Dansk Fjernvaerme and DERA; and with Germany: Agora Energiewende; E3G Berlin; EMST; Freie Universitat Berlin (including urba; SWP Berlin; Prognos AG; Leibniz IRS; and the ICIR at Potsdam.

Nationally we have established the importance of the Fellowship research themes with a number of key organisations, e.g. Ofgem, DECC, the ECC Select Committee, CCC, network companies, the CMA, as well as NGOs and energy media, such as Business Green, Cornwall Energy Spectrum, Carbon Brief and ECIU. We intend to inform them of a FE, were it to be awarded and maintain a flow of information.

We have also made links with several key research energy research groups in GB during the existing Fellowship, to share insights, avoid duplication and to talk about opportunities for joint working, etc. We will continue to develop these relationships and will both engage with these stakeholders during the research process and share our findings as the project progresses, but also attempt to build more collaborations through the research. We anticipate that some of these networks will become involved with the webinars/workshops/MOOC.

It is anticipated that this research will have direct policy implications and we will seek to maximize the sharing of knowledge that is gained through the dissemination and engagement routes highlighted above.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1110540</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication><gtr:id>C37DA578-2D6B-4DEC-A661-668FF24E42D4</gtr:id><gtr:title>The governance of industry rules and energy system innovation: The case of codes in Great Britain</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Utilities Policy</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/person/4ea7f6cf7ac22d8dcdd545c3e46481ee"><gtr:id>4ea7f6cf7ac22d8dcdd545c3e46481ee</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lockwood M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:outcomeId>5a2fe333312519.12037910</gtr:outcomeId></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/N014170/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F95121C7-7C31-40CE-BDBC-1E2BF025AEA6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Energy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>727D5AC5-FC06-46C6-BFC1-1EFE288337B2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sustainable Energy Vectors</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
