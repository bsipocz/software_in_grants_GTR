Question is, if a person has a hearing loss now, how accurately can we predict how much worse their hearing loss will get in the future? How well can we predict who of those people who do not have a hearing loss will stay that way? Some children are diagnosed with Auditory Processing Disorder ? how does that progress? Does it continue, deteriorate, or even recover as people age? The purpose of the research in this programme is to develop the science to answer some of these questions. As well as giving important new science, the research will be of assistance in measuring the effectiveness of hearing screening programs, as well as perhaps helping to predict who will gain benefit from any innovative new treatments that result from future discoveries in the biomedical science of hearing.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>How does hearing impairment progress in an individual? It is well known that the prevalence of hearing loss increases rapidly with older age, especially for people in the sixties, seventies or older, and many of the major risk factors have been identified. Much less, however, is known about the rate and manner at which an individual?s own hearing deteriorates: how accurately can one predict someone?s future hearing? Many previous longitudinal studies of hearing have used only questionnaires or pure-tone audiometry to measure hearing, yet recent scientific and clinical advances in hearing have shown that hearing impairment can manifest in ways that are hidden in the audiogram ? ?hidden hearing loss? ? such as in temporal-fine structure tests, signal-to-noise ratio tests, spatial-hearing tests, speech-in-speech tests. Hearing difficulties also occur in children, and though some are well understood, the progression of some types, especially auditory processing disorder, are far less clear. The scientific questions underpinning this research programme therefore include (1) does a temporal fine structure loss prefigure a later threshold loss (or vice versa)? (2) with what accuracy can a prediction be given about someone?s hearing impairment in 5 or 10 years? (3) are the risk factors for the other domains of hearing the same (and apply to the same strength) as for thresholds? (4) can we develop suitable clinical tests? This programme will deliver fundamental scientific data on how hearing difficulties progress in adults and children. This new science may also be of relevance to any future NHS national screening programme for hearing loss, as data on the progression will be crucial to determining the effectiveness of screening tests, as well as perhaps defining who will be prime candidates for innovative treatments from future discoveries.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.ukri.org:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-04-07</gtr:start><gtr:type>EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>289106</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>AoHL Technology Day</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EF0CD6A9-6FA3-4230-ACF3-3219C2294960</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A keynote talk at the Action on Hearing Loss Technology event .
